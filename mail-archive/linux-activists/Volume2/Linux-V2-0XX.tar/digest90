Talking about malloc(), malloc.h uses the macros PTR and FEXPR
(or something like that) from ansidecl.h to declare functions.
Malloc.h doesn't include ansidecl.h, however, and this can cause
a lot of spurious "parse error before '('" errors, if you include
malloc.h straight.

I just added an #include <ansidecl.h> to the start of malloc.h.
This fixed quite a few little problems.

  Seems to me that ash inserts a '\201' character before every equal
sign '=' in shell script parameters $1, $2, $3 etc. Run the following
shell script named 'foo':

  cat > bar <<EOF
  $1
  EOF
  od -c bar

with:

  ash foo a=b

and you'll get the following output:

  0000000   a 201   =   b  \n
  0000005

This caused me trouble while compiling groff with ash as /bin/sh.

Actually, I have one that is pretty SysV compatible. Someone (I forgot the

If you don't want to be able to dial out with that modem, it is just a matter
of putting the right line in /etc/inittab and initialising the modem 
properly.

Otherwise, it is rather tedious...

No, the problem is that when I updated my patch, I took the # sign
out of the makefile and put it in the setup.S file so that I could
get 80x25 VGA mode preset to work.  Otherwise the assembler chokes.
Now setting SVGA_MODE=0 might as well #undef it.  I'll fix it and
send yet-another version to tsx-11.

In the readme file, there is a long ld line (ld mtools mdir mread ....) 
You have to type that in.  It links mtools to commands like mdir, dir
command, and mread, copy a dos file to linux.  then you type in mdir c:,
mread foo.ext, etc.

I've had exactly the same problem. After uncompressing the 0.95c+ 
bootimage under 0.12, I used cp to put it onto a floppy. This
resulted in the behaviour described above. It turned out that my

I don't think the problem is with your drive, I think it's better to
send the device driver writer back to the drawing board.

I am currently rewriting the Minix hard disk driver to increase its
performance, because it also has problems with IDE drives.  I've got
access to three IDE drives, of 100Mb, 120Mb and 200Mb.

The current Minix HD driver reaches reading speeds of 250, 60, and
500 kbps on them.  Note the slow speed for the 120Mb.  At the usual
rotational speed of 3600rpm, this is exactly 1k per rotation!  (The
native Minix block size).

I have got another HD driver that precomputes a lot of data in advance,
programs the controller to read/write a lot of sectors and then goes to
work at the interrupt level.  It can make 450, 500, and 600 kbps on each.

My guess is that the first two disks do not have a track cache and the
third one does.  The current Minix HD driver can't keep up with the
120Mb disk.

I am trying to make a device driver that works like the second one but
does not use the ugly interrupt routine (it seems to hang sometimes),
but uses message passing instead at the expense of a few context
switches.  Early results (the paint is still wet) show speeds within 5%
of the ugly driver.

Further comments:
- I don't know what the Linux AT disk driver looks like, a Linux
  enthousiast should check it out to see if I'm right.  (I don't have
  any Linux code, I would probably label everything as "ugly". :-)

- Using a raw device and reads of 127kb it is possible to reach
  800 kpbs on the 200Mb disk using the "ugly" driver.  Getting the
  controller to transfer many sectors at once seems to be the trick.

- The drive doesn't have to translate the parameters as often for large
  transfers.  (Not that I think that the "translate" vs. "native" mode
  thing is very important.)

- The file system must be able to send large read-ahead requests to the
  driver, so it has something to work with.  Writing speed is not as
  important, but must be looked at too.  (Minix writes all dirty blocks
  for the same device at once if it must write one.)

[Back to making to floppy driver go 30% faster reliably, slow devices
seem to give more trouble than fast ones!]

Sorry folks, but I can't pass this one up.  Those who don't wish a lesson in
PRIMOS style dynamic linking should go on to your next article now.

Let's see if I can re-interpret this correctly.  A link from one routine
to another in the Prime Segmented architecture is called an IP (indirect pointer).
It is a pointer to the target object.  A Dynamic Link is a SPECIAL pointer
to a name.  The FAULT bit in the pointer is set.  This causes the hardware
to raise a POINTER_FAULT$ condition (PL/I style condition, similar to a
C signal).  The POINTER_FAULT is caught by any available condition handler
(ON UNIT in PL/I terms) currently on the stack, including those buried in
the operating system.  If the condition gets through to the OS, the OS
checks to see that the pointer less its fault bit is a valid pointer
to a character string in memory.  If so, it passes the pointer off to
the dynamic linking routines which methodically search (via a search list)
the dynamically linked libraries and OS entries.  Due to software compatibility,
three types of libraries are searched:  OS entries, EPF libraries, and
old static mode shared libraries that might be installed in our LIBTBL.
The entrypoint names are just a name.  Currently they are not qualified by
a library name and therefore the ENTRY$ search list specifies the order of
libraries to search looking for a name match.  If the name cannot be resolved
in ANY of the libraries in the search list, a new error condition is raised
(signalled): LINKAGE_FAULT$, and the name is a part of the information
associated with the error.

> the image mapped the index of the illegal address to a filename/symbol

If the name is found in a library, the library routine passes the address of
the routine back to the dynamic link handler which then REPLACES the faulted
pointer (which we call a DYNT) with the runtime address of the routine.  This
IP is now considered SNAPPED (resolved), and further references through this
IP are direct to the resolved routine.  In some respect this is doing the
final linking stage at runtime.

Yes, it probably could, but I don't know enough about 386 pointers to know
how to do something similar.  But, given that a 386 32-bit pointer consists
of a 16 bit segment number and a 16-bit byte offset, you would probably have
to make use of some kind of "missing memory" error or page fault to a
special non-existent page in order to do something similar, and tie the
dynamic linking support into the page fault handler in the kernel, which is
not as clean as having its own special fault handler.

Isn't this a problem with ANY new library that has to be re-linked to?

>       2) you could not page directly off the executable

Yes you can.  You just have to seperate the code part from the data part.  IPs
are a part of the data segment.  You can page the machine code part just fine.
This is what a segmented architecture is all about.

Yes again.  But see some of the advantages below.

Another disadvantage is that if you wish to remain upward compatible, you can never
remove an entrypoint from a library, lest some program which currently uses it
starts to fail.  At Prime, this is the "Compatibility Shall Reign Forever" syndrome.

> The advantages were:
>       1) no need to relink shared library programs

Unless the library entrypoint name changes.  But if that happens, you have
bigger problems anyways.

A side point here is that you don't need to keep around old compiled binaries
or pre-linked files either.  AND you will only ever have one copy of a shared
library installed on your system at any one time.  Saves on file system disk space.

Further more, you can still staticly link some programs if you really need it
if you have both shared and unshared copies of the libraries available on your
development system.

Possibly cuts down on working set.  You don't have to drag along unused baggage!

Probably true, however, if you carry around multiple versions of a library just
because it is no longer possible to re-link some old programs which were linked
with a previous version of the library, I don't see what you are saving!  Your
savings are being diminished by the "extra" libraries you have on disk, and code
that is not being shared at runtime!

Probably not dramatically enough for your tastes.  The Prime 200 and 300 was a FORTRAN
machine.  And we used FTN-66 as our systems programming language at that time.
When we released the 400 (and every subsequent machine), it was really a PL/I machine.
And we changed our system programming language (and our operating system) to reflect that.

Compatibility left us with the result you saw.  (Go ahead, and tell me UNIX doesn't have
compatibility problems from rev to rev.  It is its WORST problem.)

Sorry to drag this out, but every point made here needs to be considered when
we do dynamic linking for LINUX.  I am interested in hearing other's
points of view, and listening to the way others have implemented
dynamic linking.  But I beleive that Prime made "all the right decisions"
