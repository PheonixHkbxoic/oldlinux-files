All your have to do is add a "km:" in the middle of the console entries

km --  Tell the program that the terminal has a meta key.

Subject: Re: Keyboard lockups SOLVED (i.e. worked around)
Date: 21 Apr 92 18:27:01 GMT


Here is the real fix to the trouble I and others have had
with keyboard lockups and LED malfunction. I think this
should be included in the next release, but I don't know 
the proper procedure for doing so. I post it here because
others have reported the same or similar problem.

The problem was that the keyboard would lock up when pressing
either of CAPS, NUMLOCK, SCROLL LOCK. The 'bug' shows up only
on some hardware. The fix as suggested by Bruce Evans was to
add a routine called kb_ack that waits until 0xfa shows up on
port 0x64, and call after outputting data to port 0x60. I am not
sure what the exact meaning of these ports are, but the patch
that follows fixes the lockups and makes the LED's work!

Thank you Bruce Evans.

Just a wild guess, but boot from your ORIGINAL BOOT floppy using your
ORIGINAL ROOT floppy (you do still have those, don't you?).  And mount
your current hard disk on /mnt.  Now you should be able to "cd /mnt/etc"
and undo whatever you did with shoelace.

I happend to find timebin.tar.Z on tsx-11 yesterday, and downloaded
to my LINUX machine.  I untarred it, configured it, and moved the
binaries to /usr/bin and /usr/lib.  I then ran date, and it told me
it was Mon 20 Apr, 20:xx:xx 1992.  No time zone info, even though
/usr/lib/localtime was present.  I then ran clock to see what was in
my CMOS clock, and it was Sat 20 Apr, 14:xx:xx EDT 1992.

I think I can understand the 14:00 bit (If I chalk it up to
the GMT-EDT difference), but Saturday?????

Head parking is suggested (by me anyways) as necessary before powering
off your computer.  Who knows what the older hard disk controllers
will do when you turn the power off, and the write line happens to
accidently spit something out.  Good way to trash whole tracks.

Used to happen all the time on my CP/M system, until I learned to
park the heads before powering down.  If your drive doesn't recognize
the power fail, your disk controller probably doesn't either, and you could
lose something.  Probably happens less today than a few years ago,
but if you're using MFM drives, the chance is significantly increased.

The dd command is used to create a file of a specific size.  It needs
to be able to copy data from somewhere, so we allow it to copy data from
the hard disk; it doesn't matter what input it has, as long as it is
bigger than the swapfile to be created.  There is no danger that
swapping will overwrite your files, at least not just from using dd
with if=/dev/hda to create them.

    I guess I havent made myself clear. I would like to do something like this,
    where I would create a superset of the vt100. But the mode as it is, is
    insufficient for the kind of graphics I am talking about. I want to also add
    this new mode to the telnet program (when it gets written), so that the
    graphics get displayed remotely. 

I think Alex misled us a bit by saying 'vt100'.  Perhaps he was thinking
of the vt100 emulation in MS-Kermit or NCSA telnet, where the emulator
switches to Tektronix 401x mode for graphics when it recognises certain
escape sequences.  This might be a good place to start, since the source
code for both of these is available, though the Kermit version is a good
deal less buggy.  Moreover, as far as conformity with existing interfaces,
there is a TeX previewer that works rather well with the vt100/t4012
emulator in Kermit.

This was caused by an illegal (!) /dev/tty; it has now been fixed in the
release disks, and the larger (job control) version of bash moved to the
boot disk.  To fix it on your system, type

     rm /dev/tty
     mknod /dev/tty c 5 0
     chmod 222 /dev/tty

I have been trying to keep up a BUGS+WARNINGS file in the mcc-interim/0.95c+

This may be caused by your having the wrong terminal type.  Type
'echo $TERM' and see what it says.  If it says 'vt100', vi will work
the way you describe.  If it says 'console' or some such name, then this
note is a waste of time!

You might create a file /etc/profile, making sure it has universal read
permission, and put in it a line

     EXPORT TERM=console

that is, unless you have login from serial ports.

Date: 22 Apr 92 01:45:46 GMT

Ok.  I installed Linux yesterday (0.95c+), and so far I love it.  I do, however,
have a few problems.  My machine:
        486/25 ISA bus with 4Mb RAM, OPTI chipset, AMI BIOS
        ET4000A based 16-bit VGA card (1Mb memory) as primary display
        Hercules monographics card as secondary display
        ESDI 120Mb Micropolis hard drive.
        5.25"/3.5" disk drives (3.5" is a:)

a) Shoelace doesn't come close to working.  When I followed the instructions in the
        readme that came with 0.95c+, I created a test floppy, and tried booting off
        that.  When I did, the BIOS boot sequence would work normally, check the
        existance of drives, and then it would read the first sector of my 3.5"
        drive and hang.  :(
b) No matter what super-vga mode I try, it doesn't work.  Typically it just shows me
        an 80x25 window into the specified screen size.  In other words, things scroll
        correctly, but it only starts after n extra lines below the bottom of the screen.
c) Where can I ftp a bash manual?

Thanks for helping the neophyte.
