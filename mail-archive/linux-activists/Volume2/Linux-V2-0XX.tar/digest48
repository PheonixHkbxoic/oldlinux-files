Subject: Function of Rawrite?
Date: 9 Apr 92 23:37:35 GMT


        What exactly is the function of rawrite?  The documentation says
it 'writes ANY binary file to a disk'.  

        This question is prompted by my inability to access rawritten files
from my linux system (installed on my hard drive).  I know the files on my
DOS system from which the floppies were rawritten to are good.  Someone 
suggested that, since 'tar' on my linux fails after the first couple of 
entries of a rawritten tar file, that the tar is bad.  I've heard a lot of
talk about bad 'tar's, but if that's the case (linix 0.95a , by the way),
how can I get a good tar onto my linix system.

        I would appreciate any help.  Please email unless you think this
merits further bandwith.  (Yes, I've read the FAQ, and the installation
guide and the newgcc FAQ, etc...)

I have also patched ka9q to work with it.  Right now it is buggy, but
it appears to be useable (I am using it to type this.).  I should have

        Has anyone actually been working on sockets or tcp/ip in the

trying to migrate some of the ethernet code into the kernel, or just
leave it like it is until someone comes up with a good generic
system.

Could you please also post the same thing for presetting

>1) does shoelace _need_ to be in the root directory?  Can I remove

Yes, shoelace does not work unless it is /shoelace.  You can never remove
it.  It is something like a /vmunix file, in that its name and location
are hard-coded into the bootstrap loader.  When shoelace starts to
execute it searches for /etc/config, another hard-coded file name.
A sample /etc/config comes with it.

These are a hangover from minix.  They should normally be commented
out in your /etc/config file.  Instead of /etc/system you should
use the Image file produced by a make in the linux directory.  I
keep this in /etc/Image, with the previous copy in /etc/Image.old.

>4) What is the file /usr/src/linux/linux/Image ? (Please tell me I'm

You must indeed recompile the kernel, that is, unless you get a
compiled kernel from somewhere.  The interim version of Linux
which I am about to release in Manchester contains a precompiled
kernel (0.95c).

>3) What is the file bootlace used for?  It's not mentioned in the
>    readme file.

bootlace contains the code which is (sometimes) written by laceup
into a file system's boot block.

>5) When is the file disktab used?

disktab is used when configuring a floppy to boot using shoelace.

>6) How exactly does winiboot work?  What does it do?

winiboot is the part of shoelace that goes into the hard disk's boot
sector, as opposed to the file system's.

When you install shoelace, you give the command

     laceup -w 1 /dev/hda

This puts the winiboot file into the hard disk's boot sector and
sets a default of partition 1 as the one which will boot if you
don't type anything within a certain period of time.  Then you
give the command

     laceup /dev/hda1 wini

This installs the bootlace code into the boot block of the linux
partition.  This code is executed by the code in sector 0, and
this code finds /shoelace and executes it.  /shoelace finds
/etc/config and uses its instructions to find /Image.  Once
shoelace is executed, you can interrupt by typing RETURN, and
it allows you to boot from some file other than the configured
one.

Shoelace is pretty out-of-date and designed for a completely
different system.  We need someone to write a replacement.

I believe this is by design.  Tar with z simply pipes its output
through compress, and compress doesn't support multi-volume output.

I don't know about a ksh yet, since the public domain one is said
to be less than ideal.  But you CAN use vi to edit command lines in
bash.  Simply create a file .inputrc in your home directory containing

     set editing-mode vi

and it should work like vi: ESC enters edit mode, and most of the
usual vi commands work in the usual manner, including / and ?.

Hello all!

I've had linux running on my machine now for about months. When running .12
I never had any trouble with reading from floppies.  
Unfortunately very soon after I installed .95 and repartitioned my hard drive
to make a 64 Meg partition, I had troubles reading any file at all above
300 or 400k to the file system without corrupting it.  I've tried just about
everything I can to try to find out what the problem is.  I've recompiled 
mtools a few times, written tar files to disks, tried zmodem and even used
the .12 kernel again with the same results.

Before this all started happening I was able to install gcc2.0, 1.4 prolog and
other packages.  Unfortunately I can't get groff, tex or any games onto my 
system.

My configuration is:
386/25
8 Meg Ram
3.6 Meg swap
Opti chip set
AMI Bios
5.25" floppy A
3.5" floppy B
Seagate 1144A IDE hard drive

Thanks,

Subject: More hard drive questions....

Hello everyone,

I have been experimenting with Linux for about a month now from floppy,
and am considering installing it on my hard drive sometime over summer,
once I'm back home.  So far, I have been VERY impressed with the speed
of Linux.  Very nicely written.  Also, as an aside, my 486-33 runs fine,
with the exception below, at both 8MHz and 33MHz.  I know some people
were having problems at high speeds....  It's a TPE motherboard.  Real
nice.

Anyways, back to my problem.  If I use fdisk to attempt to read the
partition data off of my hard drive, it doesn't report anything, just
returns to the prompt.  Using pfdisk doesn't work either.  My questions
are:

1.  Does Linux support 2 drive controllers in 1 machine?  I have 2
controllers in mine (1 MFM, 1 RLL), and it runs fine under DOS (albeit
with a device driver to read the second controller)

2.  Does Linux read the hard drive data from CMOS?  I have to leave my
CMOS hard drive entries blank in order for the system to boot.  (Maybe
I'll try an AT controller board one of these days...)

3.  Is there anything else that I need to know to make a HD work?

Thanks.

And a HUGE thanks to Linus, and all the people porting software over to
Linux.  Can't wait to see X, with or without network support!  Any ideas
how long before at least a late alpha or beta release is available? 
(Size??  8-)

FYI - running bootimage .95c+ (from tsx-11)
              rootimage .95a  (    ""     )

4 MB memory
/dev/at0
/dev/PS1

1st hard drive: Miniscribe 10 MB with Omni controller (primary bootable)
2nd drive: Seagate 60MB (2 30MB partitions) with a WD RLL controller.

Oh, one other thing before I forget, is it possible to change the screen
size once the kernel has been loaded?  It would be nice to be able to
switch between 80x25, and 132x44 with a setterm option.  Just curious.
