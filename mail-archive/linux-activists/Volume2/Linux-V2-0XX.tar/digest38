Sounds good to me.  But there has never been source code available for any
of the versions of gcc, so far as I know, nor diffs against the fsf distribution.
I hope there will be.  I have never found source code for update.  The source
code I have for fsck doesn't come close to compiling with the current linux
include files.  I'm going to work on fsck.c (I question whether fsck -m works
properly now), but since I don't understand the filesystem, my prospects aren't
very good.

Anybody with any source, please upload.

If "nothing happens" means that mcopy returns without doing anything,
you've probably forgotten to make links for mread and mwrite. mcopy
execs mread or mwrite to do the transfers, but it doesn't warn when
the exec fails. Fix: chdir to the directory where mtools live and do
a  ln mtools mread; ln mtools mwrite  (or, if you're not using the
merged version, compile mread and mwrite and put them in the approp-
riate directory.)

If "nothing happens" means that mcopy hangs and has to be killed with
^C, you've probably compiled mcopy.c without -DMERGED. mcopy sets
argv[0] of the execed mread/mwrite to "mcopy" if -DMERGED is omitted,
which breaks the merged mtools. Fix: re-compile mcopy.c with -DMERGED

   I remember reading a post here not too long ago from the person who was writing
   gnu FORTRAN.  I was wondering if this person, whose name I can not recall, has
   considered porting FORTRAN to Linux.  I would like to see if I can get Spice2g6
   ported to Linux, but parts of it (lots of it) are written in FORTRAN and
   I think
   it would be a Major job to translate them into C.

Hi, that was me.  If (99% likely) and when (within a month or so) I do get
a 486 box and start getting Linux up and running, I indeed would like to use
it as my main Fortran-compiler-development machine.  BUT, that might take a
while (especially if I have to do driver development to get my peripherals
working) and in the meantime I'll likely be modeming in to a Sun4 to do the
Fortran work.

Furthermore, GNU Fortran hasn't even reached alpha test yet, though from a
technical perspective it's pretty close (testing and some backend changes to
get COMPLEX support working still needed).

I suggest you ftp to research.att.com, login as netlib (I think; maybe it's
anonymous ftp, but I think they changed that), get f2c from ~dist/f2c or
some such place, and use that to compile your Fortran code for use on Linux.
f2c is pretty good; it's free (public domain); and when GNU Fortran comes
out (as alpha), it'll be inter-module compatible with f2c-compiled programs.
(f2c comes with it's own I/O and intrinsic libraries, so it ought to be quite
easy to get it running under Linux.)

If nobody seems to have gotten f2c ported to Linux by the time I get Linux
working on my machine, I'll do it myself and let people know what changes,
if any, need to be made.  I doubt it'll be much; I've gotten f2c running on
two 68k machines (HP and NeXT) and a Sun4 with a trivial amount of work.
(On the other hand, I haven't run a whole lot of Fortran code through it
anywhere, yet.)

        There's a lot of good reasonds for distributing binaries.  Emacs
18.58 is a good reason!  The source code is 4 megabytes compressed, and
the time it would take to compile it on a 16mH SX with 2 megs of ram and
a slow hard drive would be measured in days.  Don't even think about X.

        Minix is mostly a 16 bit OS, and has silly silly size limits to
everything.  Linux is different because it can compile and run HUGE programs.
(I easily ported gnuchess, try that on Minix.)  Also, keeping the source
code around for all the utilities you need can be pretty hard on a limited
sized hard drive.  Further, what compiles on gcc1.37 may not compile on
1.40 or 2.0 or 2.1 (it should, but....)  It's just so much more convenient.
        I like the idea, however, of keeping around sources and diffs.
Shared libraries are one of them.  I think that keeping binaries, even though
some day they may break, are a good idea also.

well, i've read the FAQ sheet and i am unimpressed. :-)

or more precisely, i am showing remarkable restraint and calm in the
light of the information on this FAQ list.  i will refrain from rapid,
perhaps unthinking, decisions.  i will not drool *too* much.  wild,
incoherent singing in the middle of the night will be kept to an absolute
minimum.

hence, like any potential guinea pi..., err, customer, i have some
more questions before i sign my life away to LINUX:

1) is there a driver for my beautiful Adaptec 1542B card?  how difficult
   is it to make such a thing on a single diskette only system (which is
   what i would be left with)?  trivial 30 minute operation, or success
   would be only marginal after 4 months of 24hr non-stop hacking sessions?

2) is the file system size *really* limited to 64 megabytes?  this is a
   really serious flaw if true for (a) simple aesthetic reasons and (b)
   practical reasons for those with large disks ...  and if true, can this
   be easily fixed?  i have absolutely no care in the world about
   compatibility with MINIX file systems, or any other for that matter.
   i just want peak, or close to peak, fs performance.

otherwise, LINUX is looking like what i an looking for.  i have had it with
COHERENT and its 64+64 business and disgusting disk performance...

but its still a toss up between 386 BSD or LINUX.  but i haven't found out
anything about the BSD other than the fact it exists, is free, and a friend
tells me it panics alot...

Date: 7 Apr 92 08:20:03 GMT


Sorry to be a real pain in the but, but here's the next installment in
the ongoing saga of 'Scott Tries To Install Linux'.

Early this morning playing around trying to get things to work.  Decided
to boot up with 0.95 as suggested in I Reid's Beginners Guide.  Made an fs,
rebooted, and it worked, no probs.  Tried 0.95a and :

8 virtual consoles
4 pty's
HD timeoutHD timeout .......
dev 0300, block 0
Unable to read partition table of device 0300
HD timeoutHD timeout .......
dev 0340, block 0
Unable to read partition table of device 0340
Partition tables ok.                    /* Wonderful !!!! */
harddisk I/O error
dev 0341, block 1
Kernel panic : Unable to mount root

Back into 0.95, decided to install a few choice pieces of s/w just so
I could at least have a decent look around.  Everything worked, except
mtools (mcopy wouldn't work).  However on the whole it worked.

Before switching off, decided to reboot with 0.95a, just in case.
Amazing, it worked.  Closed eyes, took a deep breath, tried again, it
worked.  Installed some more s/w, mtools working properly.  Couldn't
install gcc at all.  One tar seems to be corrupted, one other returns
with 'out of swap space' and yet another does nothing.

Switched off, went to bed.

6.30 am, getting ready to leave, decided to try out linux,
0.95a - see above error message,
        switch to picture of me stomping around room (quietly) tearing
        at imaginary 'things' culminating in an almighty roar.
        Yes Linus, when you woke up at 6.30 and said 'What the ****
        was that?', now you know.

Tried again,
0.95 - works
0.95a -
HD timeoutHD timeoutHD timeoutHD timeout Partition tables ok.
39488/43545 blocks
14327/14515 inodes
226 buffers - 241424 bytes buffer space
Free mem : 1310720 bytes
All systems functioning

(none) Login :

0.95a seems to work in the above manner 1 in 10 attempts.  I am doing
nothing strange between reboots.

I would really appreciate it if somebody who could help would mail me
or post the group.  My configuration is as detailed in my previous 2 posts
and everything mentioned in them still holds

Remeber I can get 0.95a to works from hda1.  But for the moment at least
I need to keep DOS as it is installed.

Any help much appreciated,

Scott.

The extra money buys substantially higher performance.  The Seagate is
the bottom-of-the-line.  It uses the CPU heavily, and doesn't support
non-Seagate drives too extensively.  I don't know what kind of software
is available for tape or CD-ROM drivers.

The Adaptec 1542B is on the opposite end of the spectrum.  It's a
bus-master disk controller, and has very high performance if your
motherboard can handle it.  Software support is excellent.

At the higher end are EISA type controllers, and below the 1542B
are non bus-master controllers that are a lot smarter and faster
than the ST-01/02.

Subject: HELP! Problems with rootimage.
Date: 7 Apr 92 12:48:47 GMT

I reported this problem two weeks ago but got no help.
So, here it is again.

I got rawrite.exe, bootimage and rootimage (0.95a) from nic.funet.fi.

I booted with bootimage diskette in drive A and Linux told 
me 'Loading....'.Then I selected one of the listed video modes.
Linux told me to insert rootimage diskette in drive A and press
ENTER. I inserted it and pressed enter. Diskette drive light
and motor went on for a second and that was all. Nothing else
happened.

I got a new copy from nic.funet.fi and tried again - still
didn't work. I have tried it on three different machines
but it doesn't work! Unfortunately all of those machines 
are 486/33 with AMI BIOS dated 05/05/91 or 06/06/91, so
I don't know whether it is a BIOS problem. My machine has
OPTI chipset, the other two have some other chipset.

Am I doing something totally wrong? 
I get rootimage.Z from nic.funet.fi (yes, binary mode is on),
uncompress it and write it to a floppy disk (1.44Mb) using
rawrite.exe. 
What should I do? 

Please at least tell me to shut up if I'm wrong. This uncertainty
is killing me.
