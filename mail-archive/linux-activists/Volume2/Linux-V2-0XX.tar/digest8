   Basically, you defragment the drive, so all of the empty space is at
   the end, and then just change the partition table.  And the FAT table.
   And some other things....  There was a detailed post on this about a
   month and a half ago, I believe.  In princip~ql it's easy.  In
   practice, it's difficult.

Could someone with these instructions please mail them to me?  I don't
want to use it right now, but I should have some appendix in the
manuals that explains how to do this with appropriate warnings.

(I know how to change the PT, but how to modify the FAT was
non-obvious when I looked at it yesterday)

Thanks,

I saw this mentioned some time ago, but never found any replies to the
original message, so I thought I'd ask it again.

I'm trying to install Linux on a RLL disk, driven by a Seagate ST21/22R
controller.  The procedure (so far) is as follows:

        1.  Boot 0.95a floppy.   Answer SVGA mode, Insert root floppy.
        2.  Login as root.  Try fdisk.  Fdisk returns *nothing*!!!

        Yep, nothing.  just a prompt.

        3.  Try pfdisk /dev/hda.  The dialogue goes something like this:

        After several messages about geometry, and one obnoxious message
        about 'bad magic number in boot sector, magic number corrected,
        but the rest of the boot program is probably garbage.' I start 
        attempting to create a partition.

           pfdisk> G 1024 8 26
           pfdisk> 1 6 0 511
           pfdisk> 2 128 512 1021       # 1022,1023 for landing zone, etc.
           pfdisk> a 1
           pfdisk> wq

        4.  Sync 3 times, logout, reboot.

        After this, fdisk still reports *nothing*!   Pfdisk will find the
        partitions I created earlier, however.

The only thought I had was that perhaps the controller bios needs to be
disabled, and go strictly from the PC rom/bios (and drive tables).  If so,
I still have a problem, finding a formatter that will format the drive at
26 sectors/track, without the controller bios.  

So, does anyone have any ideas?  I'm open to even the most ludicrous of
suggestions, at this point, I'll try (almost) anything.

Thanks Ahead!

Hi all,

In what follows you willl find a few information about the linux FAQ

1) I'll post in a short while to news.answers the OLD Faq (i.e.
the one posted recently by Kevin Cummings)

2) comp.os.linux has not yet appeared to my site, so I have to
postponed the post to that group.

3) If you have *any* suggestion for the FAQ, please mail to
linux@numero6.greco-prog.fr (I need my mail box for my research discussions)

What's going wrong?
 51)  gcc complains about not finding crt0.o and the system
include files What am I doing wrong ?
 52)  While compiling some GNU packages gcc chokes on regex.c with
an insn code, what can I do?
 53)  I tried to port a /new/ version of gnu stuff. But in the
linking phase, gcc complains about the missing libg.a. In fact it
depends on the gcc package you use.
 54)  What are the device minor/major numbers?
 55)  How to start Linux from drive B?
 56)  The program boot_b works fine /but/ once the first disk is

everything work except that some keyboard keys produce wrong
characters. Does anyone know what is happening?
 71)  Does there exist shared libs ?
 72)  Does Linux permit/support bitmapped graphics on vga/svga 
cards?

 74)  I got the patches on some ftp sites, and applied them to the
kernel and tried to compile. It didn't !!. Are the patches buggy?
 75)  How can I backup my Hd under Linux ?
 76)  How to use setterm: for the novice?

 85)  While compiling some stuff, I'm getting the following 
error message:
Undefined symbol ___addsf3 referenced from text segment
as well as ___mulsf3 and __cmpsf2. 
These symbols are not in the program or in it's header files.
 86)  What are the enhancement of the newgcc.tar.Z ?
 87)  What can gcc-2.0 do for me, that gcc-1.40 cannot?
 88)  I've been trying to get Linux to run on my [3/4]86 box. It

The home archive site of Linux is nic.funet.fi.  Finger

Linux.

Here's the current finger info to avoid millions of finger connections:

Plan:

                Free UNIX for the 386

The current version of linux is 0.95a: it was released March 17th, and
is pretty close to what 1.0 will be : it needs some testing, but should
be good enough to use for many things.  0.95a contains mainly bug-fixes
to 0.95.

NOTE! NOTE! NOTE! Plain 0.95 had problems with some harddisks that
worked ok under 0.12, as well as a few bad bugs.  These have been
corrected (hopefully), but make sure you have the "a" version: the bugs
in plain 0.95 can crash your machine rather badly. 

Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)

install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused. 

Linux still requires an AT-compatible disk to be useful: there are
patches for a SCSI driver (currently ST-0[1|2]), but it hasn't made it
into the "official" kernel yet.  (The patches are against the 0.12
version, but they should work with little changes on 0.95)

There are now a couple of other sites containing linux, as people have
had difficulties with connecting to nic. The sites are:
        Tupac-Amaru.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE (137.226.112.31):
                directory /pub/msdos/replace
        tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
                directory /pub/linux

(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)

There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'. 
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'. 
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).

For those of you able to read the alt.* newsgroups, there is also a
linux newsgroup available: alt.os.linux, which should hopefully become a
comp.* group when the votings etc are ready.

Mail me for more info:

                Linus (torvalds@kruuna.Helsinki.FI)

0.95 contains these new things:

- ptrace (gdb is in beta-testing)
- VFS (at least a minimal stubs-version)
- bug-corrections (notably mm, but other bugs as well)
- better VC's (screen blanking, works on non-[EV]GA etc)
- init/login
- faster floppies

0.95a should correct these bugs in plain 0.95:

- floppy-reset gets called, and the machine may be unable to read
  floppies on certain hardware. 
- Some harddisks get read-errors (resulting in general protection errors
  etc)
- console and tty-drivers have known bugs - sometimes weird output when
  writing heavily to the screen. 
- extended partitions don't work after all.

While not part of the original question, it's worth mentioning that
Linux requires an ISA bus--no MCA )-;

   I strongly suspect that /pub/linux/binaries/compilers/gcc-2.0 at
   tsx-11.mit.edu does in fact contain gcc-2.1.  

Yup.  I've since renamed the directory to gcc-2.1, to reduce confusion.
Sorry about that!

Note the warning in the README file in this directory:

|NOTICE:  GCC v2 is still in beta-test, and as such these files are usually
|out of date within a day or two.  For the most recent copies, see the
|anonymous FTP site dec1.eecs.wsu.edu.
|
|Once GCC 2.x is more stable, this file (and this warning) will go away.


In other news, someone has compiled oleo and dropped it off on TSX-11.
(I'd appreciate it if people who did that also sent mail to
ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu --- thanks!)  It's now available in
~ftp/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/oleo.tar.Z

Tommy Thorn is working on integrating his adaptec driver into 
Drew Eckhardt's generic scsi package.

In the meantime, I do have an interim adaptec scsi version of
95a linux, based on Thorn's original hd.c driver.  This version also
has all of Linus' and Charles Hedrick's extended partition patches.
Full installation packages, including boot and root images are
available from anonymous ftp at sc.tamu.edu.
