Subject: IDE-drive performance with linux
Date: 16 Apr 92 09:02:33 GMT

Greetings,

don't know whether this belongs here, but I'm experiencing a serious
performance problem with my new IDE-drive under linux:
I'm using a 386DX-20Mhz board with 4 MB of RAM and an unmodified 0.95c+ kernel.
Recently I exchanged my 2 MFM drives for a Rodime (3259A I believe) 200 MB IDE-
drive because the old drives were rather slow and I had been running out of
disk space. With the new drive I noticed that the machine and even the keyboard
sort of froze under heavy disk I/O like running compress or tar.

I then tried to copy a 3 MB file from one partition to another. It took about
2 minutes to complete with the keyboard freezing sometimes! Even copying from
floppy drives isn't much slower. Copying the same 3 MB file under PC-DOS 4.0
on the same drive takes about 20 seconds!
I never had this sort of problem with my old MFM drives (20 MB Fuji and 40 MB
Seagate ST-251 with WD controller). BTW while recompiling the system drive
performance seems to be normal (takes about 20 minutes), at least I don't think
the MFM drives were faster on that.
Does anyone have explanations, hints, experiences? Any feedback is welcome.

Thanks in advance
Guido

Not at this time.  It would be pretty easy to fix though, if not 
a bit kludgy...
  
Attention fellow kernel hackers, and aspiring kernel hackers to be : 

Implementing dynamically linked shared libraries :
        A simple kludge.

(we definately want this so we CAN distribute everything in a shared form)

1.  There should be a temporary directory for keeping a linked 
        version of something compiled with shared libraries.
        Linking to a binary on disk allows us to keep the 
        existing mm routines that do demmand paging, and 
        sharing of pages between different copies of 
        the same program.

        This temporary directory would be set with a 
        syscall.  A user program, such as swapon,
        would be created to interface this, and 
        could be run from /etc/rc.

2.  When exec() is called, it checks for #!, and the a.out
        magic numbers.  We add a new magic number, saying 
        "This is a dynamically linked program."  If exec()
        encounters this magic number, it checks to see if 
        an already linked version of the program exists
        in the temp directory, and execs that if it does.

        Naming of the already linked version should be unique 
        across all file systems, probably combining inode #
        and dev # from which the file system is mounted.

        If this does not exist, then exec() execs /bin/ld.
        The shared version has been linked to everything but
        the shared library stubs.  It is now linked to
        shared library stubs stored in /lib/libstubs.a.  

        Note that crt0.s will have to change to use 
        /lib/greatest or whatever, instead of 
        the dated version number necessary with statically 
        linked shared libraries.

3.  exit(2) is modified so that when reference count reaches 0
        of that program, the linked version is unlink(2)'d from
        the temporary directory.

        
Advantages of this method :
1.  We don't introduce the bloat of ld(1) in the kernel.

2.  The existing mm code that handles page sharing, and demand
        loading continues to work.

3.  We still don't swap text to swap space.

4.  We get the adantages of dynamic linking, and can 
        safely distribute code that uses shared libraries.
   
Disadvantages :
1.  Execing /bin/ld is a BIG kludge.  

2.  We use disk space for the linked version + disk space for
        the unlinked version

You *CAN* keep an old version of the shared library binary around.
Otherwise yes.

(Barf, Puke, etc) : Agreed.  See above Super-{hack,Kludge} depending
on your perspective to rectify this situation.  If no one else does 
it, I might do it myself...

Downloadable character sets are not a problem ON EGA/VGA AND ABOVE.

On these cards, ALL text mode character sets are stored in unused pages of 
video memory.  They support two simulateously resident character sets.
Consult a technical reference.

It should be a simple matter to make a TTY driver IOCTL that supports
this feature of the EGA/VGA/SVGA cards.  

Other hardware may require a switch to graphics mode, and will require
a more substantial rewrite of the tty driver.

What do you mean trap?  Consult mmap(2), and use Zoerst's 
mmap() patches for the kernel.  

mmap(2) will map a file into your program's address space.  
When used with /dev/mem, this allows you to map any portion 
of the 4GB virtual address space into your processes' address
space, such as the frame buffer.

Obvious questions :

Are you using the SCSI kernel?  Stock .95c+ doesn't have the SCSI
support, the vmunix.Z from headrest.colorado.edu does.  You're 
a little hazy on this.

Do you have /dev entries for the SCSI disk(s)?  SCSI disks 
are major 8, minor where minor &0xf = partition #, 0
for the whole drive, minor >> 4 = disk number, starting at 
0, assigned dynamically in the order disks are found.

Statements  :
mkswap DOES NOT create a swap file.  It only writes the
swap signature, etc to a swap file or partition.
You have to use dd(1) to make a swap file.  

dd if=/dev/[hd sd as appropriate]0 bs=1024 count=[size in K] of=/swap

And then mkswap on that.

If you can read and write to the partitions, with something 
other than the mkswap program, it's a user problem.

1.  gdb does not work with the new .95c+ kernel.

        My guess is that internal structures changed

        I don't still have my .95a sources to verify this,

1.  You can't disable interrupts from a user program.
        A cli should cause a general protection fault, and 
        consequently a SIGSEGV.

2.  There is no gurantee that the memory you've read the 
        file into is present.  If you've disabled any interrupts
        the disk driver depends on... you'll be unhappy.

3.  Unix is NOT real time.  If you have the timer interrupt
        enabled so that the disk driver works, other 
        user programs will be scheduled, and there 
        will be "holes" in what you're getting.

You should write a character device driver that will read/write to/from 
the fs segment directly to/from your board, and not allow any other 
tasks to be scheduled while in the read/write.

   Does anyone know how I can recover the "LOCK-FILE".
I boot from floppy at0, then root is on hda4 which is ok.
hda6 (/usr) or any other filesystem does not mount.
hda1 158MB MSDOG
hda2/hda3 Minix
hda4/6 as described above for Linux (created by Minix fdisk).
         I hit this problem after perhaps removing a floppy from at0
and not umounting it, then mounting another floppy.
    Checking on Minix, everything on the Linux filesystems is still intact.
Using either 0.95a or 0.05c boot floppies, I get the following......
Partition tables ok
    ......
Free mem: 6291456 bytes

A suggestion would be for those people who are at sites which have not
yet processed the newgroup for comp.os.linux to mail there news-admin
and ask _nicely_ for them to process it.

I've no objection to that, the only problem being that will the
sysadmins who havent't newgrouped comp.os.linux honour the rmgroup ?
Despite that, however, it is definately worth a try.

I guess I should comment on this, since SCSI drivers are my 
project.

1.  SCSI devices with the *generic* SCSI package have always
        used major 8 for SCSI driver, and 9 is reserved for
        SCSI tapes, although nothing more than stubs 
        are there (right now).

2.  Tommy Thorn had a hacked-up hd.c that worked with
        adaptecs, that replaced the normal hard disk 
        driver.  

3.  The root device of 0301 on the distribution SCSI kernel     
        is what I use.  Normally, I get lazy,
        make a generic kernel that supports all 
        of the SCSI hosts, boot it and run it for a day or so
        to make sure it works, and upload that.

GNU m4 1.0 compiles without effort and runs, I suggest to use it as
standard Linux m4.

GNU chess 3.1 also compiles without effort.  I only compiled it for fun,
but it seems to work too.

I compiled both GNU awk 2.13 and mawk 1.1 (also without effort), but
both fail with the same problem:

awk -F @ '{ print $2 }'

foo@bar gives foo@bar as output, not only bar as expected.  Both GNU awk
and mawk work on SunOS 4.1.1 as expected.  I used gcc 1.40 as compiler,
on both Linux and SunOS.

sort from the GNU fileutils 3.2 compiles ok, but hangs in an infinite
loop.

I appreciate any hints.

If you post follow-ups, please send me a copy per email during next

This sounds like the mount point doesn't exist.  Did you "mkdir /user"
before you tried to mount?  By default, /user doesn't exist but /usr does.
You may also want to "mkdir /mnt" as a place to mount floppies onto.
