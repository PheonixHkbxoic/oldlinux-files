Interesting. I compiled a program with the April 6 version of gcc-2.1,
and it dies with "can't find lib92.04.06" and a segfault, even though
I've got the lib! Compile the same program with the static libs, it
just dies with a segfault (seems that strcpy() is f*). Could the
"can't find libxx.xx.xx" error show up under any circumstances other
than the library not being there?

BTW machine is 486-33, 4meg ram, 4meg swap. Kernel is 0.95c. And the
"can't find lib" message isn't *all* there -- usually a few
characters get hacked off the front, so it just says "ind libxx.xx.xx"
or some such. But sometimes I get the whole thing, so I know that's
what it is.

Unless you are not running with "new" disks.  There are an AWFUL lot of MFM
disk out there that don't auto-park; like most of them!  So unless you are
shutting down your system to reboot DOS (or something else), your disk
heads will not be parked by LINUX.  Maybe this is the cause of some of the
trashed file systems some people are experiencing?

The easiest thing to do is in setup.S, which runs while the machine
is still in REAL mode, and still has access to the video BIOS.

Generate an INT 10 request for a VGA only function.  Check the
AL (or is it AH) register upon return.  If it is 0, then a VGA
is present.  If it is the same as the function request number,
then a VGA is NOT present.  Do the same for an EGA or better
function to distinguish EGA from CGA.  You can also check the
machine equipment byte in the CMOS to distinguish color monitor
from monochrome.  A full method for doing this was described by
Dr. Dobbs Journal when they started their GRAPHICS column a couple
of years ago.  setup.S should be doing most of what they described
to determine the video type, and THEN try and figure out specific
card vendors.

I am running 0.95c+ from tsx-11.  When I boot, it tells me that lp1 and lp2
both exist in my system (note:  no lp0).  This is amusing since under
dos, my printer (when it was working) was connected to LPT1.  I suspect
that the line printers here suffer from the same problem as the serial
ports.  Under DOS (actually, under POST), the BIOS checks a list of IO
addresses sequentially and assigns the first addresses that is successful
to xxx1, the second to xxx2, etc  trying upt to 2 or 4 COM ports, and up to
3 LPT ports.  Is it true that unde LINUX there is a one to one correspondence
between an address and a LINUX device?  If so, then the parallel port
that is found on the old CGA/Monochrome cards is lp0, and the parallel ports
more commonly found on serial/parallel cards can be either lp1 or lp2.
I don't know what addresses are used by printer ports off the top of
my head, and I don't know which one is used on printer ports on motherboards.

Finally managed to get linux installed and working properly.  0.95c seems
to have solved the HD timeout problem I was having.  Thanks to everyone
who tried to help.  I think I replied to everyone, but if I didn't, sorry,
I deleted all the saved messages before replying to all.(silly)

Some miscellaneous questions (probably daft) :

1.      I am using tcsh, how do I set up paths to include and lib directories?
        This doesn't seem to be a problem, recompiled the kernel with no paths
        set up, other than path for binaries etc.
        However, gcc -g (debug info) gives the following link error :
                can't find libg   or something like that.
        I can't find what it's looking for.

2.      What is a working version of tar and un/compress?
        A lot of problems seem to be solved by getting new versions of the
        aforementioned.  However, nobody has indicated how to identify which
        are the dodgy copies.
        Sometimes when uncompressing it seems to get stuck in an infinite
        loop which takes all system resources.  ie I can't login to another
        terminal and kill the process.  Is this what is known as a 'race
        condition' ?  Is this indicate a dodgy copy of un/compress ?

3.      What are shared libraries?
        What are the implications of using shared libraries?
        I got a load of object files, I think it was 2.1-shared-A.tar.Z which
        apparently use them.  Certainly, once they were 'made' they were
        much smaller than the 'normal' equivelants.
        Are there limitations when using shared libraries?
        Are they like runtime libaries?

4.      Why are ccp and cc1plus(?) in my /lib directory with links to
        /usr/lib/..../ccp, cc1plus?
        When I first tried to use gcc, it failed saying it couldn't
        find them.  I just stuck /lib in my path, but this seems wrong
        to me.  I didn't move the aforementioned into /usr/bin on the
        assumption that they must have been put /lib for some reason.

5.      A number of utilities crash when I give valid syntax in an
        inapropriate situation. e.g.
                ls -l *.doc
        when there are no docs in the current directory.  Is this a bug
        in the kernel, the utilities (do they have to be recompiled), or
        some peculiarity of my system?


Thanks in advance,

Scott.

I have set up ftp-server ftp.fgb.mw.tu-muenchen.de [129.187.200.1].
It mirrors /pub/linux on tsx-11.mit.edu (Thanks to Ted for his help).

There will soon be installed the ftpd from wuarchive.wustl.edu,
that allows downloading subdirectories by creating a tar-file on

Enjoy it,

 now that lp is commonly avail., here's a few notes on installing TeX.

1. get (tsx-11.mit.edu) ptex.tar.Z and either dvips.tar.Z or
dvilj2p.tar.Z (PostSript|LaserJet)

2. see below for default locations. (for dvips, set TEXCONFIG to point
to config.ps and edit config.ps if necessary). the tex binary looks
for the format file tex.fmt which is plain format + the eplain macros
in the .fmt i put in ptex.

Testing:  make test.tex:
             This is a test of \TeX, blah blah
             \bye
run:
   tex test
 to get a DVI file
run:
   dvilj2p -e/dev/lp test
 to print on a laserjet 2p (or better) hanging off /dev/lp.
(dvilj2p.tar.Z has notes on source for other lj)
  or
   dvips test
   cat test.ps >/dev/lp
  for a PostScript printer.
