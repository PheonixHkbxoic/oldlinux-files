Hi, all. I was having trouble compiling ps after applying Linus' and
H.J.'s patches to the .95a kernel. Turned out I hadn't rooted out all
traces of gcc-1.40 --- that part of the FAQ is to be taken very seriously!
Here's H.J.'s message:

        __ctype is from the header files of gcc 1.40. Please backup and remove
        any files related to the previous compilers before you install gcc 2.1.
        There is no __ctype anywhere in the header files for gcc 2.1.
        
        BTW, they are in my FAQ. PLEASE READ IT WORD BY WORD AND FOLLOW THE
        INSTRUCTIONS.
        
        Could you please forward my msg to news groups?

Has anyone had trouble using assert under gcc-2.1? The problem I'm
having (and it only takes a trivial bit of code to demonstrate) is
that while #define-ing NDEBUG turns off assertions as advertised, it
seems that subsequently #undef-ig NDEBUG and re-#include-ing
<assert.h> *fails* to turn them back on.  Am I hallucinating, or is
there really a problem?

Thanks for any assistance,

If you are tired of hitting RETURN and selecting the
same SVGA mode every time you boot Linux, apply this
patch and rebuild the kernel.  It allows you to preset
the mode in the Makefile, so that the setup program
proceeds as if you had hit RETURN and your favorite number.

You can just delete this file.  It would be out of date once you do your
partition editing anyways.  Use "attrib -hr image.idx" to make the file
writable and visible, and then delete it.  Check your autoexec.bat file and
comment out the line that creates this file (probably mirror) until you've
finished re-arranging your disk.  Once you've done your magic, and made sure
that everything is working ok (use NU to write garbage to the last logical 
sector of the new, smaller partition, and then use absolute sector read to
find it and check your math is correct) you can remove the comment.  One
thing in the original message you should know about.  If you've got multiple
DOS partitions, only one of which is bootable, you should know that all
partitions have boot code in them even if it is code that says "Non-system
disk" or something similar.  You'd have to massage the sector count in all
partitions' boot records.

Good luck!

The root image is 1.2 megs because that is the only size that will fit
on both a 1.2 meg 5.25" disk _and_ and 3.5" 1.44 meg disk.  There are
not seperate 3.5" and 5.25" root images.

Subject: Re: Binaries considered harmful
Date: 9 Apr 92 19:38:44 GMT


I'll probably regret this, but here goes...

What's the beef?  I think the discussion about distributing individual
binaries is clouding a more important issue.  It seems pretty clear to
me that linux, just like any Unix, needs a binary distribution to
bootstrap from.  The binary distribution needs to be
        * stable
        * easily downloaded & installed
        * complete(*)
        * as small as practical (say ~5-8 Mb)
This would allow newcomers to install a working system with known
features (& bugs) with a minimum of hassle and ftp/file transfer time.

I'd like to see this system include gcc(**), but that's certainly not
necessary.  From this platform, people could evaluate linux without
spending a couple of weeks moving this file and that patch, etc.  If
successful, they can then add binary accessory packages or source +
patches.  The distribution model used by commercial Unixes is not bad
- it just costs way too much, and you can't get source even if you
want it.

I don't know if Alan's ABC version will do this or not, but I hope
so.  Without a stable C compiler & development system it's probably a
waste of time to try and assemble a distribution, but now I think we
can.

<Joe
==============================
(*) What's complete?  Well, one example comes to mind: the MKS toolkit
is reasonably complete and fits into this size limitation.  Basically
it should have enough functionality to give a good look at Unix and
the capability to load additional packages.  Maybe the Byte benchmarks
would be a reasonable target capability.

(**) What would you do with such a system except software development:
I'm not holding *my* breath for Word Perfect for Linux :-)

OK, there are a few new things at tsx-11.mit.edu

Linus has made available another patch for linux, right after I
finally patched the source to .95c.  This one is called .95c+ (wait,
doesn't the unary operator look like '++'?...) and patches are
available in /pub/linux/patches, source in /pub/linux/source/system,
and bootimage in /pub/linux/images.  All the files have the
appropriate names with .95c+ in them.  Oh, yeah, there's also a
README.0.95c+ in /pub/linux/docs.

Jim Winstead has made available the system-0.95a.tar.Z he promised,
with source to many utilities.  It is in
/pub/linux/sources/system

Jim Lynch has ported kermit 5a, and it is available as
/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/kermit5A.tar.Z
It includes a readme -- read it.

Someone put a file xcomm.tar.Z in incoming, and it has been put in
/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/xcomm.tar.Z
I have not looked at it, and don't know if it belongs elsewhere.  I
don't know what it contains, other than from the name.

Which brings me to this:

NOTE:
Please, when you upload things to tsx-11.mit.edu, send mail describing
it to ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu, so that we know that it's there and
what it is.  Most people have been doing this, but a few haven't, so I
thought I would remind people just in case...

The images I have seem to work without any difficulties for either 1.2MB or
1.44MB disks.  Since (to my understanding) they are raw images, it dosen't
really matter how big the disk is, just as long as the entire thing fits.

That is not totally right. Here again.

I am enclosing a program, conv. You run it under ./linux. That program will ensure only one set of header files is needed for compiling appplications and
kernel.

Before you run it, you have to have gcc 2.1 beta, mv, cp and sed
installed on your system.

Before you do anything, please backup gcc 2.1 and kernel sources. Here
goes.

Step 1: Apply Linus's second patch and then my 2.1kernel.tar.Z.

Step 2: Read conv and understand what it is doing. Then go to the
        toplevel of kernel source tree and do

        conv

Step 3: Edit the toplevel Makefile and add -DPRE_GCC_2 to CFLAGS.
        You have to get rid of "-nostdinc -Ixxxx" stuff since
        ./include has been moved to /usr/include.

Step 4: Type

        make

If you have any problem, please let me know.
