Well, Linux is being distributed under the GNU GPL, and most of its
utilities are the GNU utilities, including the GNU C compiler and the
GNU shell bash.  Other than that, not much.

One big difference between Linux and GNU Hurd is that Linux works now.
In fact, Linux was the first working free Unix to be generally
available.  Hurd can (sort of) boot and be useful, but it's not very
stable at all.  While Linux is hardly commercial production quality,
it's stable enough for a large number of people to do development, which
is simply not true of the other free Unix systems out there.

The big difference between Hurd and Linux is that Hurd is Big.  (At the
very least, it has been Architected Big.)  If you wish, think of Hurd as
GNU Emacs, and think of Linux as /bin/ed or vi.  Seen in this light, it
is hardly surprising that Linux has reached stability first, despite the
fact that the people at GNU have been working on Hurd for longer than
Linus has been working on Linux.

While Hurd will eventually have many more features than Linux, it is not
clear how much disk space or memory will be required to run it.  And for
most people, those extra features may or may not be useful.  Time will
tell.

As for the BSD 386, from what I can tell from other people's reports (I
have not tried running BSD 386 yet myself), Linux is slightly more
stable, but only slightly.  BSD 386 has the advantage that (except for
the 386/AT&T-free modules which were newly written), the majority of it
is vintage code, which should be pretty robust.  It's disadvantages are:
it's big; it doesn't have shared libraries; it wants to take over your
entire hard disk (Linux and DOS can co-exist on the same hard disk; BSD
can not); it doesn't have SCSI drivers (yet).  It's one big, big, big
advantage is: It has networking in the kernel already.  For people with
Ethernet cards, things like FTP at close to 100Kbytes/second and NFS are
very big draws.

I think Linux has a place, but I think the one thing it needs fast is
networking code in the kernel.  (That, and X11 :-) This features will
eventually come, but hopefully it will be sooner rather than later.  Is
anyone working on networking in the kernel right now?  I know there were
a few people interested in it, but I don't know if any of them are still
working on it.

   May I suggest that instead of describing in long and careful detail how
   to fix the failed patch hunks in swap.c, you simply provide a new patch
   file which doesn't fail?  I suspect it would take up less room than your
   description, and would be simpler for most people to do.

I think that providing a description _is_ worthwhile, not because it
fixes this problem, but because it demonstrates the process of
patching, and especially the process of patching by hand, to people
who are not used to patching.  I know that the first time I ever
patched something, I was flying by night.  I was lucky enough to do
things right, but not everyone is.  So anyone who follows these
instructions can provide diffs, and those who want to understand
patching can follow the instructions to learn the process.

Note that the manual project influences my thinking this way :-)

   As to your point about a configuration process, I agree with you.  Linux

Ross Biro has made available a configuration system.  Unfortunately, I
have not had time to look at it, as all my hacking time (non-existent
these past two weeks :-( ) is being spent on scsi for the DTC.

   is rapidly approaching the point where it could really use a
   /usr/etc/config program ala BSD to build its Makefile.  Although I
   haven't had the time in a while to do any kernel hacking in a while
   (unfortunately, sigh....) I will note that the config program is freely
   available in /packages/bsd-sources/usr.sbin/config on ftp.uu.net.
   Perhaps someone would be willing to take a whack at adapting it for
   Linux?  If not, when I manage to find some time I'll look into it.

Everything should be standard, and on boot up should autodetect, and install
if the hardware needed to support it is there.  Yes, this is larger than 
a bare kernel, but one distribution will work for everybody until they
recompile or relink it with the options they want.

Maybe a script file, like Larry Wall's Perl configuration script would 
be easier to use and more flexible, as it could configure Makefiles,
C source and header files transparantly to the end user.

You might take a look at what I did with the configuration files in 
the SCSI driver package - they consolodate all of the configuration
information in one config file, with a CONFIG_DISTRIBUTION that turns
on everything, and defaults that work for most systems.

Just get .95c+, as it has the PS and lp patches already applied,
and they work beautifully.

Note that to correctly compile ps.c, you should make sure that 
the files in /usr/include/linux match those in /usr/src/linux/include/linux, 
and you should remove the -I flag from the Makefile.

Yeah, I have experienced problems at high speeds, too. There is packet
loss when transferring files with kermit, and the modem has an irritating
habit of suddenly dropping off-line, if simultaneous heavy disk activity
occurs. The surest way to effect this is to compile something on another
console (thank God I don't need swap in order to use the compiler!).
I even have a 16550AN UART chip, and it doesn't help at all (does anyone
know, if the serial driver supports 16550 fifos?).

My guess is that something in the kernel disables interrupts for too
long, perhaps its the hard disk driver, perhaps the problem occurs when
forking a new process, I don't know. It's annoying all the same.

As an aside, I've been hearing that it isn't possible to use serial ports
using the same IRQ line simultaneously. Isn't it possible to poll all the
UARTS on the IRQ line in the interrupt handler? Ie. you'd need a slightly
smarter interrupt handler. One routine would handle com1 and com3 and
another one would handle com2 and com4. I've never written an actual serial
driver, so I'm not very sure about this, but I think it ought to be possible.

Has anyone got a working smail 3.1.25 for Linux yet? I managed to
get one compiled with a new machine description file and editing
the EDITME file to suit, and it seems to work - mostly. It
consistently traps _after_ delivering mail to local mailboxes,
otherwise it seems quite function.

I haven't been able to track it down further yet due to gdb not
functioning with the new gcc 2.1 beta + kernel + a.out.h, but I
thought I'd post this just in case the problem is known and
someone's already been though this before. If not, then I'll wait
for an updated gdb.

I'm still using 2.0 (and an older version at that) as I've been too busy
to upgrade.  I doubt the HJ-patch is really needed - I read through it,
and I'd guess 0.95c+ should compile pretty cleanly without it.  Anybody
tried it? HJ's patch also assumes you have a 387, and you'll have to
edit the makefile if you don't. 

I'll have to upgrade my compiler (probably this weekend), and the next
real version should have no problems with 2.1.  I'm in fact still using
my original 1.40 for everything but the kernel - I've left the actual
beta-testing of the new compilers and libraries to everyone else, and
I'll step in now that they seem stable.  Lazyness or prudency, you
decide :)

I compiled .95c first without and the with the HJ patch. There were no
problems either way. Then I moved the kernel includes under /usr/include/linux
with HJ's conv script. I hope this will become "official" practise, since
it makes everything ever so much simpler. How about it, Linus? :)
