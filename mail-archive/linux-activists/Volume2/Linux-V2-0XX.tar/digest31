I applied the 0.95a patches to the 0.95a kernel, corrected the out_b
instruction with exchanged parameters and changed the test to != 255.
I have one printer connected to lp0 and everything works ok.

Now I need a line printer deamon.  I wrote a small deamon with lpd, lpr,
lprm and lpq a few months ago for MINIX.  It is a simple deamon, only made
for one queue.  I am not familiar with real UNIX printer deamons, I know
how to use lpr, lpq and lprm, that's all.

My deamon will be started by lpr and then runs until the queue is empty.
When there is nothing to print, no deamon runs and no resources are
wasted.  It supports multiple kinds of paper, because I sometimes change
between single sheets and endless paper.  It has no priority classes, no
net interface, no printcap, no multiple queues with job scheduling or
things like that.

-  Would you prefer a standard system V deamon?
-  Do you think a Linux specific deamon with special support for typical
   PC problems (multiple kinds of paper etc.) may be better?
-  I don't know how printcap works, I only know it is a termcap like
   database for printer capabilities.  Do you think it is useful, do you
   use it and can you give me more informations about it?
-  I thought about running the spool files through compress, the printer
   is so slow, that uncompressing should not need much CPU power.  Any
   comments?
-  My lpr does not know any filter options.  Do you consider them to be
   useful?  Any suggestions, standards on how to implement them?
-  My lpr does not change the incoming data in any way, no \n to \r\n
   expansion, no tab expansion, no line break after a fixed number of
   characters etc. Ok?

I set the \n -> \r\n menu entry on my printer, so I can print usual text
files without converting them.

I am waiting for your suggestions, what would you appreciate to see in a
line printer deamon package?

-  Where should the swap file/partition be?  I saw /swap, but personally,
   I would appreciate /dev/swap for various reasons.

-  If there is more than one device which should be mounted temporarily,
   /mnt is not enough.  I recently saw /mnt/exch0, /mnt/exch1 ...

-  I don't like the various links of gcc, cc, gas, as, gcc-as etc.  gcc is
   the system compiler, why not just using cc, as, ld and putting cc1 in
   /usr/lib?  Concerning cpp, I am not sure.  I am used to see it in either
   /lib or /usr/lib, but never in /usr/bin.  But then again, I think it is
   very different to e.g. cc1 in meaning of being an internal compiler pass.
   Many programs use it as usual command, so /usr/bin might be better.

-  The floppy devices: Why not using the MINIX naming conventions?  /dev/at0
   would be /dev/fd0-dshd5in, /dev/PS1 would be /dev/fd1-dshd3in.  I can
   post the complete MINIX floppy names, but I think not all of them are
   implemented in Linux.

Any comments?

Your Guide is very well done.  Following are some notes I made

=======================
}Neat, huh? And this is where 'cat' gets its' name; cancatenate,
                                                     ^-->o

}You can only use 'cat' to list the contents of text files. It won't
}work on 'binary' (executable) files.

Suggest you omit this sentence, since 'cat' is perfectly general,
and since 'binary' is not the same as 'executable'.

}'head' reads to stdout the first 5 lines of a text file. Perhaps
                                  ^-->10

I don't think printenv is bash internal.  (By the way, you might mention
some bash internal commands -- especially 'help'.)

MASM and TASM talks about short, near and far jumps, where a 
short jump is +/- 128 (could be +130/-126...) bytes, a near jump
is within the current code segment (reload ip only), and a far
jump is anywhere in address space (reload cs too).

Ordinarily, you don't specify what sort of jump you want, so
        JMP foo
becames a short, near, or far jump depending on how far away
the label foo is (the shortest one that will reach, is picked).
If you want to defeat this feature you write one of
        JMP short foo
        JMP near foo
        JMP far foo
which will assemble correctly, or complain if stretched too far.

Debuggers (DOS debug, Turbo Debugger) usually give the fully
qualified op-code to tell the user exactly what sort of jump it
is.

a shift key (84-key keyboards do not have separate cursor

Hmmm...I may have to back down on my statement.  I keep breaking through
what appears to be brick walls (afterwards they look like paper though),
only to find another brick wall in front of me!

This time it is the fact that DJGPP is adding 0x1020 to all my data
addresses.  Not necessarily a problem for DJGPP because it expects
to load all its programs with GO32 which sets up a data segment
some magical way such that you need to add that number to all
the addresses!  This is based on an examination of head.s only--
I have no idea what assumptions it's making in the C code!

Anyway, I am slowly becoming convinced that it will be a major
uphill battle to recompile Linux in DOS.  I think the Minix
compiler is probably required.

I'll keep plugging away at it, but I'm not so optimistic any more.

Here's a patch to apply after Linus's recent patches, but first the
reason behind it:

The following patches seem to do the trick for me - they are the
result of following the ps-0.95 installation instructions posted by
eonu24@castle.ed.ac.uk (I Reid).  (I don't consider myself to be a
kernel hacker - so buyer beware.)
