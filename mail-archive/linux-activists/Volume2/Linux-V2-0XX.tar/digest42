   why do most items in the Linux Digests appear twice?

Articles are appearing twice in the Linux Digest because of a bug in C
News which does not handle aliased groups correctly.  (I currently have
in my aliases file: "alt.os.linux 0000002200 02083 =comp.os.linux"; this
will not last long.)

It's been enough time since comp.os.linux has been created.  I propose
we rmgroup alt.os.linux, since all sites which have alt.os.linux should
have created comp.os.linux by now.  Any objections?

I just installed gcc 2.1 and much to my chagrin can't get it to work.
I followed the instructions: removed all vestiges of 1.4, detarred, and
ran the script.  But when I try to compile a simple test program I
get an error from ld that crt0.o is missing from /usr/lib/shared.  And 
indeed that link is missing. If I run gcc with the -static switch an
executable is created but it will not run.

Does anyone have a guess what I might have done wrong?

Date: Wed, 8 Apr 92 03:15:48 GMT

Hi,

I was told that the header files of gcc 2.1 and kernel are quite
confusing. Here is my solution. I am enclosing a program, conv. That
program will ensure only one set of header files is needed for
compiling both applications and kernel.

Before you run it, you have to have gcc 2.1 beta, mv, mvdir, rm and
tar installed on your system.

Before you do anything, please backup gcc 2.1 and kernel sources. Here
goes.

Step 1: Apply Linus's second patch and then my 2.1kernel.tar.Z.

Step 2: Read conv and understand what it is doing. Then go to the
        toplevel of kernel source tree and do

        conv

Step 3: Edit the toplevel Makefile and add -DPRE_GCC_2 to CFLAGS.
        You may also want to get rid of "-nostdinc -Ixxxx" stuff since
        ./include has been moved to /usr/include.

Step 4: Type

        make

I ran into the same problem.  To solve it I made /usr/include/linux 
subdirectory and linked all the stuff in the /usr/src/linux/include into it.

An odd one I ran into was when compiling ps095 it wouldn't accept some of
the include files, saying undeclared __(name).h in _text.  I ended up
putting a full path name to the that particular include file.

Well, on a 386/25, no cache, Linux *feels* as fast as my Mach386 486/33C,
in serous processing the 486 blows away the 386 of course, but Linux has
a distinctly snappier OS response than Mach386.  Same is true for SCO Open
DeathTop.  I can definately report that on a 386/25, Linux outruns DeathTop
significantly.  I'd guess that in the sense of operating system spped, Linux
will perform much better than any of the "big name" Unixes available for
the {3,4}86.  They're not written right down on the hardware, and most of them
are bloated SVR4 beasts anyhow.  (I do like Mach386 though, it's Mach+BSD4.3)

Keep adding features to Linux, surely, but keep the core small and stream-
lined.  If things can stay small while adding networking and such, Linux
has the potential for being a real alternative for those who want extra
performance and don't require a megalithic company behind their OS.

Just as a sidenote.  I just upgraded to 0.95a (I've got the patches to c,
just havn't doen them yet) from 0.12, and while I was impressed with 0.12,
I'm *very* impressed with 0.95a!  My thanks to everybody who's been
contributing to the effort, and my profound respect to Linus for getting this
to this point in just a year!

Very strange. Is inst2.x broken? At least, I can install it. Please do
a

        sh -v inst2.x

There should be symbolic link from /usr/shared/lib/crt0.o to

I agree completely.  However, with the number of patches being
applied, and with the problems with the old kernel/new GCC, the
implentation of VFS, and printer support (Linus promised! :), I think
a new release may be just around the corner.  I'm not one to make
predictions, however....

>Also, am I the only one to have trouble with serial port lock-up
>when you try to use either both odd or both even ports?(2&4, or 1&3)?

This is because (most of the time) ports 1/3 share one IRQ, and ports
2/4 share another.  This is because nobody standardized on something
else when it would have been intelligent to do so.  As a result, you
can't use two devices on 1/3 or 2/4 without colliding.

To work around this, you might be able to set 3 or 4 to different IRQs
- there's usually a jumper on the serial card, if this is possible.
In that case, you'd have to make a couple of small (I think) kernel
patches, and you should be able to use more than 3 devices.  I haven't
tested this, yet, because I haven't had time, but I'll get around to
doing this in the future so I can use my other serial port.  :)

>(i think the RING message is interfering with normal login)

I think sending the modem an "atv0" or something along those lines
should keep it from reporting messages.  Look in your modem manual.

Which bug?  The only thing I've noticed about kermit is it doesn't
support 38400.  The terminal emulation problems are in the VC
drivers....

The root disk is *very* tight, and I'd still like to squeeze an editor
on it.  being able to tar/compress more utilties would be nice, but so
many of them are integral to installing a filesystem.  Shared
libraries may free up a bit of room, but I haven't tried putting
together a root disk like that, yet.

Especially (but not limited to) hlu and zorst, who are porting what
are arguably two of the biggest and most important packages for
Linux's future - GCC and X.  I've got GCC on the disk, just waiting to
be installed, and I can't wait for X.  Teach those OS/2 weenies a
thing or two.

I don't know of anyone with tape drives working.  Apparently the SCSI
patches are able to handle SCSI tape drives, but I haven't heard of
anyone using them.

  I found when I had the same error, an unresolved external for "_ctype"
the compiler couldn't find the include file ctype.h.  I ended up having to
