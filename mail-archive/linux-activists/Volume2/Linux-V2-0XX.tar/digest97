This is a FAQ - the mount programs use a lock file, /etc/mtab~  - so no
one tries to access the /etc/mtab file at the same time.  Delete this,
or better yet put 

rm -f /etc/mtab~

in your /etc/rc.

There is an alpha test version of Geoff Kuenning's ispell V3.0 for "proper"
(i.e. Australian/British) english available for ftp in pub/linux/ispell
at archsci.arch.su.oz.au (129.78.66.1).

There are 3 files:

  README.ispell  - brief installation instructions
  ispell.tar.Z   - tar file that should drop the various files into the
                   appropriate directories if untarred in / directory.
                 - includes man, info, el and elc files
                 - has the medium sized directory recommended by Geoff
  ispell.texinfo - texinfo source for using ispell in emacs

As soon as I get time I will build and make available American English
and German dictionaries.

Ok, I have 2 linux machines:
1:  386-33 4MB 100MB as 50Mb root, 30MB/pub 20MB swap
2:  386-16sx laptop 8MB 40MB 20MB root, 20MB DOS/Stacker(approx 40MB tot.)

I want to bring the laptop home, and use null modem cable(for now, maybe ethernet
later) to connect them, and share resources(diskspace, printers, modems...)
I would specifically like to mount the laptop's hd as /laptop, and use it's
internal modem, as well as mount my root as /desktop on the laptop so
it can use my modem and printers.  also, I have a dumb dos box, and I 
would like to use the desktop as a file/print/comm server.
(if this is currently impossible, let me know, otherwise I need to know
EXACTLY what I need to do this, as I only have e-mail ftpmail access.
)
Thanks in advance,

   If you're getting one block per rotation, that means that the system
   can't keep up with the rotation speed of the disk.  This is not at all
   unusual.  Classically what you do is arrange the files on disk using
   every other block or every third block, or whatever you need in order
   that the system can keep up.  

We could certainly do that, although I think it would be more profitable
to try speeding up the hard disk driver; and only if that doesn't work,
then start mucking with block allocation algorithm for the filesystem.

(BTW, a very simple change to the block allocation algorithm for the
Minix fs would be to pass it the location of the previous block in the
file, and for it to try to allocate a block in the same "zone".  If
there is no previous block, it should allocate a block in the zone with
the highest amount of free space, to spread out the allocated blocks
around.  Such a change would give you a large part of the speed
advantages of the Berkeley FFS, with relatively little work.  Of course,
it still wouldn't give you long filenames...)

In any case, there are two things about the current hard disk driver
which hopefully should be fixed.  (1) It doesn't use DMA.  This may or
may not be fixable; I'd need to do some research about the low-level
interface before I could answer that.  (2)  It doesn't coallesce
multiple block read requests over a single track into a single request.
Fixing this should significantly speed up the speed of non-caching IDE
drives, especially combined with the look-ahead which the filesystem is
already doing.

What does a "character set based graphics system" mean?
If it means you want something like what a vt220 gives you,
or perhaps some other terminal, wouldn't the better route be to
take the vt100 stuff and enhance it?

Direct screen writing stuff may be interesting and even necessary
on dumb 4.77 Mhz machines, but for more powerful machines, I think
it attaches too much hardware dependance to the application.

Can you not achieve what you want doing it the Terminfo/Termcap way?

P.S. I presume Linux uses Terminfo, right?

Amazing discovery with NCS version of AMI BIOS.  C-A-D has never worked

Linux alter the timer chips such that the keyboard thinks 250msec has

I have been watching the newsgroup for a few days, but haven't seen any
FAQ, or anything to do with IBM MicroChannel.

Is there anyone working on an MCA version of linux?  If so, I would like

A few questions. I just got Linux running under a partition on my 386-25.
My primary partition, C:, is running DOS, which is how this message is 
coming to you :) (I am using Waffle-DOS for uucp).
 
Anyway, D: and E: are Linux filesys and swap, respectively. (swap is 4m).
 
I would like to know how to do the following:

1) Does Linux have *any* working mail program? I can't seem to find any.
2) How do I transfer my news and mail feeds over to Linux (I'd first need
   a mail program, of course, plus readnews and uucp).
3) Where can I get troff/groff/nroff for Linux? (or at least workable).
 
Thanks!

This is caused by sys/param.h #defining HZ whilst curses.h tries to
use it as a variable.  A temporary hack is to add "#define HZ HZ" before
you include curses.h.

both the boot sector on the Dos partition (which I expected it to do),

Well, there are patches to add mmap/munmap system calls to linux. Other patches
exist to access i/o ports, to switch to various VGA modes. Unfortunately, these
are not coordinated and no docs. Using these I can switch to graphic modes and
write to the screen. I never got a consistant result, with random appearing
pixels on the screen. I understand that 256-color modes are easier to write to.
One missing addition is code for bank-switching. The code that comes with djgpp
graphics libraries could be cannibalized to achieve this purpose.

I know that several people are working on graphics support, but none are sharing
much of their efforts or results (no flames intended).

Two weeks in the Maui sun, and some half baked ideas are now fully broiled.
Here they are, in no particular order.
 
I note BSDI is promising binary compatibility with SysV 3.2.  I imagine
then that if this happens, 386BSD will eventually follow suit if possible.  
Soooo, anyone know if there are any steps that could be taken to move Linux
part way towards it now?  Like perhaps, adopting the same system call
interface, if possible?   I know that the current shared libraries
interface is incompatible with that goal, but ignore that for the moment.
The primary issue here is to strengthen Unix vis-a-vis other commercial
operating systems.

BTW:  has anyone tried the OLEO spreadsheet on tsx yet.  Bug reports or
"it works for me" reports would be appreciated.  

Is anyone working on a fully automated install program like the one
for SUN and DELL?

I would like to see a layered installation available with perhaps the 
following options:
        1) Just the runtime system
        2) Development (includes, kernel source, compiler, yacc, etc)
        3) X-windows runtime.
        4) X-windows development.

This would hit most of the interest groups, while remembering the
frugel (space conscious) nature that draws us all to systems like Linux.

Howdy,

I finally got C-news to work well enough to read and post news!  
Unfortunately, the dbz routines are still screwing up - so the active
file is always growing longer rather than being overwritten.

If someone out there has this working flawlessly, PLEASE tell me what
else I have to do to it.  I also found that newsbin/inject/tear didn't
work as distributed -- this may be a problem with awk or with my shell.

I found out the extremely hard way that linux or gnu thinks that fseek() 
should return the new offset if sucessful, rather than zero, like all
other stdio's appear to.  Is this some new ANSI thing, or is libc screwed 
up?

Also strcasecmp() is the same as strcmp().  I got the gcc2.1 distribution
from tsx-11 somewhere around April 4 -- is there a newer version that
has corrected these things?

Yes. Right. I have a broken 40M disk, and when you power down, it still
discharges a capacitor through the voice coil, which jams the head
behind a latch. (wouldn't autoparking be hard for stepper motor controlled
