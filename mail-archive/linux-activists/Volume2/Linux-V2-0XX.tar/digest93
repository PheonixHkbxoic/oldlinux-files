During upgrading linux to 0.95c+/gcc2.1 beta I discovered a bug in the
file system regarding hard links. Someone who knows the minix fs code
might like to take a look at this before 0.96 is released.

Ok, do a fsck -r and clear any errors (I tend to get quite a few unused
but marked zones after only a few hours of kernel recompilations, there
are clearly other problems in the fs other than the one I will describe, the
moral is use fsck regularly or run out of disk space !)

1) create 'afile' with some text in it, doesn't matter what.

2) ln afile bfile

3) create 'cfile' again with something in.

4) mv cfile afile

if you now do an ls -l bfile you will see that it still reports two links.
Run fsck again (not -r yet!) and you should see
Inode x, i_nlinks=2,counted=1
Now this is obviously wrong, the link count on bfile should be 1 not 2.

5) rm bfile

bfile now gets removed from the directory, but its inode and zones haven't
been released as the fs still thinks there is another link to it. Running
fsck gives
Inode x not used,marked in bitmap
Inode x i_nlinks=1,counted=0
Zone x: marked in use, no file uses it

At this point I thought this was a general problem with the rename system
call and this was the source of all the marked but unused zones that keep
cropping up, however I had never seen the Inode messages before. It turns
out that moving over a file with no other links, i.e. i_nlinks=1, works fine.

I took a quick look at fs/minix/rename.c to see if I could spot an error,
but from what I can see it looks alright there is an ->i_nlinks-- done
on one of the inodes it works with. I shall investigate futher when I have
the time but I think it would be better if someone who was familiar with
the code looked at it (its a bit messy) so that it might get fixed in the
next release.

Cheers,
Stephen

Yes, something is not.  I set the clock and the date with the new
programs 'clock' and 'date', and it seemed to work ok.  'date' did
mention the time zone (HST, -10 from GMT).  But at the next reboot,
the 'clock -s' I had put in /etc/rc didn't set the date and gave
an error message that I probably wasn't root.  I was root, but 'clock'
was suid bin and /dev/port was owned by bin.  I had to change 'clock'
to suid root to get it to work.  Time passed.  After the next reboot
and 'clock -s' executed from /etc/rc, 'clock' said it was
        Sun 4/21 15:21, but 'date' claimed it was
        Tue 4/21 05:21.  It was actually Tue 4/21 15:21.  So I did
another 'clock -s', and then I got
        Sun 4/21 15:22 from 'clock', and
        Tue 4/21 15:22 from 'date'.  That's correct, except 'clock'
still displays the wrong day-of-week.  After 'clock -w', 'clock' and
'date' finally both displayed the correct date and time.  Whew.

Linus has put a pre-release for .96 on tsx-11, and it is available as
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/system/pre-0.96.tar.Z
and

Compress starts to use memrory that it hasn't allocated when it gets
invalid input. Most unices will then give it a "segment violation" and
kill it. Linux currently simply allocates the memory, and lets the 
application continue. This will be fixed in the future. (if nobody
else does it, I will.)

 29)  Linux mkfs doesn't accept the size I give the device,
although I double-checked with fdisk, and it's correct.
 30)  I have a one partitionned 40Mb disk. If I run mkfs, what
happens?

 42)  When I try to (un)compress many files in one command, the
command partially fails?

 62)  What are the editors available in linux?
 63)  Does there exist a printer package for Linux?
 64)  Does there exist a ps for Linux?

moving around, why?
 86)  How can I get Linux to boot directly from the harddisk?

save a file; what can I do?
 96)  I have an SVGA, but Linux detect an EGAc/EGAm; is it normal?
 97)  How can I change the keyboard repeat rate?

IX. GCC MISC INFORMATION
========================
 98)  I don't know how to install gcc stuff, is there special
places?
 99)  I seem to be unable to compile anything with gcc. Why?
100)  I'm using a program that uses signal handlers which are
installed using sigaction() with the SA_NOMASK, and they get a general
protection error right after the signal handler tries to return.
What's going wrong?
101)  gcc complains about not finding crt0.o and the system
include files What am I doing wrong ?
102)  While compiling some GNU packages gcc chokes on regex.c with
an insn code, what can I do?
103)  I tried to port a /new/ version of gnu stuff. But in the
