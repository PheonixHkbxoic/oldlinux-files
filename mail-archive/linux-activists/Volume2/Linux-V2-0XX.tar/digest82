Date: Fri, 17 Apr 1992 22:15:46 GMT

        My roommate has recently been playing with linux on his laptop and I 
was thinking about setting up a drive with linux on it myself. The system I 
would be setting it up on is a Gateway 2000 486/33 ISA.  My main hard drive is 
an ESDI drive on an Ultrastor controller.  I have a second Seagate SCSI ST-02 
controller connected to a Syquest 44MB removable drive.  I was thinking about 
setting up a syquest cartridge and a boot floppy which would be my linux setup 
on this computer.  Would it be possible to setup the bootdisk so it didn't
bother with the ESDI drive and only looked at the SCSI drive?  Would there
be any problem using the Syquest drive even though I wouldn't be changing 
disks?

        Thanks,

Are man pages available for any of the gnu utilities?  

Also, a good editor to import to linux might be 'elle', the
emacs-like editor supplied with MWC COHERENT.  Might be suitable
for the distribution as it's small.

Also, there is a PD Basic-interpreter out there called Phil's Basic,

I have a couple of questions about Linux. First, kermit does not work.
It runs fine at first but it cannot even "connect". It times out after
issuing the command "connect" with the message "cannot get char:
EAGAIN", or something like that. Does that happen to everybody? I'm not
using kermit5A by the way (that one terminates with a segmentation
fault). xc runs fine. I have a hayes-compatible modem at com1 (ttys1).
Also, zmodem (rz) does not work. It also times out. Any suggestions
would be greatly apprecuated. I've been using mskermit and zmodem
under DOS for quite some time with no problems. 

Second, how can I setup a user account other than root? -- i.e. how to
setup the /etc/passwd file, .. etc? Thank you.

1.  Is this the .95c+ Image?  Early versions are missing Adaptec 
        Support.

>0 host adapters detected

^^^^

The SCSI kernel is only known to work with 1542 adapters (And Ultrastor
14F's, and Seagates), but I don't know about the 17xx series.  Your 
SCSI host wasn't even detected - but if the 17xx series uses the 
same chip as the 1540 series, it would just be a signature problem
on detection.  To fix it, you need a rebuilt kernel that will detect 
the 17xx board, assuming it is Adaptec 1542 compatable, and 
"Do the right thing."
 

>detected 0 disks , 0 tapes

This is covered in the FAQ - and although not your only problem (see 
above) can be rectified by changing the bytes at offset 508 and 
509 to 0.

If it will work on your system out of the box, the SCSI binary 
(vmunix.Z on headrest.woz.colorado.edu, something else 
on other sites), will work.  Source is provided to the entire
SCSI package, like the rest of the Linux kernel.

There is a separate FAQ for SCSI, I should probably get everything
organized and get it in the "official" FAQ.

Get the SCSI boot image, and change the bytes at offset 0508 and 0509 to
00 00.  Linux will completely ignore the ESDI disk, and other than 
it showing up when you run fdisk, nothing will happen.

Nope.  Don't change the cartridge after booting though.

I still haven't got Linux to load rootimage diskette if I'm
using 1.44Mb diskettes. (I have tried on four different 
machines: 3*486/33 + 1*386SX/20.)

However, yesterday I tried Linux on two machines with 1.2Mb
5.25" floppy drives and everything worked fine. Both were
386SX machines with 2Mb RAM and Phoenix BIOS.

Maby rawrite doens't work correctly with 1.44Mb floppies
on my machine? I will try to switch floppy drive cables
and boot from 5.25" drive. If it works, fine. But it is
only temporary solution since OS/2 2.0 wants to install
from 3.5" floppy drive. (Well, maby 5.25" diskettes for
OS/2 exist, but I don't want to use them.)

   I stand corrected.  In general, however, the problem is that if the functions are
   not statically bound to offsets at the call site, dynamic linking either requires
   (1) another level of indirection or (2) a fixup at the call site. Solution (1)
   can be made more efficient if supported in hardware, and solution
   (2) requires impure code.  In general, both these solutions have real performance
   drawbacks.  In case (2) pointers to functions have to be handled as well.

Yes indeed.  PRIMOS (and many other OSes) used (2).  But I don't know for
sure how serious the performance drawbacks are; again, weighing shareability
and revisability against run-time and hardware-design issues is difficult,
because these issues are very deep and dense (they go all the way down to
issues like "how should the TLB work" and "how should cache work" and all the
way up to "how should programmers work" :-).

   Segmentation is related issue.  Segments can provide the extra level of
   indirection for dynamic linking, handles for memory management etc, not
   to mention other advantages.  The segment sizes are the issue ('286 and '386).
   Too few large segments are not good for small blocks or functions, too many
   small ones and you can't allocate large arrays.  The good and the bad... life.

Yes, I don't think segments are really useful in today's world unless they are
both numerous and large, as appears to be the case with the 486 (and
apparently not with the 386, certainly not with the 286).

   The model for Unix has been flat memory, sharing by pages and basically
   KISS.  I'm all for experimentation though.  My feeling is the proof is in the
   pudding.  Build it.  If it works, everyone will use it.

Absolutely.  We have much work to do in the flat-model world just to get
software up and running; for now, I think we should reserve the issues of
segmentations to "what-if" just to keep our minds open to what might happen
in the future and how we might improve performance down the road.  Also to
keep us from making decisions that'll seem foolish sometime in the future.

So probably somebody can help.

I'd like to use slip for that purpose. KA9Q does it on the linux

Maybe someone who knows "pfdisk" can help me out here...
I'm trying to create a partition for linux in the location
of the second logical partition on the extended partition. (Linux
recognizes this as /dev/hda6). Problem is, pfdisk can only
set partitions 1 to 4 -- not up to 6. Perhaps I'm using it wrong,
in which case I'd appreciate if someone would explain 
how pfdisk is supposed to function, and what, if any, differences
it has from the msdos fdisk program.

The REASON for all of this is: I have a linux setup on the above
partition (that I created with dos's fdisk) and I've got my 
filesystem installed on it. I've been TRYING to set up 
Shoelace, (following the summarized directions that were posted 
here yesterday) and the winiboot program comes up fine and offers
my selections to me (1 and 2 are the only valid selections that it
offers me since 3 & 4 are zeroed out). If I select '1', DOS boots (as
it's supposed to). If I select '2', the system locks with a message
"NO ROM BASIC
 SYSTEM HALTED"
 So...after trying several things, I came up with the thought that 
 perhaps the partition that I was attempting to 
 "laceup /dev/hda6 wini" needed to be a Linux (Minix 1.5+?) 
 compatible partition. If this ISN'T the problem, could someone
 tell me what I COULD be doing wrong? Note that I followed the 
 directions posted here on the 17th exactly. The "boot" line
 of the config file is set to "/lboot" (my patched boot image
 that starts Linux just fine from floppy and goes on to the file 
 system on the hard drive).

 Thanks...

A question to the Linux users and developers: Do you intend to keep on
using Linux, and developing more and more features for it, even when
386BSD or the GNU OS (Mach+HURD) evetually are as stable as Linux is
now? Is the intention to keep Linux "small and simple," and not
implement many non-POSIX features?  Presumably Mach+HURD will demand
much more RAM to run comfortably, for instance?

I guess at least Berkeley sockets and TCP/IP are already in the
process of being ported to Linux, and somebody is probably porting the
BSD file system, etc.  What will then be the difference between Linux
and 386BSD?  Linux' innermost kernel was written from scratch directly
for the 386, does this mean Linux will always be noticeably faster?

Try getting a copy of boot_b.exe.  It will write a new boot sector to a
floppy disk that will boot your B drive, so you could have a 3.5 in A
that has been boot_b'ed, and then the linux boot disks in the 5.25
drive.  It think that it can be found in either the sysutl or dskutl
directories on the msdos tree of simtel (or wuarchive).

I'm packing Linux on a Unix box to diskettes to be transported to a
DOS machine on which I'd like to test Linux on.  I'm using the stuff
from /pub/OS/Linux on nic.funet.fi, and it seems to be easy enough to
pack the things to the diskettes.

However, I didn't find anywhere documented what binaries and files are
on the root image diskette.  I think it would be nice to list what
stuff is on the root image so people would know what other stuff they
need to install at the beginning.  It would also be nice to have a
list of programs which are needed for which things (eg. "for
rebuilding the kernel you'll need gcc*.tar.Z, kernel***.tar.Z, etc.).

Sorry if I've just overlooked something, I'm in a bit of a hurry to
copy the disks.
