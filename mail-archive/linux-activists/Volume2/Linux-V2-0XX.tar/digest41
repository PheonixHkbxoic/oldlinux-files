Tommy Thorn's driver has been incorporated into the latest 
release of the SCSI drivers, which I will put up RSN.
What the people on the SCSI mailing list got  :
 
---
Ok, here's the deal :
1.  I found a clash between the seagate driver and 
        gcc2.x, which has been rectified.  Basically, gcc2 decided 
        "Gee, it would be good to save bx and si."  This changed 
        the stack frame around, moving things by 8 bytes,
        the assembler code used the 
        old version of the stack frame, things got corrupted and 
        may or may not have worked correctly.  

        The binaries were compiled with gcc1.37? for 
        the SCSI stuff, 2.x for the rest of it, so this 
        should only have been a problem for those 
        recompiling the whole mess.

        Of course, since bx and si were being changed,
        and not preserved as gcc may have expected them
        to be, this could also have caused problems.

        
2.  I have a damaged directory under my source tree, and need 
        to finish fixing fsck to repair it.  This takes
        priority over getting out binaries + sources, as 
        I can't get the former out if I don't do a build,
        and won't send out the later without testing them
        first.  

After the second problem is rectified, and Linus's new patches are 
applied, new distributions will be put out including tthorn's 
adaptec drivers.

With Minix FS, yes.  

This is what VFS takes care of - it provides an interface
between file related system calls (ie open, read, etc), 
and different file systems such as the Minix FS, Berkely
FFS, LFS, Tar FS, FTP FS, let your imagination run wild.....

It also requires an entire hard disk to itself, and has no 387 
emulation in the kernel, which makes using stock compilers....
tricky.

I was trying to compile my much beloved version of uEmacs 3.8, (I've made

This is an excellent idea. Also, I keep hearing about "Linus's second
patch" but I never hear it referred to by its specific file name. Is
this the 0.95c.patch.1 that is on tsx?

BTW, great work on GCC 2.1.

   I have an IDE "paddle card" controller as my primary controller and a
Seagate ST-22M as my secondary controller.  The BIOS on the ST-22M works
very nicely with the IDE card as long as (1) the ST-22M is set up using the
secondary address (0x170), and (2) the second CMOS drive type is set to 0
(not installed).  I run DOS this way regularly;  I recently put SCO Unix on
the MFM drive, set the first CMOS Drive type to 0 and the second CMOS type
to match the MFM drive, and was able to boot unix (just by changing CMOS).
I paid about $54 for the ST-22M, which also has a floppy controller;  the
ST-21M (without floppy controller) should cost less.

My apologies to anyone who had problems with drives following my posting and

When I wrote that bit I did an ls -l /dev on my Linux setup to get the device

Subject: Large disk partition
Date: 7 Apr 92 20:22:08 GMT

Is it possible for Linux to use a disk partition greater than 64Mb ?
I have a 650Mb disk at 1283x16x63.  DOS takes up the first 1023 clinders
(the most it can have), leaving me 128Mb as a second partition.  But when I
try mkfs it moans for greater than 64Mb :-(

So I now have 64Mb of unused disk (and unusable!  Stupid idea of BIOS boot to
have each partition starting before cylinder 1024.  means my last partition
MUST be at least 128Mb).

Alternatively, could I make this into an extended partiton, with 2x64Mb
in that, or even 1x10Mb (root+tmp), 1x12Mb(swap=3xRAM),1x64 (/usr), 1x42 (think
of something!).

If so, how?  I've read the begineers guide, and the FAQ (Mar 29th) mentions
hda5 as extended partition with a warning, but I couldn't find any info
on how to create this extended partition (NOTE: Dos fdisk won't do it because
it is above the 1024 cylinder limit), nor how to make this as root partition.

Help please!  I am on 0.95c (yippeee! I successfully managed to get Linus's
patches to work! Well the kernel boots :-) ).

Thanks in advance.

I agree that the patches for .95c should be put on the ftp sites.

I mean: It would be nice to ftp the 95c bootimage(maybe with lp
patch?) anyone else agree?
Anyway, How _does_ one go about login via modem?

Also, am I the only one to have trouble with serial port lock-up
when you try to use either both odd or both even ports?(2&4, or 1&3)?
I can use 1&2, 2&3,but not 1&3, 2&4  I have three regular com ports,
and an internal everex 1200 baud modem on 4.  I have yet to get the
internal to work on 4. :(  (no real loss, 1200 is slow anyway)
I have an xt for dos stuff, so my 386 is dedicated to Linux

I would ideally like to login to linux via modem(2400 on ttys2) and
initiate a kermit session to my xt(2400 on ttys1 null modem), however,
I can't seem to login via my modem.  I have used getty 19200 ttys1 &
to login directly from the xt, but getty 2400 ttys2 & always gives
problems(i think the RING message is interfering with normal login)
anyway, any ideas, etc... please e-mail to jgifford@attmail.com
(I have logged in at 19200 on ttys1, run kermit out ttys2 to modem, to
connect to e-mail(the pc has a log to disk feature I can't re-create
on Linux with kermit))
also, does anyone know if kermit on tsx-11 still has the bug?

While I am at it...
      1)Kudos to Linus!!!!! GREAT JOB!!!!! (I once was crazy enough
        to try to write a *nix clone, gave up though)
      2)Kudos to Jim Winstead for making an easy install procedure
        suggestion: tar and compress some of the utilities and bash
        and see if they might fit on a root image(worth a try?)
        Also, thanks for being such a help to new-to-linux folks
      3)Kudos to Chuck Boyer for writing the much needed owners
        manual/installation manual/intro to Linux manual....
      4)Kudos to I Reid for a comprehensive explanation of booting linux
        off the hard drive(just when I most needed it :> ) 
      5)Kudos to all the people porting software to Linux, without which
        we would have to do it all ourselves.  :)
      6)Kudos to anyone I have left out. 
Linux is the fastest implementation of *nix on [3,4]86 I have seen yet!

If anyone is interested:

          3 is empty(obviously)

        ttys4:internal 1200 everex modem(not working for some reason)
        PS0 and at1 installed

Oh, one other question: has anyone got a tape drive functioning under Linux?
I am considering that as my next purchase, and I am wondering what is best
for Linux?

Thanks, sorry for all the questions.....
