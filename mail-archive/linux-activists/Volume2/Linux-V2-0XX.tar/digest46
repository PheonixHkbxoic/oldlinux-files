   *** Now.  What the F*** do I _need_ to get a reasonable Linux system up and
   running ?   The last time I tried to actually figure it out, (back at 0.12)
   I just FTP'ed the whole directory.  Untarred the whole bundle.  Hoped
   everything fell into place when I  unTar'ed from "/".   

   Although you (Theodore) probably have a biased view, I think even you have
   to admit that the binaries directory is a bit ... cluttered?

Yes, it is a bit cluttered, but what's essential to one person will be
trash to another.  I consider mtools essential; other people consider it
a complete waste of time.  Who's to say?  Furthermore, I don't have time
to pass judgement on each file and determine whether it's essential or
not.  Sometimes I don't even have a chance to make sure the binary is
working before I install it in the directory.

However, Alan Clegg has been working on the ABC release, which should
fix a lot of these complaints people have been having.  It will not
necessarily contain the latest stuff, but it will contain something
that's stable.  Unfortunately, he's been busy with work, and so it will
be a while before it will be released.  Patience!

I will repeat the wry comment which someone else has made.  If "we" did
all the work that had been proposed be done by "we", Linux would be
ahead of BSD 4.4 by now.  :-)

Subject: Seagate SCSI *almost* working...
Date: 9 Apr 92 04:27:03 GMT

I've been using linux now for a couple of months, and I decided to
try and get an old seagate st-277n I had laying around working
with it.  I got an ST-01 controller, and ftp'd the linux95a
scsi patches from headreset.colorado.edu.  Hacked them into
my Linux .95c system.  Had to make one small change to
seagate.c, as my signature "SEAGATE SCSI BIOS REVISION"
is at offset 17 rather than the 16 indicated in the file.
Upon bootup, the system does find the host adapter, and 1
scsi disk (yay!).  Where do I go from here?  I get several
messages here, but I don't know if they are normal or not.
and how do I partition the drive?  Here is what I see:

...
1 host adapters detected
Detected scsi disk at host 0, ID 0, lun 0
Detected 1 disks, 0 tapes total
Warning: SCSI device at host 0, id 0, lun 0 failed READ CAPACITY
status=5345c
Sense not available
Block size assumed to be 512 bytes, disk size 1 GB
Cannot read partition table for sd 0

Is any of the above normal for the seagate?  Or is it totally
hosed?  Or is it just a matter of getting the partition info
on there?  Any help appreciated.

It detected your host adapter, disk drive, etc.  Not being able to
read capacity is normal for SOME drives, most namely older Seagates
with brain dead firmware.

>hosed?  Or is it just a matter of getting the partition info

And, it's also hosed.  If compiled with gcc2.x, the seagate SCSI 
driver will become unhappy.  It has to do with how gcc decided 
to push bx and si onto the stack, changing where the len and 
data variables really were and where the assembler code thought
they were.

>on there?  Any help appreciated.

A new release of the SCSI drivers will be made "RSN" - hopefully 
tonight.  This should correct the stack frame problem caused by 
gcc2, add adaptec support, and a few other things.

It will be put up on 

headrest.woz.colorado.edu

the rootimage is (I think !) for a 1.2Mb floppy.  Try to find a rootimage for a 
1.44 disk - this could be the problem ...

Subject: backup problems
Date: 9 Apr 92 10:37:37 GMT


Has anyone had much luck in backing up their systems?  I 
have heard so many things about problems with different 
versions of tar ( and I have no clue which version I 
ended up with - I got at least 3 versions in the files
I ftp'e ) that I didn't want to use it for my backup.

I got cpio, zip and zoo.  I never learned to use zoo, so 
I tried zip first.  It works for text files, but when 
I try to zip /bin, it only does 3 or 4 files before
printing "EINVAL - error making temp file".

cpio seemed to work fine, so I made 6 cpio files that would
each fit (compressed)  onto a 1.4 M floppy and used dd
to write them onto a raw dos-formatted floppy.  I also 
un-cpio'd them into /tmp for a confidence check.

I booted Linux from floppy, re-partitioned my HD (needed 
more DOS space), installed the basic Liunux to HD, and tried 
to restore from my backups.  I read the compressed cpio files
in from the floppies, uncompressed them and attempted to 
un-cpio them.  It would give me the first few files from 
any archive fine, but then it would tell me that it was 
"skipping xxx bytes of garbage" for each file after that.

Well, my heart nearly stopped because I had spent way too 
many hours downloading that stuff at 2400 baud.  I tried 
the cpio again with the exact same results.  I tried it 
again and accidentally left off the "u" flag.  This made 
it skip the files that it had been able to extract before, 
and it was able to extract another 5 or 6 files before it
started "skipping xxx bytes of garbage" again.  Repeating 
this a few times allowed me to recover all the files.  

I then did another "fsck".  The filesystem had been fine 
before I started the restore, but it now gave me several 
pages of errors.  It was very late and I don't quite remember
what they were but it was something about a zone being 
marked in use but wasn't really used.  I ran "fsck -a"
and it fixed the errors.  

Anyone got any ideas what went wrong?  It looks to me 
like there is a bug in the gnu cpio port.  Does anyone
have a magic method for backing up their system?

BTW, I am using linux 0.95a on a AMD 386-40 with SIS chipset
and Diamond SS VGA.  Works great!

Hi Linuxers

I think that the next FAQ will be out at the end of the next week,
and if I work hard this WE, might be before.

I will correct Linux wrt PS/2 query, update as much as possible gcc
information (this will be easier 'cause I made a special section for
problems related to gcc).

If you have any comment, advise ... just let me know at

Ok, i think you get a start with the patches available at tesla.ee.cornell.edu,

on a (good old) vax, because of bugs in the gnu-ld...

Yes, there are several versions of bash existing - some of them are
/very/ old.  I don't know if the original bash.Z is still somehwre to be
found, but it was not too long ago, and that is the version I used under
0.01, long before linux had job control.  That version certainly doesn't
support job control.

Versions of bash that support job control (including the builtins fg,
bg, kill, jobs etc) are available on older root-disks, notably the 0.95
(not "a") rootdisk.  I don't know where to find a "standalone" version
of bash - I know somebody ported bash 1.12 (the one on the rootdisk is
1.11 patch-level 1, although I think "help" returns 0.00.1). 

You might want to check out the abc-release when it gets out - right now
the binaries under linux are a major mess (different versions under the
same name etc...), but this will eventually be sorted out, I hope.

I have never felt anybody needed to pay for linux - I didn't want to
make it share-ware, and I never wanted to make it commercial.  The
biggest reason I started on linux at all was that I had no good unix and
no money - I wanted a totally free unix (not "GNU-free", but "no-money"
free - the "GNU-free" came later).  I still have no money, but at least
I've got the unix :)

In fact, the earliest copyrights expressly forbid /any/ money at all
changing hands due to linux - the above was the reason.  As the system
actually became useable, I had to change my mind - I don't mind people
making money off linux, as long as it essentially is available for free
as well, which it is. 

I still feel strongly about the money-thing though - I don't want to
encumber the "official" version with any kind of pleas for money.  If I
had something like "if you enjoy this package, please send $10 to xxx"
it might scare away people from then sending other feedback (bugreports
etc), as they didn't send the money...  As it is, linux has no special
"registered users" which get special treatment by me - if you are
porting something important, I might give your troubles more thought
than the average user, but I try to answer every problem that gets
reported (even if it's just a "sorry, can't help this one" or "it's a
known problem, I don't know the cure", "hardware dependant"). 

One thing I would appreciate is people sending me postcards from all
over the world: I don't want to be a new Craig Shergold, but it might be
fun to see where linux is used :^).  Postcards (with least name and
location written in for reference) could be sent to:

                Linus Torvalds
                Pietarinkatu 2 A 2
                00140 Helsinki
                Finland

and maybe I'll wallpaper my room with them :). Or maybe not.

                Linus

PS.  If you have contacts with hardware suppliers, and would like to get
things like multi-serial cards/tape streamers etc supported...  I just
might be persuaded to try it out :-)

Subject: HELP! Problems with rootimage. (UPDATE)
Date: 8 Apr 92 23:31:38 GMT

A couple of days ago I complained that rootimage does not work
on my computer. It still doesn't. But I have got a lot of 
suggestions (many of which are quite similar to each other).
Thanks to all who tried to help me.
Here is a detailed list of my hardware and what I have already
tried.

WB 486/33, cache 64Kb, AMI BIOS 06/06/91, OPTI chipset
8Mb 80ns RAM (yeah I know they are slow), cache is 25ns
ISA bus
some cheap 16-bit Seagate IDE hard disk & two floppy disk 
controller
drive 0: Quantum 40A, 40Mb
drive 1: Seagate ST-1144A, 130Mb
two floppy drives: A=1.44Mb, B=1.2Mb
Paradise compatible 16-bit CVGA 1024 card with 512Kb RAM
Genius 6000 serial mouse at COM1
Ventel 1200bps modem card at COM2
Morse VGAplus 800x600 SVGA color monitor 
Sound Blaster 1.5, IRQ 7, port 220h
I don't know about the I/O card, but it has centronics, joystick
and two RS ports (joystick is switched off since Sound Blaster 
has one)

I have two problems.

Problem one: rootimage diskette does not load. 
After I put it in drive A and press enter, diskette drive
motor turns on for a couple of seconds but it sound like
nothing is loaded. Same problem on two other 486 machines
with AMI BIOS (but not with OPTI chipset).

Problem two: Linux complains about HD time out errors.
Solution: tell BIOS that there are no hard disks.
The other two machines does not have this problem.

What I have tried to solve problem one:
I have tried to make my system as slow as possible by switching
turbo off, setting memory wait states to max, turning internal
and external CPU caches off, disabling shadow RAM and dropping
bus speed to CLKI/6 (33Mhz/6 instead of normal CLKI/2.5).
Does not help.

I have tried to get many copies of the rootimage file, even from
two places: nic.funet.fi (rootimage) and sc.tamu.edu (miniroot
and boot_fd_ide). I have written those files to floppies using
rawrite.exe which I got from nic.funet.fi.

I have tried formatting my floppies with MS-DOS 5.0's format.com
and PC Tools 6.0's format (PCShell's format, not PCFormat) and 
FDFormat.

Does my computer hang totally after the rootimage fails? No, 
I can get task info by pressing Scroll Lock or Ctrl-Break. I can
write on the screen, but it has no effect. Task info:

0: pid=0, state=1, father=0, child=1, 2596/2932 chars free in 
   kstack, PC=0000B0DB
1: pid=1, state=2, father=0, child=-1, 2376/2932 chars free in
   kstack, PC=0000B1AA

If I tell my BIOS that there are no hard disk, 2376/2932 changes
to 2600/2932.

I think that is all. To do:
I will try to verify with Norton's NU that rootimage file is
identical to the rootimage diskette.

Does anyone have more suggestions? Plug off all cards one by one
to see which causes the problem?
If it was only my machine, but I have problems with three different
machines.......????
