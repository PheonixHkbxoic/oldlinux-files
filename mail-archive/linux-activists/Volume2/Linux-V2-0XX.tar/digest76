Date: 15 Apr 92 10:42:26 +1000

First off, thanks to all the work done by everyone to get Linux up and running.
Also, thanks to the writers of the new users and installation pages. I managed
to get 0.95a up and running with only one minor problem (accidentally swapping
the order for the hard disk device numbers).

Now I have a few questions (of course). When I was running the install scripts,
I checked they were flagged as executable, and tried to run them. No go. I then
tried /INSTALL/install and it worked ! OK, I thought Linux doesn't look in the
current directory for a file before searching the path (ala DOS) (is this
meant to work this way ? I am used to DOS and VMS, only just got started with
Unix). OK (he thinks again), why don't I put the current directory in the path ?
I typed set and got a list of the environment variables and there was one called
PATH, so I tried set PATH=....:. and still no go. 

So can someone tell me how to change the path under Linux ?

Thanks in advance,

If what was meant by "unstable" was "dynamic" and "moving", I agree.

I hope it remains that way. It's great working with an OS that mulitple
people are working on at all sorts of levels. It's an even greater
opportunity to learn.

But this is NOT FAIR! Anything remotely DOS-associated is definitely NOT
STABLE in that sense by definition. No memory protection == not relatively
stable.

I might mention that apart from during the boot process when I had the kernel
attempting to find it's root device in the wild blue yonder, I've _never_ had
a fatal kernel panic trap - not once in the last 5 weeks in which I've been
running it almost full time. I've been pushing it hard too. I've had gcc grind
the system (8 meg RAM + 8 meg swap) to a halt and cause some strange apparent
HD errors on the swap device (ie. out of vitual RAM), but after killing one of
the compiles and restarting when the other one stopped, it continued on...

Gee, if this is unstable, then what will "stable" be like? :-)

I previously ran Interactive UNIX for over 2 years. I remember seeing 3
panic traps in the first attempt to install it on exactly the same hardware!
I also installed it ans SCO's product on several machines as a part of my
work and I can honestly say that while the facilities offered by Linux don't
yet match the SCO/ISC product, that Linux certainly _feels_ and _acts_ more
stable in most ways.

I intend to. I'm pushing a couple of other things presently which is helping
to get on familiar territory in hacking the kernel, but that's the aim.

IMHO, fas is a little bloated. It certainly is nice, but I'd prefer to start
with something a little simpler. It will, however, support 16550AFNs and
hardware flow control (I need both myself :-)). From looking at the current
kernel sources, it would appear that some further changes to the kernel would
be required to correctly support shared-IRQ between (logical) devices.

If anyone else is working or intends to work on a similar project, I'd like
to know. Either I can help, or they can help me (same difference) or maybe
I'm wasting my time if someone else has already got it under control...

I am using an ESDI drive. Other than that, I have followed the installation
guildlines. They were pretty simple, I prepared the 95a boot and root diskes
on 1.2M floppies, set a partition with fdisk, that fdisk on linux was able

I recently installed Linux 0.95c+, and I have been unable to set up
swap space using either a separate partition or a swap file.  I'm
using an Adaptec SCSI card and SCSI target 1 for my file system
and the swap partition.  mkswap seems to work ok, but when I run swapon,
I get the "Unable to find swap-space signature" error.

Someone else who was using an Adaptec SCSI card posted that they
were having similar problems, and this leads me to wonder if swap
space and the Adaptec driver don't go together very well.

Can anyone confirm my suspicions?

Beta? copies of Solaris 2.0 should be released sometime in June'92. 
Solaris 2.0 will use a new design for device drivers which differs from 
SunOS 4.1 It might be useful to use Solaris 2.0 as a model since Solaris 2.0 
will support device drivers which can be load/unloaded on the fly without 
rebooting the operating system.

The ability to load/unload device drivers while the system is running is
a very useful feature as it makes it much easier to test new device drivers
and it makes it much easier to have systems auto-configure themselves.

According to both Juergen Henke and Mike Dobson
you can also "rawrite" your .tar.Z files directly to the floppy
and use one of the folflowing lines to untar the file.

          tar xvZf /dev/PS0
   or     tar xvpz </dev/PS0

   is doing the development on a Linux system.

This is optimistic for two reasons:

    1.  I'm getting my own machine primarily to do my own playing with OS
        R&D, windows development, new-technology compiler development, and
        suchlike, starting with Linux as a base, and hoping to contribute
        to Linux itself.  I _want_ the machine to also be a great platform
        for me to do Fortran-compiler development, but that might be asking
        too much; it might just serve as a really huge terminal for that
        particular job.  Or, the FSF might be lending a separate machine
        (68k based) for my Fortran work.

    2.  I still have no idea whether _any_ port of my Fortran compiler will
        "work fairly well".  Naturally, I'm very hopeful, but this is out-and-
        out the largest and longest coding job I've ever done with essentially
        no ongoing input or testing by other people.

But I hope your optimistic prediction proves correct!  After all, if my
machine (which I'm planning on ordering so it arrives in early May) finds
itself running Linux, gcc 2.1, and other such things quickly, then I will
probably use it to do Fortran stuff right away, and who knows, maybe the
compiler _will_ be fairly decent as it goes to alpha!

Nobody should bet their careers on it, though.  :-)

Haven't they fixed that yet?  I found the same problem in 5.0 too, as did
anyone else who used DR DOS and Minix.  When the DR DOS disk driver checks
partition types it masks the ID with 0x7f (looks like a bad patch to make
someone happy, but it's pretty stupid.)

If you feel like fixing the real source of the problem, you could remove
the mask from DR DOS.  But make sure you understand what you're doing
if you change it.  It works for me with 5.0.

It's not that bad - "important" patches do make it back into the standard 
distribution (ie what's necessary for a real ps, faster floppy and 
lp drivers, the virtual consoles, VFS, minor patches in the boot 
sector and hard disk driver, etc) fairly quickly.  

Also, as Linux becomes more stable, kernel patches will become less 
necessary.
