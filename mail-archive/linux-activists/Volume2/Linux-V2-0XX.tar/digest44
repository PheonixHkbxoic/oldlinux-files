This may be a really dumb question, so please forgive my ignorance...

I just installed linux on my HD yesterday and now I am interested
in getting gcc and some other programs to use with it.  How do I
go about getting these to my Linux partition?  It's easy enough
to transfer to DOS, but how can Linux access the DOS to move it
over?  It seems that kermit or some other comm program would be
necessary in Linux?

Please e-mail, as I'm still wading through a mess of unread 
articles.

Thanks,
Ryan

Oops, stupid me.  I accidentally wrote out the unpatched version of the
kernel to the tar file -- i.e., it was looking for the root filesystem
on the floppy disk.  Sorry for the stupid question.

I might add that I now have GCC 2.1, VI, Kermit, tcsh, and many other
toys to play with.  Linux does indeed kick mucho ass!

Three cheers to Linus for a great job!

Everybody seems to disagree, however I think that some of the archives need to
be cleaned up: I downloaded Linux 0.95 yesterday: Total of 15Mb, It just fits
on 6 floppies if you delete all the binaries that are doubled (less than 10M)!

I think that someone should take a freshly installed system, and make nice 
uniform tar files for everything that is there.

My hard disk with 0.95 installed over 0.12 crashed.  After getting a new
drive, I found myself having to install from scratch.  So I went and
got the latest root disk 0.95a.  When I found that BASH was not on
it, I mounted the 0.95 root disk and copied both BASH (/bin/sh) and the
PASSWD executable from it to my new system disk (/usr/local/bin/bash,
and /bin/passwd).

In a related issue, When I formatted my new 200MB IDE drive under DOS,
I created one DOS primary (bootable) partition, and put the rest
of my DOS logical drives in the DOS extended partition.  This leaves
me two primary partitions for LINUX, which I configured using the
pfdisk on the 0.95a root disk.  However, the infamous extended partition
bug kept both the 0.95 and 0.95a fdisk from correctly reading my
partition table on /dev/hda.  This resulted in my inability to
know for sure which logical linux devices I needed to run mkfs and
mkswap on!  I had to get the fdisk from the 0.12 root disk, and
create a /dev/hd0 link to /dev/hda in order to find out which
was /dev/hd3 (/dev/hda3) and which was /dev/hd4 (/dev/hda4).

patches to the kernal are NO GOOD if you cannot be sure which
devices to make in order to put your system on hard disk!

Based on this, someone had better put together a BOOTIMAGE and
a ROOTIMAGE for 0.95c if we want users to be able to install
LINUX in systems that do not already have LINUX partitions!
You just can't expect non-hacker users to have to have 3 rootdisks
around to get all the necessary software in one place (never mind
the changing of the device names too.  Sigh).

When I get done re-creating my system, I'll be happy to post a list
of the software I had to download, in addition to what was on the
0.95a root disk, and install in order to make my system useable
to me.

Not all of these executables are on the 0.95a root disk.  fdisk-x,
hostname, and passwd.  Who is packaging these executables for us?

(I downloaded hostname from tsx-11, and got passwd from my 0.95
root disk.  Where can I find fdisk-x?????)

bash is not ksh but similar
 the default editing mode is emacs, pressing M-C-j (esc ctrl-j) switches
to vi-editing-mode ( C-e switches to back to emacs style)
   or at the shell prompt use:

      set -o vi
      set -o emacs

I will *NOT* be producing the "ABC Release of Linux .95a" before I go on
vacation.  I am currently over-whelmed by work, and won't have free-time
before leaving on Saturday morning.

In the off-chance that I do get some time, it will be devoted to getting

Hi everyone,

I think this non-destructive partitioning is the route I want to take. I've
done most things up to the point of running pfdisk and I feel fairly confident
of what I'm doing but there's one thing that's hanging me up. I guess this is
kind of a DOS question but there's probably more repartitioning going on here
than the average DOS newsgroup.

I'm running DOS 5.0 and Norton for DOS 5.0 and the Norton optimizer reports the
very last few clusters of the hard disk as being unmovable and owned by a file
called 'image.idx'. I believe this has something to do with an extra copy of
the DOS 5.0 boot image. The question is, does DOS absolutely need this file in
that particular location, or might it possibly create a new image in the last
few clusters of a new partion? If not, can this file be moved and how?

I've got an extra 40meg free on my hard drive that's got Linux written all
over it. Thanks!

        Hi, this is my first post here so if this has already been dealt with
in a FAQ somewhere please let me know. I recently grabbed GCC2.1 beta, the
shared libs, and the kernel patches from tsx-11 and am having problems with
the libs. When I run the install.sh in /usr/lib/shared/obj, it invokes the
2.1 GCC with options -s -o on the make.a file. this (i assume) then invokes
the linker, which promptly bombs with "unknown option: ---" followed by a
usage message. Ive tried invoking it by hand and it always seems to generate
this error message. I'm using the ld that came in binutils.tar.Z, but I noticed
its only a couple hundred bytes different, could I perhaps have grabbed the
wrong one? 
        Another GCC2.1 problem: when I install the 2.1kern patches (aside from
the somewhat odd path [/mnt/linux/... for the kernel sources] that it puts in
every makefile) it generates parse errors on a lot of the linux kernel headers.
        This may have been covered elsewhere; are the /usr/src/linux/include
files duplicated in the old gcc1.4 /usr/include? are they in gcc2.1 includes?
        Finally, until I get around to digging through the famous ralph brown
interrupt list, has anyone else found the need to use more than 2 serial ports
at once? I don't know enough about the coding of comm routines myself, but,
since sharing IRQ's is basically nonfunctional for concurrent IO in DOS,
I have my third serial port (3e8) set to IRQ5. Anyone have patches || diffs
|| help in general with changing the serial drivers to use it? (Digging through
the includes didn't seem to help ;-) )
        Thanks in advance for any help, responses, email, flames, et cetera,
and a great big THANKS! to Linus and all the other code wizards for putting

Right - I thought I made it clear that there was the addition of a
couple of minor utilities, such as hostname, passwd, chsh, etc.
fdisk-x is actually just a new version of fdisk, but I have kept the
old fdisk around for now.  Eventually, fdisk-x will replace fdisk.

As far as I know, nobody is packaging the executables - I'm releasing
the source, but not executables, since they can easily be compiled.
Once the ABC Release is out, this sort of issue will be moot - I
expect both binaries and sources for this to be part of that.  Until
then, you'll have to recompile them yourself, or find someone else to
do it.

>(I downloaded hostname from tsx-11, and got passwd from my 0.95
>root disk.  Where can I find fdisk-x?????)

The source can be found on tsx-11 in
/pub/linux/patches/fdisk-extended.c, or something very similar.  It
will also be available in the package I'm putting together.  The
executable, as of yet, is unavailable.

A quick, fairly uncertain word on a v0.95c root disk.  Don't count on
seeing one!  The 0.95a root disk will still work, and has no
unsurmountable problems.  I would much rather wait for the 0.96
release of Linux to do another root disk.  I may change my mind,
however, so keep your ears open.
