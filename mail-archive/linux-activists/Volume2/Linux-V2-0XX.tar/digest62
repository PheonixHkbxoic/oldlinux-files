No.  sync merely commits the buffercache to disk.  Buffers will be 
committed to disk when buffercache is full, or a sync()  syscall
is performed.  To prevent heinous catastrophees, update is 
run from /etc/rc. update syncs the disks every 30 seconds.

Most hard disks these days autopark, so that shouldn't be a problem.

There is a cut and paste via mouse kernel patch, and the kernel 
supports screen dumps to a file.

It's more than annoying -- I'm running a Telebit modem, and I get about
1MB of stuff a day through.  I've had to drop down to 2400 baud with
another modem to get it to consistently work.  It's only a matter of time

Subject: Losing Characters
Date: 13 Apr 92 22:51:05 GMT

Last night I was transferring a file using xcomm and the rz that is
distributed with it, and all was working well until the program went
to disk to write the data that it had just received.  Using a USRobotics
Dual Standard communicating at 19.2kbps, a CRC error would be generated
each time Linux went to write something out to disk.  This problem was
not at all due to processor load (I could run 4 infinite loops in other
tty's and not have it affect the transfer at all), but due seemingly to
interrupt latency.  I have the modem running off of a 16550 UART, but
my tests show that at powerup, the 16 byte buffer is turned off.  Should
I need to use the buffer for Linux to keep up with 19.2kbps transfers?
I've got some pascal code that turns the buffer on and off, and I'm
working on getting that translated into Linux useable code.  When I get
that done, I'll stick it up (if there's interest).

I've got a 486/33 with two fairly quick Seagate hard drives, so I wouldn't
think that there would be much problem keeping up.  Is there something I
may be doing wrong?  I've also got a 5 meg swap partition set up..

Thanks in advance..

The only things unstable in Linux right now is caused by the lack of 
limits and a reasonable scheme to insure that there is enough virtual
memory for every process running, and tar not handling EOF and consequently
multi-volume tars correctly.

I think that before Linux reaches 1.0, it definately needs to have the limit
system calls implemented, and a "real" filesystem on top of VFS, 
such as Berkely FFS, or LFS.

To be on a par with what BSD / HURD / etc will be once they are out 
of development, an X port should be finished,
and support for TCP / IP over "standard" ethernet boards, as well as
SLIP / CSLIP in the kernel should be added.  QIC-02 tape support 
would be nice too.

Seems like DRDOS thinks partition types are 7 bits since it called my
Minix partition (0x81) a DOS 2.0 partition (0x01). I'm going to use a
partition type < 0x80 for Linux to keep DRDOS happy.

   Would someone send me the diffs (only) for gcc/gpp 2.0 for linux as a host?
I am trying to get a crosscompiler working and I need those diffs to start
my compliation (not wanting to re-invent the wheel) This will be for internal
use only and will never be released.  I do not have FTP access and there is
some urgency (read desperation) to this request.  I have 2.0 running under
0.95a and all is co-pacetic.  I just put the source (aquired thru mail) on
the system and would like to get to work ASAP.
Thanks

does not work -- pressing of backspace doesn't move the cursor

any pointers will be greatly appreciated.

To clear up any questions:  The 'getty' on the 0.95a root disk is the
*exact* same program as 'agetty' on the 0.95 root disk.  I renamed it
for the 0.95a release to be consistent with other Unix implementations.

"Everything"?  "rather unstable"?  What are you basing these

than DOS+DESQview on my machine, and allows me to get even more done,
with the small exception of word processing.  (Which I hope to
overcome, once I figure out how the !@$*!@ to set up TeX.  I

>when will Linux 1.0 come to the PC 386/486 world ?

How about when Linux is stable?  Really, Linus has said before that he
had intended Linux 1.0 to be released when it was able to run GCC.  It
is obviously far beyond that point now, with the addition of SCSI
support, printer support, virtual console support, serial port
support, etc.

Linux 1.0 will be sooner if you help....

Sure.  This took some doing, and I'd appreciate some feedback.
I moved the # sign from the Makefile to boot/setup.S, so I now
use "2" instead of "\#2" in the Makefile.  And now if you set
SVGA_MODE to "VGA" it will compile a kernel that boots EGA/VGA
mode, no questions asked (well, it doesn't wait for you to 
answer :-,).

I've assembled all three versions; SVGA_MODE undefined prompts
you for a RETURN key and then a number, SVGA_MODE=VGA acts like
you hit another key and sets EGA/VGA mode, and SVGA_MODE=2 sets
my favorite SVGA mode.  They all seem to work right for me.

With mv math_emulate.c to emulate.c got linux-0.95c+ to compile.

Recommend adding sync line at end of disk:  ala Image:  which already
ends with a sync.

BTW:  CTRL-ALT-DEL using AMI BIOS on 386 no longer works, am I suppose
to use the re-boot program?

I find the speeded-up auto-repeat too fast.  This "feature" should be in
the top level Makefile (I actually haven't looked where its at).
