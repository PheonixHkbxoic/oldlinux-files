An early version of X was just released for 386BSD, I understand.
From the initial announcement, it seems that one needs 300M (!) to
compile it.  I can't imagine it will run happily in less that 8M of memory.

I have no intention of clobbering my modestystem with X, so I, too,
would like to see a smaller graphics interface.  I've never heard of
MGR, however.

In terms of TeX previewers, the absolute BEST I've seen is, amazingly,
for MS-DOS.  The drivers pacakged with emTeX, in my opinion, can't be
beat.

have a fixed version just waiting to replace it...  I know I saw

I'm willing to do an Ethernet device driver for Linux...but I don't know how
Ethernet devices look to code that opens the associated device. What does the
API look like? I presume it presents a character device to the OS, with ioctls
for specialized functions, but I'm not going to reinvent any wheels, or design
any new interfaces, I don't have to. I'm planning to start with the 3Com
3C503, since that's what I have; the code will be adapted from the Clarkson
Packet Drivers, though (which are GNU-licensed as is), in a straightforward
way (I hope), so others can follow the same trail.

>How can you repartition ms-dos drives without loosing info?

There are a few things to be warned about:

1) fdisk does not allow you to "change" a partition, you have to
   delete the old one and recreate the "changed" version.

2) When fdisk  creates a partition it will mark the partition as
   "freshly partitioned", and MSDOS will ignore all and every bit
   of info on it. (i.e. IT WIPES YOUR DISK!)

3) Minix fdisk does what it is supposed to do: It only touches the
   bootblock.

4) I've done it twice: I am an experienced repartitioner, without
information loss, however I dont do it because I can't make a backup,
I do it because I hate to have to reload the backup.

5) Now for the solution: you need at least half a disk free.
   a) Use a disk optimizer to get all the files off the second
      half of the disk. 
   b) make a second partition, starting at about half the disk,
      (what you do with your old partition I don't know: you could
      leave it overlapping with the new one, as that is what is the
      case, however most partitioners won't allow you to do that, so
      you will have to change it, but look at point 2 above!)
   c) format the second partition.
   d) copy all files from the first partition, to the second partition.
   e) format the first partition.
   Now you are stuck with two partitions, and a "valid" disk.
   between steps b and e your disk is "invalid" and you should not
   perform any "work" on it since that is quite likely to corrupt your
   filesystem.

The advantage of doing it this way is that you have a HD to HD copy,
instead of a floppy to HD reload of the bakcup. However if you make a
mistake, you are most likely going to lose lots of files.


Disclaimer: Theoretically this should work on some computers operated
by an experienced computer freek. This is very unlikely to apply to you.
In short, don't do it.

   From what I understand, POSIX is pretty much irrelevant once you get
past the basic semantics of the interface. GNU is comprised of the Mach 3.0
microkernel and a collection of user-level OS services build on top of it
know as the GNU Hurd. While binary compatability with BSD is one of the
design goals of GNU, they are also looking beyond it. GNU supports things
like special files for compatability's sake, but they will also provide
an interface that uses Mach IPC to communicate directly with the device
driver, circumventing the file system. Hurd will also provide the ability
for users to install their own file servers and exec servers, given the
proper permissions. One example of the possibilities for this sort of thing
is the Plan 9 /proc file system. There are more extensions planned, but
it has been a while since I have read over them.
   So while you would be correct in your assessment on the basic Unix
functionality point, that rather overlooks the major changes in the
underlying GNU structure.

Thats an awfull lot of work you're aking of people that are basically
providing you with a free operating system, compilers, utilities,
applications, and documentation. I'm glad to see that you are willing to
contribute work to help, but I don't think you go far enough. Instead of
complaining you should be organizing or working on the items you say we

As do we all, the thing is, most of the people you complain about are
actually trying to do something to help others. The ftp site
administrators, the FAQ maintainer, the documentation writers, and the
program authors and porters all deserve more respect for their effors,
and a big round of applause too.

More often than not, I'm unable to uncompress .Z files from the net.
(Yes, I donwload them in binary mode every time.)  I suspect this is a
case of the already-discussed problem with kermit corrupting files.

At any rate, the real problem is that when I uncompress a bad .Z file,
uncompress takes all available memory, and then some, and so kills the
system.  Other processes get killed, e.g.  The whole idea is that one
process getting screwed up isn't supposed to interfere with another.

Will this be fixed soon?

Using pfdisk, it's actually not that bad.  Use a disk optimizer to put all your
stuff on the front of the disk.  Use pfdisk to create your partitions, making 
sure that the DOS partition is bigger than all the stuff you now have in it.
If it's your boot partition, use Norton or something to edit the boot record so
that the whole filesystem believes it's the right size.

Then boot from linux and mkfs on your new partition(s).  No problem.

Subject: Questions about answers in Linux FAQ w.r.t. OS/2
Date: Sat, 4 Apr 1992 22:15:34 GMT

I have two comments/questions about the Linux FAQ.  I have not (before now)
read this newsgroup.

(1) The question "How does Linux operate in an OS/2 environment?" is answered
with "Fine."  What exactly does this mean?  The most obvious answer is that
OS/2 and Linux can coexist on a disk, and that you can boot either one of them
(probably using OS/2's boot manager).

(2) The answer to "How big is the 'complete' Linux package?" leaves out a lot
of information.  The totals given do not appear to contain, say, all the
programs from /bin, /usr/bin, /etc, and so forth that Unix needs to operate. 
Is a binary distribution of all this stuff available?  If so, how large is it?

Comparing the Linux boot and root disks, kernel source, and libc source to the
entire OS/2 LA distribution just isn't fair.  OS/2 contains binary
distributions for all OS/2 stuff, plus a complete DOS and Windows 3.0
distribution, plus a large number of fonts for the Adobe Type Manager,
migration tools for Windows programs, and so forth.  The user can choose how
much of this to install, and it usually isn't necessary to use all 20 disks.

Note that I am not claiming that OS/2 is not much larger than Linux.  However,
the FAQ appears to be misleading, and that is not a FAQ's job.  I'd like to
know the real answer.

Thanks!
