Does this mean that for IDE drives, shoelace is a permanent step???
If so, a notice to that effect would be welcome in the FAQ!

Nope,
        I talked to John, so now I will (hopefully) explain what should
happen when you install shoelace.

1) Try it out on floppies first!!!  
        Read the docs, it explains what is going on.

2) Try it out on floppies first!!!
        Read the docs, it explains what is going on. (Get my drift :-)

3) When you finally install shoelace onto your hardrive, install it in a
 partition.  DON'T install it in on the whole drive.  This means don't
install it on /dev/hda, but on /dev/hda[1234].  On an IDE drive you
can't low-level format to get rid of winiboot w/out re-writing a new one
on top of the old one.

4) If you want to install it on your WHOLE drive, copy the old version
of the master boot sector to a  floppy so you can go restore it if you need
to.
        Something like :
        $ dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/floppy
        Do a <CTRL-C> after a few seconds and you will have it saved to
floppy.  Someone with a bit more knowledge than I can give you the block
count and block size to be exact.

5) When you want to use shoelace, use fdisk and set the partition that
contains the shoelace bootblok to active.  If you don't like, don't set that
partition to active.

6) Even if you don't install shoelace on the whole drive, it still might be a
good idea to save the old boot sector to a floppy, before you install
shoelace.


This posting probably was more confusing than helpful, so email me
if you have questions/need more information.

This may sound like an outrageous amount of work, but in the long
run it may prove to be worth it:  I think commercially available
DOS emulators (well, I can really only speak for the ones available
in AIX because that's all I'm familiar with) use DOS itself to provide
INT 21h support.  Provided you supply all the BIOS and I/O support
(this is the really outrageous part!--big IF!), DOS itself should
be able to run providing INT 21h support.  I have seen this approach
recommended before.

The reason it would be well worth the time to develop is that you
are more assured that ALL DOS software will run, and it should be
easier to support follow-on versions of DOS as it becomes available.

However, the magnitude of the work might be overwhelming for one
person, so keep up the good work however you decide to go!  It
sounds real promising!

That won't work, the tools that come with shoelace have no way to remove
the shoelace bootstrap program that was written into the Master Boot Record
on the hard drive.  To get the standard DOS bootstrap back you have to use
something like Norton Utilities.  If you have completely backed up your
hard drive, you can also perform a low level format of the hard drive
followed by a high level format and reinstallation.  Maybe someone else
knows an easier way.

I was wondering if anyone knew if the libm.a that comes with 
GCC could be recreated for a system with a Co-Processor or 486.

If such a monster exists, could someone point me to it.  And 
maybe some test code with binary file sizes to check if it works
right.

---As a side note, how does Linux deal with sharing the co-processor
among various users. Or does it???

Folks who are having trouble, how are you reading and/or writing the
floppy? dd(1) really loves to drop out chunks of data, because it treats
each inbound chunk of data as a block; if it doesn't get as much on a
read as its blocksize, it calls it a short block. If the floppy is
correctly written then the sequence

        cat /dev/PS0 | compress -d | tar xvf -

should process correctly, and it will only blow up after you get past
all the good data in the archive (and extract it); then compress will
proceed to go nuts on the extra garbage past the end of the archive.
Harmless, though annoying.

Likewise, use cat(1) to write the floppy. If you need to split up a big
archive, use split(1). If you don't have enough disk to hold a copy of
the whole archive (split wants to write its pieces to xaa, xab, ...)
then you could try something like what I did in my wrflops script
(recently posted here in floptools.sh), where I used a separate little C
program (I called it catbytes) to bust up the input stream into
floppy-sized wads, and separate invocations of cat(1) to deposit them
onto the floppies.

First question, does anyone know where I can get hold of any shells for

Second, I have the source to the kernel and a bunch of utilities, plus GCC
2.1.  How do I tell it to activate shared libraries, or does it just do it?

   1.  How many documented DOS calls are there?

   The answer is "many".  The DOS kernel is ~50K of machine code.   You 
   don't want to duplicate that.  Instead, you emulate what DOS runs on,
   and catch all of the programs that run there too, and run a *REAL*
   dos.

Actually, what I would do is emulate DOS by mapping the DOS filesystem
calls into Unix filesystem calls.  That should simply things quite a
bit.  Of course, you will still have to emulate the BIOS calls, since
many programs call direct to the BIOS.  But if you emulate the BIOS
calls and the DOS 2.11 calls, you'd be surprised how many DOS programs
will actually run correctly.  

One question about your (Matthias's) technique however; as I recall, the
386 virtual memory mode requires that the task use *virtual memory*
addresses from 0k to 640k, where the kernel is currently located.  You
can fix this by actually swapping the page maps in and out, but that's
much more significant than just changing the segment registers.  Are you
actually playing page map games to make this work?  And if so, how are
you doing this?

this question is for the c programmers out there.  I have a few basic and pascal
programs that I would like to re-write in C, but a lot of them use some type of
random number generator.  I once saw a reference to a random() function, and I 
am wondering if this (or some other random function)is included in gcc 2.1 .
If not, I have some C source to create a pseudo-random # based on a user inputed
seed.  I figure that if I use the date/time info for the seed, it should serve the
purpose.  However, I don't know the calls for time/date functions.  :(
(In case you can't tell, I am quite new to C, I am native to Pascal, but I have 
a book written to teach C to Pascal programmers called: _C_Programming_in_a_UNIX
_Environment_  I got it for a class I didn't take.  I also have: _C_Primer_Plus_

None of the heads are spring loaded.  It is possible that some 
manufacturers could use some kind of cap to discharge but I have never
seen one large enough to do that or even enough room inside a drive
to mount a cap that large  (I used to build hard drives).   
They have a nice big spindle motor to spin the media, which I believe
is being used as a generator when the power is shut off.  Not only
would that be able to generate power to park the heads but it would serve
as a brake to help it spin down faster.  Notice they usually spin down
pretty quick...  that isn't bearing friction :-)

Apparently, no one knew where bootlin.zip is, and so Fabien uploaded
another copy -- it is
/pub/linux/INSTALL/bootlin.zip

GDB 4.5
/pub/linux/[binaries,source]/usr.bin/gdb-4.5.tar.Z
        (both are the same file, containing binary and diffs to the

dvi2xx
/pub/linux/binaries/tex/dvi2xx.tar.Z

And finally, I removed the link from linux-0.95c++.tar.Z to
pre-0.96.tar.Z because it was confusing several people, I believe.
Sorry to anyone I confused.

I would like to apologize for being behind _again_ on the buglist and
slightly behind on the patch directory -- my professors are beginning
to demand that I actually _do_ something in their classes... ;-)

That's correct - a 386 virtual mode task must start at 
virtual address 0, and if you allow the full address space of 
a 286 in real mode, up to 1M + ~64K.

    Are you

Look on tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/binaries/groff, or some such
directory.  It installs easily and works great.  For typeset output,
you'll need a postscript printer, ghostscript (which ports fairly
easily), or a TeX dvi driver (and Computer Modern fonts).  I usually use
the dvi output, dvips (and metafont), and ghostscript to get output on
my Alps Allegro, which is Epson compatable.  I think the CM fonts are
better that the ghostscript fonts, at least at 360x180 dpi, and I use
TeX, so I have dvips and metafont set up.

There is also cawf, a little nroff-like program.
