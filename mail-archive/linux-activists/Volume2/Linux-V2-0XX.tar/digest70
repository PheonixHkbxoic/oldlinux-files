As long as /lib is on your root partition, and /lib/lib92.04.* is
actually present in that directory, and *not* a sym-link, you can use
shared binaries in /bin just fine.  /lib/lib92.04.* really shouldn't
be symlinked....

The idea of keeping a good boot disk and root disk is valid, though.
I've had to go back to mine on a few occasions.  (Usually the boot
disk, when I screw up a kernel compilation.)

!Are you able to use your SyncMaster 4 at 1280x1024 without problems?
!
!David
        First let me say that the Samsung Syncmaster 4 is only advertised as a  
1024*768 monitor.
        I don't use 1280*1024 for anything right now, but the test program  
supplied with the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280/D uses that mode successfully on my  
Syncmaster 4.  It has flicker since it is 48Hz interlaced.  I have to fiddle  
with the size and position knobs some to center the image.  It is a bit coarse  
since the Syncmaster 4 is .31mm dot pitch. 
        If you are looking for advice on finding a GOOD monitor for something  
serious like CAD at 1280*1024 I would suggest that you look elsewhere or you  
may be disappointed.

I'm not sure about this, but once you have completely recompiled
everything to use shared libs, you should have a savings in disk
space.

Does anyone have any figures on how much space is saved when using
shared libraries?

Thanks to coutant@imag.imag.fr, now I can boot linux from my
hard drive (dev/hdb2) directly. I used mutiple config.sys files and left
autoexec.bat empty when booting linux. There is only one line needed in
config.sys file:
SHELL=c:\bootlin.com c:\etc\boot95c (boot image file).

I used to have boot-image floppy handy when starting linux, not any more.

If you have both Linux and MS-DOS on the same machine, the simplest
course of action is to use mtools (i.e., mread, mcopy, or mtype) to
access them.

If you do not have both Linux and MS-DOS on the same machine, the
simplest course of action is to copy the files to a dos disk, then
use mtools to read the floppy.

>* Shall i use "rawrite" from DOS to put the files on floppy?

The 'rawrite' program is intended for use with disk images.  It CAN
write a tar file to a disk, and in fact this is how I originally
installed Linux on my machine, but it is probably simpler to use
copy and mtools.

>* I rememer reading something like "Do not rawrite compressed files.".
>  Why??

The problem is, I think, that compress is written to read from a
file or a stream, and that its I/O does not handle a raw read from a
disk correctly.  Anyway it didn't when I first installed Linux.

For larger files, it would be best to split them up, copy them over
on separate floppies, and concatenate them, that is, assuming that
you have no DOS partition on your Linux machine.  Unfortunately I
cannot point you to any standard utility running on DOS which would
do this painlessly.  I did this once with a GNUish DOS dd, which I
found in the anonymous ftp at, I believe, grape.ecs.clarkson.edu.

James Craig Burley, who is writing the GNU Fortran compiler,

The 'free' command from the 2.1ps distribution does this.  If swapping
is not enabled, it displays only memory; otherwise it displays two lines,
one for memory and one for swap, each giving total, used, and free, and
memory also mentioning how much is shared.

Of course, you could always notice what swapon reports:

     Adding Swap: 1061 pages (4345856 bytes) swap-space

or something of the sort.

The best tool I have seen is the rdev program, from Werner Almesberger
of ETH.  With no arguments it prints out the first line for /etc/mtab,
with one argument (a boot image) it prints the device configured as
the root device, and with two arguments (boot image, device), it sets
the device as the default root in the specified image.

Source is available by anonymous ftp from several sites, and I think
the program is on the latest root disks instead of rootdev.
It is on the utilities disk of my 'interim' version.

Date: 14 Apr 92 12:27:58 GMT

Someone reported recently that the Linux/Minix partitions
created by my fdisk 0.91 are recognised as DOS partitions
by Dr. DOS 6.0.  I suspect what is happening is that
Dr. DOS is ignoring the high bit of the type field.  If
this is so, it should certainly be reported to the Dr. DOS
suppliers, since it will cause problems for MINIX users
as well.  The 8-bit field contains 00000001 for a DOS partition
with a 12-bit FAT, and 10000001 for MINIX/Linux.  You can
always change to another number, e.g., 0x41, which I expect
even Dr. DOS will let alone.

A bug in the version of fdisk 0.91 makes it delete partition
5 incorrectly.  This bug is fixed in fdisk 0.92, which I shall
be distributing soon.

The include files distributed with the kernel should not be part of
normal C programs, and are closely linked with the kernel.  For the
purpose of compiling fundamental utilities, they are often useful, and
for this reason I have usually put at least those in linux/include/linux
and those in linux/include/asm into /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm
respectively.

I hope this will NOT become the official practice, in that I do NOT want
to see these files 'distributed' with the compiler; this would cause too
many problems coordinating versions.  The include files used to compile
Linux MUST be able to be changed as Linux changes, and so are distinct
from the include files used by the C compiler.  In any case, the only
compilation about which I have heard that these include files caused a
difficulty was the compilation of tools/build, which is, of course, not
part of the kernel, but a tool used to put the kernel together.

OK, for everyone having trouble with tar &/| compress, read this:

              --- Please Post as Binaries ---

These are compress and tar compiled using GCC 2.1 from fresh sources
from prep.ai.mit.edu. They use the static libraries and should run on
most versions of Linux.

These should definately fix the problems people have been having with
bad tars and compresses.

I have tested this tar + compress against tar + compress as done on a
RS/6000 box and have found no differences in the extracted files.

Just to make sure, using sum or cksum -o 1 gives
        37922   54  compress
        09607   329 tar

Enjoy!

        jim wiegand -- v5068u@vm.temple.edu -- jwiegand@moe.eng.temple.edu
        
These files have been installed as
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/compress
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/tar

they have not been compressed or tarred, for obvious chicken & egg
reasons.

enjoy.


BTW, also tcsh 6.01 has been put in the same directory.  Enjoy!
