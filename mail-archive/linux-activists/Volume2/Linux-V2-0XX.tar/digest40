   >From Linus's second patch, we are moving to VFS. As a result, there
   will be some changes in libc.a. That means next release of gcc 2.x and
   libs will not run under the kernel below Linus's second patch to 0.95a.
   I strongly recommend you move to 0.95a with Linus's second patch if you
   haven't done so.

If this is so, then we should make available a new bootimage and
patched source at the major ftp sites, I think.  Requiring a new
kernel for the compiler should mean easy access to a runnable
system...

Well, look.  If you want to recompile everything from scratch each time
a new release comes out, more power to you!  Most of the stuff in the
FTP archive servers is available in source form, or if not, can be found
at your nearest GNU FTP server.  If someone puts something up for
anonymous FTP for which you can't find source, feel free to flame the
person who put it up.  (*NOT* the administrators of the FTP site,
please!  :-).

However, I don't think it's fair that you ask everybody to recompile all
of the binaries each time a new release comes out.  For this reason, I
do not plan on deleting the binaries subdirectory on TSX-11.  If you
don't trust the binaries there; fine, don't use them.  There will be
some people who will want to use the binaries which are provided there
instead of compiling their own from source.  That's fine too.  If
someone has a problem with one of the binaries, and recompiles it from
scratch, and uploads to the various FTP sites, I'm sure we'd be happy to
replace the broken version with the fixed one.

Well I'm another whose found tar (and/or tar+compress) unreliable.
I'm using the pair from the binutils archive, but I've tried the ones
on the 0.95a root disk as well.  I've encountered sporadic failures
both on extracting and creating tar archives.  It also refuses to
create multi-volume compressed archives (although it will do
non-compressed ones).

In one case, tar refused (it just stopped, but would respond to ^C) to
create an archive from a directory where the files had bizarre group
ids (some 5-digit number I don't recall) until I changed the group on
all the files to root.

I'm sorry I don't have time to work on this, because a reliable,
standard archiver/backup utility is a very high priority item.

        First of all, I would like to congratulate "I Reid" on an
excellent beginners guide.  I beleive there are some errors in the
hard disk installation part, however.  (It looks like a problem of not
updating some of the manual when other parts change.)  I could be
wrong, but the four parts below look really suspicious...

[here are appropriate headers and my comments on the guide]

Section II: Installation to Hard Disk

3.
[...]
  then you use the "unnameable" command to partition your hard disk.
  The format of this command is

  n sys_id first_cluster last_cluster sys_name

  where n ............ is the partition number
        sys_id ....... is a magic number (ID in example above)
    and sys_name ..... is optional and should not be used ('cos it
                       makes things fail (strange but true)

[...]
  For the example disk I would type the following

pfdisk> 2 6 0 292
pfdisk> 1 128 293 521
[**********1: should these lines read:
           pfdisk> 1 6 0 292
           pfdisk> 2 128 293 521
                    (swap the partition #s)]
  Explanation time..... partition 1 is now a Dos partition with 293
  clusters (0 to 292 inclusive). Partition 2 is a Linux partition with
  228 clusters.

  Last bit... last but not least is the 'a' command ('a' for active)
  which marks a partition as the one to boot from. I chose partiton 1
  (DOS) 'cos Linux cannot boot entirely from hard disk without some
  assistance (more later (eventually)). So ....

pfdisk> a 2
[**********2: should this read: "pfdisk> a 1" ?]

 4. That wasn't too bad was it? Now all you need to do is make a Linux
    filesystem, [...]

# fdisk

Disk 0:
    /dev/hda1:  61516 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
    /dev/hda2:  48090 blocks unknown partition type 0x80
[...]

        Next you use the mkfs command (make filesystem) with the following
    format
 
    mkfs -c device blocks

    the -c option specifies that it should perform some checking as it
    works and the blocks figure is the one from fdisk (above). To make
    a file system on this partition I would type

# mkfs -c /dev/hda1 48090
[**********3 should this line be: "# mkfs -c /dev/hda2 48090" ?]

    Ah, finally.... you are ready to install to HD! Thanks to Jim
    Winstead's excellent installation scripts this is easy as pie so
    without further ado type the following

# mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[**********4 should this line be: "# mount /dev/hda2 /mnt" ?]

                    ******************************

        Again, thanks for the effort in making installation much easier...
I'm going to try Linux from floppy today, and will probably HD install
it as soon as I get positive replies to this message...

Even source files can be harmful.  Since make requires being su on some
people's systems (-:  and lots of superusers use vi vice emacs when
logged in as root need to watch out for things like hlu's latest GCC ---
there is a .exrc in 2.1ps.tar.Z This caused grief when I did my first
download via kermit under Linux as I lose/garbage 1 out of the last 9
bytes of a binary file [FEATURE of the download process thru a 36 bit
machine] The uncompress and tar left a bad .exrc file in the ps
directory There should be no reason to be including .exrc files in the
GCC

Subject: FAQ: gcc 2.1 and kernel
Date: Tue, 7 Apr 92 20:14:20 GMT

Hi,

There seems some confusion about how to use gcc 2.1 to compile 0.95a
kernel with Linus's second patch. That may be my fault. Ok. Here is the
new FAQ for gcc 2.1. Please save it. THE ONE ON FTP SITES IS NOT SO
CLEAR AS THIS ONE.


H.J.
==========FAQ FOE GCC 2.1====
QUESTION: Where is the gcc 2.1 beta?

ANSWER: It's on banjo.concert.net under /pub/Linux/GCC and
headrest.woz.colorado.edu under /pub/linux/gcc. You may find it on the
other sites. But I am not sure if they are up to date. There are two
files, 2.1lib.tar.Z and 2.1misc.tar.Z. Another file, binutils.tar.Z,
is not the part of gcc 2.1, but used by gcc 2.1. It contains all the
binary utilities you need to run gcc 2.1.

There may be also some files called 2.1shared-x.tar.Z. They have some
programs compiled in .a format. It has almost everything you want for
Linux. Please take a look at

        /usr/shared/obj/README*

after unpack 2.1shared-A.tar.Z under /usr.

QUESTION: What are the contents of them?

ANSWER: 2.1lib.tar.Z contains cc1, cc1plus and cpp. 2.1misc.tar.Z
contains gcc 2.1 drivers, header files, libraries, manual pages and
installation instructions.

QUESTION: How do I install it?

ANSWER: First of all, backup the old compiler if you have one and
remove it from your hard drive. YOU MUST BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THERE IS NO
ANY OTHER C COMPILER ON YOUR SYSTEM INSTALLED. I have heard too many
stories about it. By compiler, I mean the executables, libraries 
(crt0.o) and header files. This gcc 2.1 will only work with the kernel
above 0.95. You may have to have 2 MB ram to run it and have some swap
space (> 4MB) since cc1 and cc1plus are about 1 MB. First do

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/2.1misc.tar.Z

Then read FAQ in /usr/install/gcc2. After

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/2.1lib.tar.Z

run the shell script "inst2.x". If you need binutils.tar.Z, do a

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/binutils.tar.Z

Please check the file permission for all files you have unpacked. Maybe
I should write a shell script to do that.

QUESTION: How do I install a new release of gcc 2.1?

ANSWER: Depends on the nature of the new release, if the gcc itself is
changed, you have to install everything in 2.1lib.tar.Z and
2.1misc.tar.Z come with the new release. If just the libraries are
changed, you can just pick 2.1update.tar.Z and unpack it in /usr. Then
do

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/2.1update.tar.Z
        cd /usr/install/gcc2
        update2.x

In both cases, it is recommended to relink all the shared executables.
If the gcc itself is changed, a new set of .a's may be released too.

QUESTION: What are the main differences with the old release?

ANSWER: Here are the features

1. gcc and g++ are in one.

2. ANSI and BSD 4.4 compatible stdio.

3. iostream for g++. It has

* Full implementation of ANSI C stdio.
* Full implementation of the streambuf layer of AT&T's
  iostream library for C++.
* Full compatibility between stdio and streambufs.

and libg++.a 2.0.

4. Libc.a is almost new. Most of glibc.a 1.02 (nonnetwork stuffs) are 
here.

        a. ctype
        b. grp
        c. locale
        d. malloc (libmcheck.a)
        e. posix
        f. pwd
        g. stdlib
        h. string

Some other functions are added.

        b. cvt
        b. drand48
        c. getlogin (poeigl-1.2)
        d. getpass (poeigl-1.2)
        e. mkfifo (is that supported in kernel?)
        f. regex (GNU)
        g. curses (BSD)
        h. swab
        i. time (BSD, untested)
        j. ufc
        k. utmp stuffs (poeigl-1.2)

These old functions are not changed very much.

        a. soft math (fmod is added)
        b. math (some are new)
        c. termcap
        d. unistd

5. The shared libraries are here. To link with the static libraries,
add the -static flag to gcc.

QUESTION: Is stdio ANSI compatible?

ANSWER: Yes, please test it.

QUESTION: Is g++ in 2.1?

ANSWER: Yes. Use g++ to compile the C++ code. Libg++.a 2.0 is here.
One thing missing is curses. I will take a look if I have time. And
fix.o failed to compile. 

QUESTION: What options can I use for gcc?

ANSWER: Read manual page, gcc.ps or gcc.man. -O3, -O4, -O5 or even
higher should work with 2.1. -O3 is said to be the best. Don't ask me
why. Try it yourself. I was told you could manipulate those optimation
flags to get the best performance. Also -static tells gcc to use the
static libraries. The default is the shared libraries.

QUESTION: Where is the source code of the new libc.a?

ANSWER: The same place you find this file. It is called libc-2.1.tar.Z.

QUESTION: How can I use gcc 2.1 to compile the kernel?

ANSWER: The kernel has to be compiled with the header files come with
it. Please use my 2.1kernel.tar.Z and 2.1ps.tar.Z, which can be found
where you get gcc 2.1. The kernel uses its own header files. Do not
include any header files from gcc 2.1 while compiling the kernel.

QUESTION: Why does gcc say "foo.h not found" when compiling the
kernel and I am following the instructions above?

ANSWER: Not every source code under ./linux is kernel code. By kernel,
I mean those linked together and written to boot image. If there is a
file which is compiled to run under Linux, that is an application and
you should follow the instruction below. ./tools/build is one of them.
It should be compiled with gcc 2.1 header files. Please read my
2.1kernel.tar.Z.

QUESTION: How can I use gcc 2.1 to compile applications?

ANSWER: Any application has to be compiled with the header files come
with gcc 2.1. If you need some header files from the kernel sources,
do a

        #include "/foo/src/linux/include/linux/bar.h"

It is strongly recommended to prototype all the library functions by
including the appropriate head files. At least, it will save you
trouble of malloc (0) (read stdlib.h).

QUESTION: Why does a program compiled ok by gcc 2.1 and the new binary
utilities get an error from kernel saying something about binary file
format or some weird things?

ANSWER: Linux has changed a.out.h. The new a.out.h in Linus' second
patch is compatible with the applications compiled with the old
a.out.h. But if an application is compiled with the new ld
(binutils.tar.Z) which uses the new a.out.h, you have to use the
kernel compiled with the new a.out.h. You have to recompile the kernel
with Linus' second patch applied and old ld. And then use new ld to
link the programs.

QUESTION: Why does g++ complain even die?

ANSWER: You need "expr", which is in GNU shell utilities 1.6, echo (?)
and sed.

files, 2.1lib.tar.Z and 2.1misc.tar.Z. Another file, binutils.tar.Z,
is not the part of gcc 2.1, but used by gcc 2.1. It contains all the
binary utilities you need to run gcc 2.1.

There may be also some files called 2.1shared-x.tar.Z. They have some
programs compiled in .a format. It has almost everything you want for
Linux. Please take a look at

        /usr/shared/obj/README*

after unpack 2.1shared-A.tar.Z under /usr.

QUESTION: What are the contents of them?

ANSWER: 2.1lib.tar.Z contains cc1, cc1plus and cpp. 2.1misc.tar.Z
contains gcc 2.1 drivers, header files, libraries, manual pages and
installation instructions.

QUESTION: How do I install it?

ANSWER: First of all, backup the old compiler if you have one and
remove it from your hard drive. YOU MUST BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THERE IS NO
ANY OTHER C COMPILER ON YOUR SYSTEM INSTALLED. I have heard too many
stories about it. By compiler, I mean the executables, libraries 
(crt0.o) and header files. This gcc 2.1 will only work with the kernel
above 0.95. You may have to have 2 MB ram to run it and have some swap
space (> 4MB) since cc1 and cc1plus are about 1 MB. First do

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/2.1misc.tar.Z

Then read FAQ in /usr/install/gcc2. After

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/2.1lib.tar.Z

run the shell script "inst2.x". If you need binutils.tar.Z, do a

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/binutils.tar.Z

Please check the file permission for all files you have unpacked. Maybe
I should write a shell script to do that.

QUESTION: How do I install a new release of gcc 2.1?

ANSWER: Depends on the nature of the new release, if the gcc itself is
changed, you have to install everything in 2.1lib.tar.Z and
2.1misc.tar.Z come with the new release. If just the libraries are
changed, you can just pick 2.1update.tar.Z and unpack it in /usr. Then
do

        cd /usr
        tar xvpfvz xxxx/2.1update.tar.Z
        cd /usr/install/gcc2
        update2.x

In both cases, it is recommended to relink all the shared executables.
If the gcc itself is changed, a new set of .a's may be released too.

QUESTION: What are the main differences with the old release?

ANSWER: Here are the features

1. gcc and g++ are in one.

2. ANSI and BSD 4.4 compatible stdio.

3. iostream for g++. It has

* Full implementation of ANSI C stdio.
* Full implementation of the streambuf layer of AT&T's
  iostream library for C++.
* Full compatibility between stdio and streambufs.

and libg++.a 2.0.

4. Libc.a is almost new. Most of glibc.a 1.02 (nonnetwork stuffs) are 
here.

        a. ctype
        b. grp
        c. locale
        d. malloc (libmcheck.a)
        e. posix
        f. pwd
        g. stdlib
        h. string

Some other functions are added.

        b. cvt
        b. drand48
        c. getlogin (poeigl-1.2)
        d. getpass (poeigl-1.2)
        e. mkfifo (is that supported in kernel?)
        f. regex (GNU)
        g. curses (BSD)
        h. swab
        i. time (BSD, untested)
        j. ufc
        k. utmp stuffs (poeigl-1.2)

These old functions are not changed very much.

        a. soft math (fmod is added)
        b. math (some are new)
        c. termcap
        d. unistd

5. The shared libraries are here. To link with the static libraries,
add the -static flag to gcc.

QUESTION: Is stdio ANSI compatible?

ANSWER: Yes, please test it.

QUESTION: Is g++ in 2.1?

ANSWER: Yes. Use g++ to compile the C++ code. Libg++.a 2.0 is here.
One thing missing is curses. I will take a look if I have time. And
fix.o failed to compile. 

QUESTION: What options can I use for gcc?

ANSWER: Read manual page, gcc.ps or gcc.man. -O3, -O4, -O5 or even
higher should work with 2.1. -O3 is said to be the best. Don't ask me
why. Try it yourself. I was told you could manipulate those optimation
flags to get the best performance. Also -static tells gcc to use the
static libraries. The default is the shared libraries.

QUESTION: Where is the source code of the new libc.a?

ANSWER: The same place you find this file. It is called libc-2.1.tar.Z.

QUESTION: How can I use gcc 2.1 to compile the kernel?

ANSWER: The kernel has to be compiled with the header files come with
it. Please use my 2.1kernel.tar.Z and 2.1ps.tar.Z, which can be found
where you get gcc 2.1. The kernel uses its own header files. Do not
include any header files from gcc 2.1 while compiling the kernel.

QUESTION: Why does gcc say "foo.h not found" when compiling the
kernel and I am following the instructions above?

ANSWER: Not every source code under ./linux is kernel code. By kernel,
I mean those linked together and written to boot image. If there is a
file which is compiled to run under Linux, that is an application and
you should follow the instruction below. ./tools/build is one of them.
It should be compiled with gcc 2.1 header files. Please read my
2.1kernel.tar.Z.

QUESTION: How can I use gcc 2.1 to compile applications?

ANSWER: Any application has to be compiled with the header files come
with gcc 2.1. If you need some header files from the kernel sources,
do a

        #include "/foo/src/linux/include/linux/bar.h"

It is strongly recommended to prototype all the library functions by
including the appropriate head files. At least, it will save you
trouble of malloc (0) (read stdlib.h).

QUESTION: Why does a program compiled ok by gcc 2.1 and the new binary
utilities get an error from kernel saying something about binary file
format or some weird things?

ANSWER: Linux has changed a.out.h. The new a.out.h in Linus' second
patch is compatible with the applications compiled with the old
a.out.h. But if an application is compiled with the new ld
(binutils.tar.Z) which uses the new a.out.h, you have to use the
kernel compiled with the new a.out.h. You have to recompile the kernel
with Linus' second patch applied and old ld. And then use new ld to
link the programs.

QUESTION: Why does g++ complain even die?

ANSWER: You need "expr", which is in GNU shell utilities 1.6, echo (?)
and sed.
