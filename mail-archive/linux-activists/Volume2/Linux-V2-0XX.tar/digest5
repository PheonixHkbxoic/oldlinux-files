I'm about to take the plunge and replace MINIX with LINUX.  I am going to
have to repartition my hard drive and I need to have some idea of how to
calculate the size of a swap partition.  Does LINUX use the usual UNIX
strategy of mapping the available virtual memory onto the swap partition
so that the swap partition needs to be at least as large as the core memory
or does the swap partition merely hold VM pages which are not currently in
core.

Is a copy of /vmunix available somewhere, or does one have to compile it
from the sources?

I've noted that, when the backspace doesn't work under a VC with ash,
reseting the screen with setterm from another VC tends to fix the problem.
E.g., if you're having a problem under /dev/tty1, go into /dev/tty2 and
try
        setterm -reset > /dev/tty1

It's worked for me a few times.  Don't know why.

Subject: problems with IO after suspending process
Date: Wed, 1 Apr 1992 19:51:45 GMT

I've noticed the following annoying behavior with both elvis and
gnu-emacs when run from bash:  After suspending the process (via ^Z)
and then resuming it (with `fg') IO is all wrong.  Input isn't
recognized until a CR is sent.  This looks like a simple bug
concerning tty modes, but I don't really know anything about tty
modes.  (And I don't really believe in ``simple bugs''....)

I'm using the bash distributed with 0.12.  I haven't been able to find
a more recent version.

Last night I tracked this down to a bad 'as' (gas) in /usr/bin
(untarred from the newgcc.tar.Z file on tsx-11).  Although gcc just
says 'can't exec...', running 'as' directly gave a memory fault
(general protection error).  I tried untarring the file with the tar
from the 0.95a root floppy as well with the same result.  Unpacked on
a Sun-3, 'as' is the same size, but gives a different checksum.

This isn't really a solution - my plan is to carry the 'as' file
home separately tonight.

Given the number of bad file transfers people seem to encounter, maybe
something like 'zoo' that computes a checksum would be a better means
of doing the transfer, at least until 'tar' stabilizes.

LINUX ANSWER:   There is no support in LINUX for disk controllers at the
                secondary controller addresses (yet).  Care to write
                and debug it?

DOS ANSWER:     I got told by Hard Drives International that the only
                disk controller that would run with an MFM controller

                running an ESDI and an IDE concurrently, however.

                I suspect in reality that it is possible given the following
                conditions:

        1)  Run the IDE as the primary disk controller.
        2)  Setup the CMOS disk drive types to indicate the IDE drives ONLY.
            If only one IDE drive, set the second disk type to NOT INSTALLED.
        3)  Strap the MFM contoller to the secondary addresses.
            (This may not be possible on some MFM controllers.  If so, you are SOL)
        3a) If both disk controllers have floppy drive support,
            strap one or the other to the sencondary addresses, or disable one.
            (If this is not possible, then your floppies will NOT work right!)
        4)  Run the MFM via a device driver (software required under DOS).

I have not seen an IDE controller that can be addressed at the secondary
disk controller addresses.  If you can find one, you may be able to
swap the disk controllers listed above.

No, I do not know where to get the device driver software for the secondary
controller.

drive in my system.  (No configurable disk drive type in my disk table).

OK, I snarfed the installation files from TSX-11 and made a boot and a root 
diskette.  The boot diskette says Loading......., asks me what video mode I 
prefer, tells me I have N consoles, and then wanders off into the weeds 
never to return.  I'm doing this on a genuine IBM PS/2-70 E61 with the "
Integrated Hard Disk Adaptor".  My guess would be that this adaptor is the 
problem since the last visible activity was some sort of hard-disk action.  
Any hints would be welcome.

No.  You can run Linux without any swap space.  Swap space expands
your available VM -- you don't need to start by allocating the same
amount of physical memory.  However it's probably still a good idea to
have at least that much swap space.

If you have 4MB of memory you may be able to exist with no swap space
at all.  C may run out of memory, but I actually managed to recompile
the kernel on a 4MB machine with no swapping.  However I think most
people recommend that you have at least some swap space available.

Linux DOES NOT support MCA machines, only ISA ones as fasr as I know.  Looks

A bootable kernel is available that supports Seagate and Ultrastor host
adapters.  Tommy Thorn (Many Thanks!) has finished the Adaptec low level driver

Extended DOS answer : An XT type disk controller with BIOS onboard will
coexist with a "normal" WD1003 compatble IDE, ESDI, MFM, RLL, etc controller.
Note that you will not be able to use such a controller under Linux, which
expects an AT compatable controller of some sort.

Be CAREFUL, however.  Some SCSI adaptors emulate IDE BIOS functions, and will
cause problems.  Further, some SCSI adaptors (like my Mylex) emulate IDE
HARDWARE.  I tried to add an IDE drive to my system, and I can tell you from
experience that two devices on the bus, both responding to and sending out
the same hardware signals, is not too good for your data.  Nothing was
physically damaged, but I lost 420Mb of data (backed up) and frightened 
myself, because it took 3 days of experimenting with various utilities to
get back the partition table on a SCSI drive that can't be low-level formatted.
