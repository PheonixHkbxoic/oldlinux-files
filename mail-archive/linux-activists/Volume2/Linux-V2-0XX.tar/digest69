Well, since you ask:-)
Some of you may remember my whining and complaining a while back about
not being able to get 2.1 to work. It ended up being a bogus copy of
tar from the 95a distribution. After fixing this I've no trouble at
all compiling .95c+ and other applications. If anyone is looking for
votes I think going with 2.1 is a great idea. I'm really looking
forward to converting my stuff to shared libs.

To the people (person) working on 2.1: Thanks, and good work!

I ftp'd the boot/root/rawrite.c/FAQ/REL images down (remembering to

to bring them down to my DOS machine.  FTP site was tsx-11.mit.edu

size blocks on my machine).  I tried both kermit and umodem to
get the uncompressed files down to my machine with no differences.
I formatted a 5.25 floppy and verified it really had 1.2M of

I also just successfully installed a complete 0.95c+/gcc2.1 system via this
method but I used the command line:

        tar xvpz </dev/PS0

I am just about finished with linking everything in 2.1shared-A.tar.Z with
shared libs and symlinking into /usr/bin.  A word of caution, DON'T use
shared libs or symlinks on anything in /bin or /etc if / and /usr are on
different partitions.  They won't work until /usr is mounted.  Keep a good
bootimage floppy and root floppy handy just in case.

   It seems that gcc 2.1 can run with 2MB RAM. I think it's the time we
   retire gcc 1.40. Lots of problems about kernel and gcc 2.1 are related
   to the old gcc 1.40. With gcc 2.1, we can use the shared libs as the
   standard. So we can squeeze more stuffs into rootimage. I really miss
   bash. I had to copy it from 0.12 rootimage.

Please, don't consider 1.40 retired -- It is smaller -- Not all the
features, and I am _very_ glad that 2.x is out, and I am sure that I
will switch some day.  But right now I want something small, and I
simply don't yet need 2.x's features.  I don't think that I am
alone...

When there is a _reason_ to switch (like there is a feature of 2.x
that will help kernel development, or something like that) then let's
"retire" 1.40

My $.01 cent worth.  Ok, my $005 cent worth ;-)

That's not a file system problem, it's a SCSI driver thing

Only the kernel is scheduled when Linux is in the strategy routine
of a device driver.  

With the SCSI drivers, there are two possible interfaces between
the midlevel driver and the lowlevel host specific driver.  One 
provides a generic interupt driven interface, and expects that a 
completion function will be called when the SCSI host is done doing
its thing, and that the command function will return immediately,
allowing the strategy routine in sd.c to exit immediately,
and other tasks to be scheduled.  With this interface, 
you won't have that problem.

The other interface is mostly there to ease development,
and to support brain dead hardware that 
can't cope with interrupts well.  It
calls a command function that doesn't exit until
command completion.  

Since the command() is called 
from scsi_do_cmnd(), which is called from the strategy routine
of the sd driver, when this interface to the SCSI drivers is used,
the strategy routine doesn't exit until the command completes,
and user tasks aren't scheduled until exit.

On the Adaptec drivers, code is there supporting the queue_command()
interface, but there are bugs in the {compiler, kernel, adaptec low level driver
, midlevel SCSI driver, gcc} that keep it from working correctly.  

The Seagate adapters have severe hardware restrictions that 
led to me to use the command() interface.  

I think 
the current Ultrastor driver used this approach for ease 
of development, and in anticipation of the new interface 
designed to work with multiple outstanding commands, 
out there because of multiple devices and disconnect / reconnect,
the support for multiple outstanding commands for a single LUN
under SCSI2, and inteligent host adapters that queue commands 
internally and send them out in an optimal order.

So - no one has done much work with the queue_command() interface,
and since there are no other implementations other than
the one in the Adaptec driver, I can't tell if the bug
is there, in my code, the reset of the kernel, etc.

This situation will be rectified permanantly when 
1.  Some one else takes care of it.

2.  Some one donates / loans me a better SCSI host more friendly 
        to this interface,  like an Adaptec, with
        full technical documentation. 

3.  I get time to implement a hack to deal with the seagate 
        hardware in this mode, which means either 
        disconnecting and reconnecting on an interrupt
        (which can only be triggered by a device on
        the BUS asserting SEL),
        and personally starting to use queue_command(), 
        or doing something more bletcherous.

        
A temporary fix may be to call schedule() from 
within the wait loop in the low level driver, but 
I haven't looked at the side effects this will have.

Linus?

   Thanks for the tex-info^2. Two more questions:

   1) Can texinfo documents (if that's the word) be created using LaTeX, of
   is raw TeX necessary? 2) I assume Texinfo has been ported to Linux; where
   is it?

Neither is needed -- All texinfo is done with fairly simply
@-commands, with the exception of a
/input texinfo.tex
at the beginning of the texinfo file to bootstrap tex to understand
the @-commands.  It is _much_ _much_ easier, in my opinion, to use
texinfo than TeX/LaTeX, and I have use LaTeX to create answer keys
math classes, etc.  It was hellish -- Not that TeX was bad, but that
there is just so much to learn, and I can't afford either Knuth's or
Lamport's books right now.  Texinfo has a free manual (written in
texinfo, of course :-) and is quite easy to use, especially if you are
used to @commands and/or "intentional formatting."

It _is_ possible to include raw TeX code if you _really_ want to, but
there doesn't generally seem to be a lot of call for that, as in I
have not seen a reason to do it yet.

The manual and all necessary things, including an info browser
(program to display info files, the on-line versions of texinfo files)
written in c, are available from ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu.  Look
under texinfo*.

If you want to print off the documentation, I can give a few hints --
The first of which is that it is about 150 pages, as I recall.  It is
also possible to order it from the FSF for $10-15, I think.

If you copy the shared lib to /lib instead of symlinking it (done by the 
install script) you can use shared binaries in /bin and /etc.  You can also 
safely remove /usr/shared the next time you upgrade libraries.  It's still 
a good idea to have "emergency" boot and root floppies handy however.

LOCK_FILE should be PASSWD_LOCK.  There is also a bug in chsh/passwd.
Chsh/passwd makes it's changes in /etc/passwd~, then copies the changes

The kernel headers and GCC 2.1 headers don't mix very well yet.  Hopefully

This is a mistake on my part - I changed LOCK_FILE to PASSWD_LOCK, and
forgot to make sure I changed it everywhere.  The fix is to change
LOCK_FILE to PASSWD_LOCK in that line.

I don't know what's causing this....
