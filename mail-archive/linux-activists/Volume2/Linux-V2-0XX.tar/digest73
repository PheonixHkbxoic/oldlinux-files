before you lose all your hair...the problem is presumably that TIOCLINUX is
defined in /usr/src/linux/include/termios.h, but not in the termios.h provided
with gcc2.1. I've been using gcc1.4, and just copying all the kernel include
files into /usr/include. A quick fix would be to copy the definition into
/usr/include/termios.h, or if you don't think it should be there, put
something like

    #ifndef TIOCLINUX
    #define TIOCLINUX       0x541C
    #endif

near the top of stuff.c.

Could someone please point me to an FAQ or some kind of summary on
what Linux is and what it runs on?

I've been hearing very good things about it and am looking at running
Linux or BSD386 in the near future.

My current configuration is a 386/33Mhz with a 387, ESDI, 670+MB disk,
8Meg of memory, ET4000 + color monitor. I'm interested in getting the
gcc2.1 compilers (gcc, g++, ObjectiveC) up and running as well as the
X11R5 release on my 386. Is Linux the way to go?

Is it stable enough to be used for heavy duty development work? What
about mail/news with high-speed modems and serial ports? Does anyone
have FAS working on Linux?

Please Email responses and I'll summarize if there's enough interest.

        We have some large binary sound files which we read into RAM from
disk and then send to a ADC/DAC board to drive a speaker.
        Under DOS we disable most of the system interupts during this
process to prevent artifact on the replayed signal.
        What would be the effect of transiently disabling interupts in 
this way under Linux? (would it crash the system/do terribler irrepairable
harm ?)
p.s. we retain one or two of the interupts even under DOS but they do not
seem to do any harm to the replayed signal.

And perhaps some co-ordination regarding patches.  Perhaps a few persons
would take each patch, and compare it to some "standard" source tree.

I have used Minix a bit, but haven't installed Linux (yet), but I'd
hate to see the "patch-mess", that minix has gotten into, hit Linux as
well.

Reply-To: u31b3hs@messua.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (Michael Haardt)

I ported dmake 3.8 to get a decent make on Linux (it compiles without
much effort, as usual on Linux) and built my small transputer tools a
few minutes ago.

Well, I started the transputer memory test with the start server and:
wow! It worked, and *so* much faster than under MINIX.  This simple
server uses /dev/port, and it was painful slow under MINIX.  Once again
I am really impressed by the speed of Linux.

I am still working on my transputer assembler and linker and I am still
not sure if I will release it to public domain, but if there is
interest, I will make binaries for Linux available per ftp.  I can't
make available the server, because it is a based on the server in "Das
Transputerbuch", but I will write my own server next time.

I will be away for vacation with my gf during next month.  When I come
back, I will develop a concept for a device driver to use the link
interface at highest possible speed.  I guess that the PC bus will be
the bottleneck, because the link is able to work at 20 MBit/second, but
it is used via an 8 bit port.  Here are two ideas of mine:

-   /dev/tlink, a character device with blocking read and write to the
    link.  Perhaps non blocking read/write may be supported, I don't know
    if it is useful.  ioctl's will control reset, error and analyse.

-   /dev/tlink for the link, /dev/tlinkctl for controlling error, reset and
    analyse with kind of message passing via fs.  This makes ioctl obsolete
    and I like it a lot since I read the Plan 9 papers, but on the other
    side it is totally different from anything else in Linux :(

Any other suggestions?

I haven't looked at device drivers in Linux yet, how difficult it will
be and what has to be done to support blocking/non blocking operations.

The transputer should be fast enough to use polling without loosing
performance.  I think the overhead of interrupts would even slow down
the data transfer, but I have no practical experience in that.

I also thought about a lock to allow only one process to deal with
/dev/tlink in the way like Parsytec uses semaphores for OpenLink, but I
decided to let the server program deal with that.  People who open
devices in their programs should know what they do and no restrictions
should be put on them.

If you post follow-ups, please send me a copy per email during next
month.  I will post a summary.

I also would like to see simpler graphics support.  I really don't
want to clobber by system with X, and all I really need can be
provided much more simply.  First, I'd like to have downloadable
character sets, so I can use the Hebrew routines I've been using under
DOS.  Second, I'd like a .dvi previewer.  So far, I've seen nothing
that's even nearly as good as the .dvi drivers that come with emTeX.
Any chance of porting those??  (E. Mattes?  Please!)  Finally,
sometime down the road I'd like to see a full DOS emulator for Linux,
and that will require graphics support.  

It seems to me a ggod approach would be to emulate DOS's graphics
interface, and trap the reads and writes to the graphics card.  That
would make all of the above tasks much easier, and wouldn't demand so
much of the system.

Comments?

p.s.  Please don't write back telling me how terrible DOS is.  I have

The bootimage-0.95c+.scsi at nic.funet.fi is corrupt. The offset 508 and
509 ( in the bootsector )is supposed to be 00 00 if you want to load Linux
from floppies. As I have an Adaptec drive this was the first chance for Linux 
to read my HD. Linux didn't found any root in the device 03 01(offset 509 and 
508 in my image originally). Well, it worked find when I corrected the mistake.
I guess the pearson who did send the image was tired and didn't remember to 
change these bits.

Good news.  I had thought about this and will very likely do it.  With only
a 4 Meg root partition, I ran out of space attempting to install the shadow
passwd utilities.  Converting all binaries in the root partition to shared
libs will save lots of space.  Now I just need to go back and grab the src
for the shadow stuff to compile and link it for shared libs.  I assume I
should also cp the shared binaries into /usr/bin rather than using symlinks
to /usr/shared/bin.

Hi everyone,

I will be doing a project involving the implementation of 
"loadable device drivers" in linux. This will facilitate developing
new device drivers: you should be able to:

gcc device.driver.c
unloaddevice <major>
loaddevice a.out b <major>

/etc/mount /dev/<myblockdev> /mnt

If anybody has suggestions, they are welcome. One thing though:
please don't tell me that you've done this already... I'd have to
go looking for another project.

Perhaps you're assuming he doesn't want to compile it :-)
 
According to the docs in the R5 distribution, the source tree untars to
roughly 150-200 Megs.  To compile, expect to need at least another 100Meg.
 
As far as compiled binaries go, using shared libraries, on a Sun i386,
the full MIT core plus about 50% again in added-on goodies takes somewhere
in the range of 60-70 Megs.  Of course, to simply run R5 'functional', then,
yes, expect to use ~20 megs.  Perhaps even a bit less if you only have one
WM on call...

Add to that the far superior compiler error messages that 2.1 gives etc etc. I
don't want to see 1.40 retired since itr is a first class compiler in its own
right but I would suggest using 2.1 as the default kernel compiler with options
(easily configured) to allow a kernel rebuild with 1.40.
