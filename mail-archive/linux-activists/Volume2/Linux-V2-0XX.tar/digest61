Being the owner of a brand spanking new Diamond Stealth VRAM S3 based video

Great news!  Maybe I should order up a copy, since Diamond doesn't provide
access to ALL the S3 supported modes in it's video BIOS.  On the other hand,
Diamond does provide a VESA BIOS, but it doesn't support all the S3 modes either.

So far, all this is pretty S3 standard, the Diamond supports these refresh rates
as well.

The Stealth only has 4 swithches on the back of its card.  Two of them help
select refresh rates.  I guess I'm lucky.  Two of these four states support the
NEC 3 and NEC 4/5 series monitors (I have a NEC 3D).

Yes, agreed, however, if we can figure out what the BIOSes are doing when they set
modes, maybe we can duplicate some of that in protected mode code so we don't need
the BIOSes (they're hard to access once LINUX gets running!).

Uh, BIOS interfaces are probably card specific, though VESA support can help here.
As far as card interfaces, 8, 16, and 32 bits are all possible.  My card is a 16 bit
card with jumpers on board to restrict access to 8 bits if necessary (not recommended
in an AT+ class machine!).

100% false with ISA.  ISA interrupts are edge triggered.  It has nothing
to do with the ICU not letting you have multiple interrupts.  The ISA 
IRQ lines are tristated, and if more than one is enabled at a time,
they short each other out.  Not as bad as it sounds, but it doesn't 
work.  

You are correct about MCA though - it uses level active IRQ lines,
and they are open collector.

It was pretty easy for me.  First off there are two ways to set up
swap space.  You can create a swap file in your file system and page to it, or
you can set aside a disk partition, and page to that.  I choose the latter.

Step 1) Using pfdisk, I made the disk partition.  It was a little difficult
        finding the right fdisk to figure out the exact device name to use,
        but a little common sense came through in the end.  For me /dev/hda1
        is my primary DOS partition, and /dev/hda2 is my extended DOS partition.
        Using pfdisk, I set up partitions 3 and 4 and labeled them as
        type Linux/Minix file-system, and Linux-swap partitions.  The latter
        wasn't really necessary, I could have labeled it as anything.
        So, I have LINUX root on /dev/hda3, and LINUX swap on /dev/hda4.
        (If you already have LINUX on your hard drive, you only have to setup
        your swap partition.  I just happened to do both at the same time.)

Step 2) I ran "mkswap -c /dev/hda4 xxxx" where xxxx is the amount of space
        reported by fdisk as being available on the device.  The -c
        tells mkswap to check the media for bad spots (unrecoverable errors).
        You don't want to page onto one of those!

Step 3) After the partition is ready for swapping, I turned it on via
        "swapon /dev/hda4" to see if there would be any problems and ran that
        way for a while.

Step 4) To make the swap area appear permanently in my system, I modifed /etc/rc
        to do the swapon for me during system boot.

The prcedure for a file system swap file is similar to the above, except that the
swap device being used by the mkswap and swapon commands is a file instead of
a device.  Create a file big enough to hold the amount of swap space you want,
and use that pathname in place of /dev/hdax in the above sequence.

I don't know, I used the one on my root disk without problems.

Like I said above, the -c causes a media check for bad spots.

mkswap configures the disk for swapping.  (Like mkfs configures a disk
to be used as a file system.)  swappon is the command which actually
tells the OS to use the new swap space.

Under SUNOS, they have a mkfile command.  I haven't seen one for LINUX yet.

>               * Do I need to have more space than the #blocks I tell mkswap?

Nope, but if you have more space than you've configured with mkswap, it'll never
get used.

So swapping swaps 1K bytes at a time.  That is a memory page size.

>       * Is there any way to tell how much swap space you are using or
> have left?

Under SUNOS I do a "pstst -T".  I haven't seen a LINUX command yet to tell me
how much is actually in use.  And seeing as gcc-1.4 didn't know when my disk
was full (other that getting unexpected EOF error messages during compiliation),
I wouldn't be surprised if LINUX doesn't detect "out of swap space" cleanly either.
For now, I hope that 4MB of memory and 9MB of swap space is enough to not run out of
until we get something that tells us swap usage.

        The help output is through stderr insted of stdio (why?)  If you
want to pipe stderr, use the amperstand (&).  For example: tar &> tar.help.
Then more the tar.help file.  For some reason, stderr pipes aren't supported
with bash.  You should be able to do a &| to pipe the output directly to
more in the first place.

        Sync flushes the disk cache.  Very important!  Most modern drives
auto-park on powerdown.

Better yet, go find 0.95c or 0.95c+.  This was supposed to fixed
the uncommon reset floppy problem that only a few people had.

Actually, standard error pipes are supported by bash.  You just have to use
the traditional /bin/sh syntax like this:

        command1 2>&1 | command2

   Could anyone explain me the difference of architecture between Linux, Mach and
   Minix ? What makes Linux be so fast ? 

   Thanks for your answers....

Subject: Patching Bootimage disks
Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 21:06:43 GMT

I got pmk32.zip from wuarchive.wustl.edu in order to patch my boot-disk to 
tell about an alternative root device. (Wanting to change bytes no. 508 and 
509).
But: It did not work. I checked the behaviour of pmk with the new formatted 
disk - all ok. It seems, that the data of the boot information is too 
different from that of an ordinary MS/DOS disk. So a "General disk error" is 
reported.
Can anyone tell me an alternative mechanism for patching boot-disks?

Many thanks in advance!

Linux 0.95c is still in the period of development.
Everything is rather unstable.
when will Linux 1.0 come to the PC 386/486 world ?
