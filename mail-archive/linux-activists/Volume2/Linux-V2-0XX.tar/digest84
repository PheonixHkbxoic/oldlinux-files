Hi all,

 Can somebody out there with a working 'expr' and 'tr' e-mail me a
copy? I am using 0.95c+ and g++ complains that it cannot find 'expr'.
Some other programs, I tried to install, are missing 'tr'.

Just the executables (using either static or shared libraries) would be fine.

Tnanks in advance,

I dont intend on making a local only system. What I do want to avoid is the
system requirements of X. I dont think there are any X telnet programs for
the 286. I already have an application, and Unix would be a good multi-user
platform for it, but it requires characterset based graphics.

Just a suggestion... perhaps it might make sense, with all the
keyboard kernel patches going around, to make a system call that
dynamically modifies the keyboard xlation table on the fly. That
way, somebody could write a nice user-friendly utility that edits
and loads up keyboard tables...

Perhaps the slowness involves the drive's own internal 'translation mode'
operations?  I run MWC COHERENT with a Seagate IDE drive and it works
very speedily.  I will get LINUX 0.95c+ up and running as soon as I find
the time and energy and run similar tests.

Are you using the drive in its native or translation mode?

Subject: timezone support, date, CMOS clock support: archive sites please note
Date: 18 Apr 92 23:22:13 GMT

I've just put some stuff in /pub/linux on cs.rutgers.edu.  I'd appreciate
it if the archive sites would install in an appropriate place:

  timebin.tar.Z - date, clock, /usr/lib/zoneinfo
  timesrc.tar.Z - source for clock, zic, timezone files
  time.doc - documentation for the above (this is also included in timebin)

This supercedes the date stuff I put out a month or two ago for gcc
1.4.  Probably it should be integrated into the gcc 2.1 distribution
as part of the libraries.

These files are intended to be used with the gcc 2.1 libc.  That libc
has the necessary library routines to handle time zones, but without
the files included here, the code won't do anything.  I believe
everything except clock is from Gnu.  I wrote clock.

I have included a new copy of date, built from the Gnu shellutils 1.6.
(I didn't include it in timesrc, since it's the straight Gnu code.)
There's nothing special about this date, but you need a date that's
built with the 2.1 libc, and this is.

I have included a new program, clock.  This will set or read the
hardware (CMOS) clock.  Currently there is no way to set the CMOS
clock.  I had patched the kernel so that setting the Unix time also
set the CMOS clock.  However Linus didn't want to take the patch.
Indeed he wants to get rid of the code currently in the kernel that
initializes the Unix clock from the CMOS clock.  He feels (correctly,
I think) that the kernel shouldn't need code that duplicates the time
zone stuff in libc.  The idea is that you put a call to clock in
/etc/rc to initialize the Unix clock from the CMOS clock.  You can
also call it with another argument to set the CMOS clock from the Unix
clock.

Note that clock uses /dev/port to play with the CMOS clock.  Since
/dev/port may not be writeable by users, clock should probably be made
setuid.  It contains its own check to make sure that only root can
change the time (though it doesn't protect the CMOS clock -- this is
consistent with DOS behavior, under which there is no protection.  If
you want only root to be able to change the CMOS clock, don't install
this setuid.)  I considered putting the CMOS stuff into date.  However
this seems a violation of the Unix design philosophy.  It would have
added several extra options to date, and I couldn't figure out any way
of making it very clean.

Here's time.doc, which explains stuff in more detail:

=====================================================
Setting up time and time zones

There are several things involved in getting time right under Linux:

  - /usr/lib/zoneinfo contains files that define what time zone you
        are in.  If they are missing, no time zone calculations
        are done, i.e. your internal clock is assumed to be on
        local time rather than the Unix standard of GMT.  The only
        file that you absolutely need is /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime, but I
        recommend also having /usr/lib/zoneinfo/posixrules.  Posixrules
        is typically a copy of or link to localtime.  Localtime defines
        your default zone.  Posixrules is needed to interpret the TZ 
        variable, which is used if you want to specify a zone other than 
        the default.

  - the "date" command can be used to set or display the date/time.
        Note however that it does not set the hardware clock, so
        next time you reboot, you'll be back to the old time.
        I recommend that after changing the time with "date", you
        use "clock -w" or "clock -u -w" to update the hardware clock
        as well.  (See below.)

  - the "clock" command can be used to set or display the date/time
        in the hardware (CMOS) clock.  Typically your /etc/rc script
        will contain
                clock -s
        which will cause the Unix date/time to be initialized from the 
        CMOS clock when you boot.  If your CMOS clock is set to GMT
        (which is what I recommend) the correct command is
                clock -u -s

The binary time distribution should be untarred under /usr.  It
contains lib/zoneinfo, bin/date, bin/clock, and doc/time.doc (this
file).  Once you've installed these files, you'll want to do four
things:

1) set /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime and /usr/lib/zoneinfo/posixrules.
You should copy the file for your time zone.  E.g. if you are in the
U.S.  Eastern time zone, do

   cd /usr/lib/zoneinfo
   cp US/Eastern localtime
   ln localtime posixrules

Localtime defines the local time zone.  Posixrules defines the zone to
be used to interpret the TZ environment variable.  Since it's far more
convenient simply to use the right time zone file, nothing more will
be said here about how the TZ variable is used.  Unless you intend to
use TZ, you can ignore the next paragraph.

If you want exact POSIX behavior, posixrules should be a copy of or
link to one of the U.S. time zone files.  (For non-U.S. daylight
rules, the TZ variable defines the daylight transition rules.)
However it may make more sense practically for it to be the same as
localtime, as shown in the instructions above.

2) Once you've set up localtime and posixrules, you can remove the
rest of the files in /usr/lib/zoneinfo, if you're sure you'll never
want to operate in any other time zone.  Or you can keep just the few
time zones that you might need.

3) Put the correct "clock" command into /etc/rc.  Which command to use
depends upon whether you want your hardware clock to keep local time
or GMT.  I recommend using GMT, since that will allow daylight savings
transitions to be completely automatic.  However the same clock is
used by DOS, and some people don't like the time in DOS being GMT.  I
use Unix-compatible software under DOS.  It uses the TZ environment
variable to do time zone conversion.  Thus I prefer the clock being
GMT even under DOS.  But some people may not like that.  Anyway, if
your hardware clock is set to the local time, put the line

   clock -s

in /etc/rc.  This will set the Unix time from your hardware clock,
doing the necessary time conversion.  If your hardware clock is set 
to GMT, then you'll need the -u option:

   clock -u -s

4) Now make sure that your hardware clock is set correctly.  Try
"clock" with no arguments.  It will print the current setting of the
hardware clock.  Make sure it is right, and that it is either local or
GMT, as you decided.  (If the hardware clock is supposed to be GMT,
you can use "clock -u".  This will convert from GMT to local and
display it.)  To set the clock, first use the "date" command to get
the date right in Unix.  Then use "clock -w" to set the hardware
clock.  Note that "clock -w" will set the hardware clock to the local
time, and "clock -u -w" will set it to GMT.  Verify with "clock" that
the hardware clock is as you want it.

From now on, the time should be right.  If your hardware clock loses
or gains time, you can update it at a future date by the same
procedure just described: first get the Unix time right using "date"
and then use "clock -w" or "clock -u -w" to set the hardware clock.

If your hardware clock is set using local time, make sure to reset it
when daylight time changes.  If you're running Unix when daylight time
changes, the Unix time will adjust automatically.  In that case, all
you need is "clock -w" to update the hardware clock.  If you aren't
running Unix during the transition, then your time will be an hour off
the next time you boot.  In that case, set the correct Unix time using
"date", and then use "clock -w" to update the hardware clock.  If your
hardware clock is set using GMT time, none of this is necessary --
daylight time transitions will happen automatically.

But isn't head parking suggested only before moving the computer or the
disk itself? Although there is a greater possibility for disk damage
when the heads stay above the disk on power-down, it isn't a problem in
practise on everyday desk-top use.

For what it's worth, I just tried the same test you did,

  cp /dev/kmem /mnt/kmem.dump

It took me about 40 sec (note that it takes about 5 sec beyond when
the cp returns, because of buffering).  I ended up with a slightly
larger file than you, 4.5M.  Copying it to another partition took
1 min, 20 sec. I also tried

  cp /mnt/kmem.dump /dev/null

It took 12 sec.  That's certainly not up to a Sparcstation 2, but for
a 386sx on an AT bus, I think it's fine.  This is with the new Connor
510MB IDE drive, which I believe has very fast seek time.  I would
expect that copying partitions would be primarily an issue of seek,
and how well the OS optimizes things, not transfer rate.  Indeed
probably only the read time (cp into /dev/null) is dominated by
transfer rate.

Unfortunately I don't have an MFM drive to compare with.  My machine
can't handle more than one drive at a time.  I also can't tell you
much about the hardware.  I depend upon a local PC dealer to do
sensible things with controllers, etc.  I only claim to know about
software.  (I realize that a 500MB IDE disk is sort of wierd.  I
intentionally avoided SCSI because I wanted to be able to play with
OS's, and generally IDE is more likely to be supported.)

In all fairness, the majority of Sys V/386's have ranlib built into ar, so
ranlib doesn't exist on those systems.
