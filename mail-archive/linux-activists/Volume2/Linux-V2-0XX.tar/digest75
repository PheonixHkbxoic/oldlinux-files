Hello!
I'm running linux 0.95c+ and have been working on connecting up my printer
(Panasonic KXP-1123).
When I tried 
/bin/mknod /dev/lp1 c 6 0
I got a 'device not found' error (to that effect)
using 
/bin/mknod /dev/lp1 c 6 1
I was able to print to stuff, but I lost a lot of character in the printout
(about one in every three or four).

Suggestions anyone?

I plan on trying to run X over a slip connection to a "mainframe" host.
What I need locally is the local server, and maybe a few local
applications (a window manager, xterm, xmh, etc).  Most of the
other applications don't need to be local, but instead can run
from remote hosts.  I'm hoping that this is the 20MB scenario.  In fact
I'm willing to go to 40 or 50MB locally in this scenario.  I'm not
interested in compiling ALL of the X distribution, but I imagine that
there will be a fair number of people out there who will want to, mostly
because they won't have a live network connection, and will need to have
everything locally.

Use ranlib before linking.

Should that be in FAQ? I thought everybody knows it.

Date: Wed, 15 Apr 92 20:38:47 GMT

I have found that when I am rebuilding the kernel and downloading from
an xcomm session I get constant HD timeout errors from the download session
using rz.

Is this some sort of buffer problem or what?  And is it fixable?

These is an expr.a in the /usr/shared/obj directory of the 2.1shared-A.tar
file that is kinda part of gcc 2.1.  Finish loading it on your
machine and install it along with your 2.1 shared library.

Reply-To: V5068U%TEMPLEVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu

This is an updated version of su that handles encrypted passwords.
It requires that you have the libufc.a from poeigl1.2 (poe init-getty-login)
installed in /usr/lib.

The reason the old su did not handle setgid properly is because
the syntax of chmod is (still) broken - a+sg causes the error
``invalid mode''! And, being a DOS weenie, i did not realize that
chmod 7555 accomplished the same end.

Please note that the source is derived from Berserkely code and is
therefore covered under their copyleft.

Also note the shell defaults to /bin/sh. This will be fixed after school
lets off^H^Hut.

Well I just spent a pile of time trying to install 95a onto my hardrive
becasue I thought t was a IDE drive. After getting nothing but error 2's for
mount, I asked my officemate, and he said the drive type was ESDI. Is there
anything I can do to use this drive?

Look in patches/selection-1.0.tar.Z on tsx-11 for a package that implements
this, at least for serial mice, I think.  Improved version on the way,
allowing selection by word and line.

I am a new user to Linux. I have gotten 95a images onto 1.2 diskettes, installed
the root image on my harddrive. Works great. But now I want to install GCC,
Mtools and other usr utilities into Linux partition.  I am working from an-
other PC using MS/DOS to ftp archives to my site.  How do I prepare diskettes
that linux will read and mount so I can install all these unix files?
   
With Linux, I was using rawrite to create diskettes from 'image' files.
Now I have unix file archives (tar) and don't know how to move them to Linux.
Can someone point me in the right direction?  The issue is moving unix
archives on an MS/DOS system to the Linux system.  
 
Thanks in advance.

Ok, here goes:
I had xcomm, it was running fine.  suddenly, it started outputting to the
screen 2 cr/lf for every one I hit on the keyboard.  I went into kermit
to see if it was xcomm, or the place I  am calling.  kermit was doing
this:
C-Kermit>set line /dev/ttys4

C-kermit> set speed 2400

/dev/ttys4, 2400 baud
C-Kermit> set parity none

C-Kermit>connect

(note all the double line-feeds above)
once connected though, kermit does allright.
on the other hand, xcomm does allright offline, but double line on-line
(kermit fine on-line, messed up off-line)
I am writing this using xcomm(difficult to do with double spacing)
note also that the output that the attmail service sees is good.
I think I may have screwed up the termcap or something(?)
If anyone at all can help, please do, this is getting unbearable.
I have rebooted a dozen times, gone to various versions, and nothing changes.
Please Help Me someone!!  
thanks in advance,

Date: 15 Apr 92 23:15:48 GMT

I just uploaded configc+.tar.Z to tsx-11.mit.edu.  It should appear
in a few hours, and it includes:

        An improved configuration system which allows the specification
of arbitary constants in the devs.conf file.

        The kernel debugger.

        The new keyboard driver which has provisions for remapping keys.

        A wd8003 ethernet driver.

        most of what you need to get ka9q working with the ethernet driver.

If anyone wants to write documentation, or wants to write programs to
use some of the new features of the keyboard driver, send me some
email.

I have 2 ESDI drives and I have successfully installed 0.95a by way of
the installation notes..  Make sure you do your pfdisk'ing' properly by
defining your hard disk geometry...  I also have been successful
installing the 0.95c+ source and recompiling the kernel..  Very little
problems...

Good luck

Date: 16 Apr 92 00:55:02 GMT

Just a quick message to say I just patched the kernel diffs for selection into
0.95c+ (did them by hand and they weren't difficult), rebuilt the kernel (using
gcc 2.1) and rebuilt selection (just for good measure) and then, running the
new kernel I tried it all. Nothing. Not a thing. I know that the serial port
code shares interrupts between com1 (mouse) and com3 (modem). Is it possible
that nothing is getting through because of this? Just thought I'd check before
delving into the depths of things :-(
