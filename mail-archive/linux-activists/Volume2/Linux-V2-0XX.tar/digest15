Adaptec support in the generic SCSI package is "RSN" - I have Tommy's driver

this weekend.  Currently, the SCSI distribution only comes with 
Ultrastor 14f and Seagate ST01/02 support.

If you want to be immediately aware of any changes, new revisions, etc of
the SCSI support, subscribe to the linux-scsi mailing list.

An archive of the latest SCSI distribution is maintained at the same

It's not due to some internal linux-design: linux does count on a 386+
processor, but there isn't any heavy kernel dependancy on the AT-bus. 
HOWEVER: most device driver will probably have to be changed to some
degree, but I haven't got the slightest idea of what is needed. 

The minimum needed to make a PS/2 port is a very thorough knowledge of
the interrupt and IO system of the MCA systems, as well as patience and
a feel for kernel programming (debugging is /hell/ when nothing works -
no debugger I know of can follow the code from real mode to protected
mode and paging-setup etc - you'd probably need an emulator).  I can
help with questions about the current code, but I have /no/ idea of what
the microchannel architecture changed with respect to the ISA standard,
so you are essentially on your own in that respect.  I assume DMA, A20
etc have changed - I know the keyboard seems to work differently etc...

I am having the same problem.  A couple little programs that

What should the permissions bits be set to for make?  I used to get an error:
make: setuid: not owner (or something like that), now I get make:
setgid: whateverr.  I have tried setting make g+s but with no luck, any

Also, is it just me or is the terminal emulation having some trouble

Even 2.1 is still pre-beta (Hopefully it will become beta this
weekend.) It is quite stable. I have dumped gcc 1.40. I am using it to
compile everything. Chances are some programs you are using is compiled
with gcc 2.1 (kernel is the one.)

Here's a handy shell script to clean up the mess caused by inadverently
getting the screen and keyboard into funny modes (typically by
copying a binary file to the screen). 

Name it something like "cls" and do a "chmod +x cls" before running it.

===============cut here==============
#!/bin/sh
# reset keyboard and screen modes to something reasonable

# keyboard
stty sane
  
# keyboard "application mode" off
echo "\033>"

# US character set
echo "\033(B"

# screen attributes off
echo "\033[0m"

# screen clear
echo "\033[2J"

# cursor home
echo "\033[H"

========= cut here =======

In a worst case scenario, your keyboard might be in raw mode
with echo disabled, so you'd have to invoke the above by typing
in the blind: "cls^J" (ie. use control-j instead of the enter key).

Yes.  If the cpu reads from an address that is not recognised by any
device, the bus floats to a level that the cpu "sees" as all ones.  So,
you can say with certainty that a port exists if it returns something
other than 0xff.

gcc 1.40 is quite stable for me, and probably everybody else. people need to
realize that beta means unproven and possibly buggy.   I wonder what can be

The mount is, ofcourse, incorrect. Reason: Tar archives cannot be mounted
(atleast not until a tar filesystem is written). Anyways, all you have to
do it just

        tar xvf /dev/PS0

You don't need to uncompress the thing. Just rawrite the compressed
file to disk. When untarrint it, use the z option to tar.

        tar xvzf /dev/PS0

Saves you the bother of uncompressing and you can transfer larger
files this way (unless you want to uncompress, untar, compress, tar
and then rawrite).

Reasonable people will have differing opinions on this, I think,
although I expect most will agree with Damiano.  Building X under Linux
is a bigger task than I'm willing to spend my leisure time on.  It
takes many hours to build on a SPARCstation with local disk.  I imagine
it will take on the order of *days* under Linux.  And that's if you've
got enough free disk to hold it all.  And then you've got to figure out
how to use it.  The O'Reilly series takes, what is it now, 8 volumes to
describe X??  Give me a break!  I do this for fun, not masochism!  :-)

While I do acknowledge the huge wealth of applications that exist for
X, MGR is appealing simply because it's small enough for one person to
comprehend and build in an afternoon.  I'm just waiting for the Linux
X port to appear.  When Linux can support X, it will have everything that's
needed for an MGR port, and will be a viable candidate to replace Minix
on my home system.

I have linux installed on my slave drive with DOS on the master and both
linux and DOS are running just fine.

Are there any problems with mounting file systems across two drives?
That's what I am planning to try this weekend and any advance warning
