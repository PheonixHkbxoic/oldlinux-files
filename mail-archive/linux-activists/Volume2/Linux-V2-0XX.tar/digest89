   Summary: gdb and ptrace
   Organization: University of Colorado at Boulder
   Date: Thu, 16 Apr 1992 11:19:55 GMT

   1.  gdb does not work with the new .95c+ kernel.  
           Breakpoints end up in wierd places, etc.
           My guess is that internal structures changed
           enough from .95a to .95c to break things 
           (ie task_info, etc)....

           I don't still have my .95a sources to verify this,
           but if it isn't just me someone should recompile 
           gdb with the new kernel header files.  

           (I have 8M free on my disk, and I don't think 
           it's enough.)

I have the whole beastie compiled on my machine at home.  The problem
I have is that the ptrace() function is not in libc.a.  I wrote a
dummy ptrace() function to link the program.

   3.  GDB 4.5 has been released.  Is anyone building this?>

Yes.  I will after 4.4 works.

Anyone care to volunteer the sources for making a ptrace system
call?

I can't back up my hard disk.  Gnu tar 1.10 can't read files in
multivolume archives that are split across disks, cpio and pax can't
create multivolume archives at all, and diskbackup/diskrestore fails
randomly.

Does anyone have any ideas?

I'm running 0.95c+ on a 2Mbyte system with an MFM harddrive.  I'm
using floppy drive /dev/PS1, which works fine with mounted filesystems
and single-volume tars.  /dev/at0 causes the same problems with tar
(and db/dr modified for the smaller disks).

I installed the MCC interim version of Linux, 0.95c+, tonight.  It was
very well done (the easiest way I know of to get all the shared libraries
going), but when I installed the second compimag disk (with g++ and bash)
and rebooted, sh quit working.  It would not let commands complete output
and gave the error message after any external like sh [8 1]: EINVAL.

I rebooted using the original root and copied the sh from there, and it
worked again.

Any ideas -- running a 386/33 (no cache) with 150M ESDI drive.  Linux 0.95
worked fine.

Hey everyone... I installed 0.95c and compiled the 0.95c+ patches last weekend
and now there's a major problem with the terminal emulation routines. whenever 
I use less or elvis (these are the worst offenders, other things do it too)
data falls thru to the 25th line and then all my data comes out on one
line on the bottom of the screen. stty rows 24 seems to fix less, but elvis
is still screwed up.  this never was a problem under 0.95 (no letter) kernel,
so I've gotta assume that something got messed up along the way from 0.95 to
0.95c+.   Can someone point out what's different here? I'd really like to 
fix this back to the way 0.95 handled it since 0.95 worked! ;-) the systems
kinda useless if I can't read and edit files.

Also having a problem with gcc 2.1. One of the things I'm intrested in is ray
tracing... I used to run DKBtrace under MS-DOS, and then i ran it under AT&T
SVR4 (my last enviornment. yuuuck).  So, i went and got the source again and
tried to compile it under Linux.  *KABOOM!* gcc got very angry and spit this
error message at me:

gcc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 6
make: *** [parse.o] Error 1

Correct me if i'm wrong, but that's not supposed to happen, is it? :-)

I've got X11R5 running under Mach2.6 on my 386/40, and it's quite functional
and used less than 30M.  The major problem here is that the average X client
using libX11.a is at least 400K (stripped) because everything must be
statically linked.  The corresponsing clients under SunOS are around 50-60K.
If the X11R5 can be made to use dynamic libraries then the installed size
should be reasonable.

Subject: If not SCSI, why not floppy?
Date: 21 Apr 92 06:33:29 GMT

As new user, I have dutifully sifted through the 
mass of help files and assorted FAQs.  The beginner's
guide (and other guides) were enormously helpful in 
obtaining a floppy bootable system.

Alas my system is st02 SCSI based.  Any attempts to 
boot a floppy containing the proper SCSI kernal 
causes a kernal panic.  The kernal correctly 
identifies my drive and finds SCSI ID 0 as my one
(now MSDOS) partition.  It then dies.  Without
floppy-booting a SCSI kernal, I am not sure how to
get a SCSI-aware-Fdisk to repartition.  Do I
have to repartition with DOS Fdisk first?  Am I missing 
something in all that documentation?

Not to be defeated by a lack of hard-drive, I 
figured I would use my second floppy to access
uemacs, mtools or anything - just as a test.  
This also failed.  Floppy resets are plentiful.
Given that my system is a clone with A:1.2M and
B:1.44M shouldn't 
             mount /dev/at1 /mnt
or
             mount /dev/PS0 /mnt 
work to mount my B: drive?
Does this have to do with the SCSI card-I doubt it.
The drive light goes on but the mounting
errors-out, leading me to believe that the os knows
where to look (ie /dev/** works) but cannot 
figure out what it is it finds their.

Thanks for any help

Well, couldn't actually tell you what they mean.  But, I would love to know
as I got one when I firsted tried to use my hard drive as root under 0.95c+.
Of course it was a different error and different numbers.  It wasn't causing

If anyone is interested, I still have the EIP, EFLAGS, fs, etc...  and the

That may be bug in gcc 2.1 or the source code is not very portable.
First thing I would do is add -Wall to CFLAGS in Makefile and try to fix
ALL the error/warning messages by including the appropriate header
files.

If parse.c is generated from parse.y, I would use bison 1.16 or 1.15
(I heard something about 1.16 bugs.)

Bison in 2.1shared-A.tar.Z is 1.16 and untested. You may want to
generate parse.c from the other machines to see if they are the same.

Date: 21 Apr 92 07:44:53 GMT


  I asked this before in comp.os.os2.misc but got no answers, so
I'm going to give it another shot.  On OS/2 2.0 GA, IBM has
built-in support for scsi controllers that intercepts INT13.
Does anybody have comments on how this works?  My guess is that
OS/2 uses the virtual-8086 mode to call the controller's BIOS
routines and pass data back to protected mode through some sort
of share memory.  While there probably is a degradation in
performance, a much broader range of devices are now available.
Thoughts?

  BTW, this is crossposted to comp.os.linux because I think support like
this would get a lot more people to use Linux.  We can still have
controller-specific drivers that emphasis on performance, but those that
have exotic controllers can at least get in the door.

BUT NOT THE SCSI FAQ.

The guy running the SCSI project (me) gets lazy, and when rushed just
takes a snapshot of his /vmunix file.  I mount root from a NORMAL
hard disk, major 3 minor 1.  Obviously, if you don't have a minix
filesystem at that location, you will get a kernel panic about
being unable to read root.

See above.  The solution is to change the bytes at offset 0508 and 0509
in the boot image to 0's.  This will rectify the problem.
