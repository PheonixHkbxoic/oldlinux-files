Odd... My make's permissions are as follows:

I've come across something weird and I'm attempting to work out
whether it is a Linux problem in it's handling of /dev/tty, or
whether it's a problem/feature of RZSZ.

I compiled Chuck Forseberg's rzsz ZModem package under Linux using
the sysvr3 entry, and it compiles up just fine under gcc 2.1 with
no modification whatever.  It even works if you use it to transfer
files over the same serial line on which you happen to be logged in.

I've used rzsz in the past under Sys V R3.x, on a Sun system, on
a Vax and on an SGI box without significant problems in the past.
This is, however, the first time I've used this particular release
so maybe it is peculiar to this version, but it has me wondering.
I used to be able to redirect stdin/stdout to a communications port
and conduct ZModem transfers with a remote system over a line on
which I WASN'T logged in (ie. a dialout session).  Simply doing:

  rz </dev/ttyXX >/dev/ttyXX

would do this just fine.

However, under Linux (0.95a) and this particular release it doesn't
work. Inspecting the code in rbsb.c, I find that all transfer I/O
takes place via "/dev/tty", which is explicitly opened and assigned
to "int Tty" and "FILE *Ttystream" respectively.

Is it Linux that doesn't do this correctly?  Do the semantics of
/dev/tty under UNIX mean that it's handles access the console or
are they supposed to be redirected where stdin/stdout point (and
therefore this is a bug in Linux)?

Unfortunately, I haven't done much kernel hacking in the past and
don't have ready access to the appropriate documentation, nor do
I have another UNIX system handy right now to test the theory,
but I suspect that it's a Linux bug.

Could someone please let me know what the "correct" behaviour of
/dev/tty should be when stdin/stdout have been redirected?

Thanks,

I had a similar problem yesterday, but I ignored it.  Several hours

All I had was Scroll-Lock information to go by, but there were lots of
processes whose parent process no longer existed.  I also tried
killing the processes with ``kill -9'' (logged in as root), but to no

With the 95c patches and compiled with gcc 2.1, linux
does not display login prompts on the tty2, tty3, tty4,
though my inittab puts getty's on them.  I think the
problem is with the write statments in agetty.c.  The
following test program is extracted from agetty.c -- it
should display " login: " on the screen, but it doesn't
display anything.
===========test.c=============
#define LOGIN " login: "
main()
{
    (void) write(1, LOGIN, sizeof(LOGIN) - 1);
}

You can restrict the 'D:' partition quite easily.  When using pfdisk to 
partition the drive, set the Linux partition's type ID to Minix.  DOS
will ignore this partition, and if you look at it using FDISK, it will
report 'non-DOS' partition.  Works rather well.

Renice(1) requires an addition to the kernel.  Linux provides nice(2), but
what we really want is BSD's getpriority(2)/setpriority(2) and then renice(1)
is easy and nice(2) can be retired.

The test program I gave does display correctly.  My mistake.
However, it might still be that the problem is with the write()
call.

Here is another difficulty with linux 95c: the TIOCGWINSZ
ioctl no longer tells the screen size.  The following program
returns three 0's:
========================
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>
main()

For size reasons, the distribution shell was changed from BASH to ash. 
ash is intended to be enough to bootstrap the system, not to be used 
as the primary interactive shell, as it does not support command history,
job control, etc. 

To rectify this situation, you must get BASH (Bourne Again SHell) from
one of the usual archive sites.

That is correct.  There are patches which add /dev/kmem and therefor 
ps support to the kernel.  You can get some of the information with an 
unpatched kernel using scroll lock, cntrl-scroll, and the jobs command
under BASH.

I've noticed some comment about renice.  I have added the getpriority
and setpriority calls to the kernel and they seem to work reasonably
well.  I was reluctant to post them because I did notice some odd
behaviour occaisionally....although nothing in the last 2 months.

The only annoying thing about adding set/getpriority was that linux
regards a lower 'NICE' value as lower priority rather than the
other way round.

Still...it worked for me (I think :-))  If you're interested send me
e-mail and I'll consider trying to knock up a patch for it and send it
to Linus for inclusion in the next release.

I'm running into a very weird problem and am wondering if anyone has any
ideas. When I link the tubes code into the new kernel and then use the
floppy drive I get "out of timer requests" and a panic. What I find very
puzzling is the fact that it still happens even if I set all functions and
global variables to static and make no outside references to it. Is there
flag for gcc that needs to be set or something? Or is this just a pointer
problem in the kernel? I can't see how this module can be effecting the
others.

I am also having problems with this.  By the way default 
values are set in kermit and pcomm I am thinking that com1
and com2 are tty64 and tty65 -- but when I try to dial the
machine just sits there and counts down until timeout.  I'm

Subject: documentation for shoelace
From: awozniak@zeus.calpoly.edu (The WOZ)
Date: Sun, 05 Apr 1992 20:55:24 GMT

I want to boot linux off my hard drive.  I understand I need
shoelace to do this (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

So I went off to tsx-11 and grabbed it, uncompressed and untared it,
and attempted to read the documentation.  It appears as if the docs
haven't been updated since the port from minix, and it is mostly a
'by route' type of document (i.e. it says type this, do that, etc...
without really telling WHAT you're doing or why it's necessary).  It
also mentions files which simply do not exist in the 0.95a release
(maybe I need to ftp more stuff?).

Maybe I'm just stupid, but I like to know what the final product is
supposed to look like before I start putting it together.  Can
someone post or email me the details of how shoelace works?

Some more specific questions:
1) does shoelace _need_ to be in the root directory?  Can I remove
    it later?
2) The readme and config files refer to files in /etc/system (mm,
    kernal, fs, and init)  The 0.95a dist does not have a /etc/system  Do I
    need to get these files from somewhere? (I'm guessing the answer
    is no, and this is a minixism, or alternately that the files
    _are_ already there somewhere and I just missed them...)
3) What is the file bootlace used for?  It's not mentioned in the
    readme file.
4) What is the file /usr/src/linux/linux/Image ? (Please tell me I'm
    not going to have to recompile the kernal or something...)
5) When is the file disktab used?
6) How exactly does winiboot work?  What does it do?

Sorry if I seem a little clueless about all this (gotta learn
somehow I guess :)

Thanks in advance.

I can set line /dev/ttys1, which is the device name for com1,
