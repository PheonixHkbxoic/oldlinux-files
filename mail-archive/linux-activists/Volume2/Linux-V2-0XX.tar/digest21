Hello Joel. I have been experiencing the same behavior with kermit.
After much heartache and many corrupt files I tried simply changing
how I was using kermit.

I don't know if this will fix your problems, but this has fixed
*downloads* for me.

Normally when I wanted to download a file or a batch of files I'd run
kermit on the other end and put it in server mode, escape back to the
local Linux system, and do a "get filename". This almost always (after
installing version 0.95) resulted in a corrupt file; that is the sizes
would not even match. Instead, now I just invoke kermit at the remote
system (make sure I set file type binary if needed), type "send
filename", escape back to the linux system, and do a "receive".

Since using this method I've had no trouble at all. Just in case, here
is my .kermrc:

set line /dev/modem
set speed 2400
set modem hayes
set file type binary
set send packet-length 900
set receive packet-length 900
set parity

BTW, those tired of your remote system moving the bottom line to the
middle of the screen in 50 line mode, take a look at where "tset"
(most likely in your .login for Sun and probably for most BSD systems)
and add a "-I" option (tset -I). This will stop it from initializing
the screen. Works for me.  :)

I've got a program that splits files (tars for example) into chunks the size
of a floppy.  For now it has a table of sizes hardcoded into the program.

Given a device name, can I find out:
       i) if it is a floppy disk
      ii) how much the disk can hold

If so, how?

as and ld are ok. But you should dump cc, cc1 and cpp. BTW, as and ld
are not the part of gcc.

I notice that ESC-X shell doesn't work under GNU emacs. Does anyone
know why? Are there plans to correct it? I'd also like to be able to
get at SWI-prolog using ESC-X run-prolog. Anyone know how to arrange
such a thing, or even if it's possible? I imagine Prolog would have to
be hacked at some... 

Thanks for any info,

Joseph

BTW: Re: my previous compaint about compress: thanks all who answered.
Summary: compress leaves a file alone if it would get larger as a
result of compression.

While you mention it.. I snarfed elvis 1.5 from alt.sources yesterday,
and it compiled with gcc2 (2.1) right out of the box with only a couple
of tweaks to the make file.  1.5 is a lot improved from the existing
version (1.4) compiled for Linux, although only some of the screen
update bugs which plagued the previous release are still not solved.
Nevertheless, it's worth upgrading your existing binary.  1.5 is a
lot more vi-like in many respects, so installation requires addition
of a statement or two in /etc/rc and making /usr/preserve.

If anyone is interested, I'll upload the 1.5 binaries somewhere..

Many people have written with suggestion about how to improve kermit's
behavior.  I appreciate the feedback.  But I'm more concerned about
the behavior of Linux itself, which starts killing innocent processes
after a broken one uses up all available memory.
