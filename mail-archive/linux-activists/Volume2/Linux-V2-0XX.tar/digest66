Tcsh has now been uploaded to tsx-11.mit.edu, too.
Tsx-11 was unreachable last night, so I couldn't

It seems that gcc 2.1 can run with 2MB RAM. I think it's the time we
retire gcc 1.40. Lots of problems about kernel and gcc 2.1 are related
to the old gcc 1.40. With gcc 2.1, we can use the shared libs as the
standard. So we can squeeze more stuffs into rootimage. I really miss
bash. I had to copy it from 0.12 rootimage.

What do you guys think?

Oh God. This comes up again :)

No, linux doesn't sound like Linus - it's a short [i] sound, like in
mInIx or mInImal or prInt or ...  The reason isn't that I wanted it to
sound like minix, it's just the natural way to pronounce it (imho) in
Swedish.  Pronouncing it like "line"+"ux" is totally foreign to Swedish:
in that case I'd have written it "lainux".  So there.  Maybe this should
be in the FAQ :)

Ok I checked it more thoroughly.

Following keys gives TOTAL lock up but with Linux stil running:
        Pause
        Scroll Lock (gives a task-info)
        Caps Lock
        Num Lock

The scsi0.95c+ version from headrest is only tested with the supplied

Subject: What about running Linux from DOS ?
Date: 13 Apr 92 16:04:16 GMT

This is BootLinux, a little program that, for those of you
that found ShoeLace too complicated (I'm one of those), will
allow you to boot linux from DOS, and more especially from
a hard disk. To use it, it's preferable to have something
that handles multiple config.sys, like BOOT.SYS for example.

From Linux, you just have to mcopy the file Image after
making the kernel to a dos partition (instead of writing it
to a floppy) ,
or you can also use the distributed bootimage-xxxx.Z
uncompressed.

It works fine with a patched Linux 0.12 and my
AMD 386 / 40MHz, 4M ram, 2 IDE 80M+40M HDs.
I also tried it today with Linux 0.95a and it
seems to work.

The .zip file contains the .COM executable and a
small documentation.

Since I don't know if a lot of people will be interested
in this, I didn't uploaded it. Of course, if there's a
lot of requests, I'll upload it.

Subject: compress doesn't work
Date: Tue, 14 Apr 1992 11:11:42 GMT

I have installed LINUX 0.95a on my harddisk without any problems. In order to
recompile the kernel I got gcc2.1.
Now I have got some trouble. compress "refuses" to uncompress the 2.1misc file.
The file is ok, I checked it on a SUN.
What happens is:
compress starts to work (tar ztvf * shows the contents of the file until it 
dies).
Then compress hangs. The process table indicates, that PC doesn't change.
So I think it's somewhere in the kernel.
If I switch to another VC, I can't do any input. 
So I can wait a loooong time, but nothing happens. If I interrupt the process 
using ^C some messages appear on the screen:

Out of Memory !
Out of Swap Memory!
Memory fault!

But I have 4M RAM and a 6M swapfile !!!!
The same problem occured when I tried to unpack elvis-1.5 (a correct file, too).
My hardware: i386-33, 4M RAM, ST1144A, AMI-BIOS,OAK-VGA.
The LINUX-FS is about 25 M.
There is no special swap device, only a swap file.

I know about at least one other machine with the same problem (using the same
distribution) and another machine where everything is perfect.

It's very frustrating to be unable to do anything, please assist !

Clarification: Everything keep running but it seems as if the
wiring of the keyboard interrupt to the service routine is
being broken after one of these keys are hit.

Are you sure the keyboard is locked up?  On my system, many of those
keys provide a ``hidden feature.''  They convert everything into
control sequences until Linux is rebooted.  So, `a' becomes C-a (which
looks invisible), `c' becomes C-c, etc.  BTW, you can still logout, as
`d' become C-d, and if you have a ``sync'' in your history (bash), you
can use `p' (which becomes C-p) to retrieve it.

I tried last night to get my parallel printer working with linux.  Based

        "mknod /dev/lp0 c 6 0"

followed by a test

        "cat /etc/rc > /dev/lp0"

I got a "ENODEV", so I tried using minor device number 1, which did not
work either.  Is there some addtional setup that I am missing?  I
am running on v0.95a. The printer is a Panasonic KXP-1024 parallel

Hi everybody!

I've got some questions:

        - is there anybody working on a serial driver for multiport cards as
          ast-compatible cards, etc. (There is a freeware-driver for commercial
          *nix-versions called FAS which does a quite good job!) ?

        - under DOS there is a package called FDREAD which makes it possible to
          write 1.44 MB on 5.25"-floppies without problems. I think it should be
          possible to modify the floppy driver that way, it could handle those
          disks. (Perhaps you'd like some extra 240k on your distribution disk)
          Is there a nearer description on the floppy-devices, esp. the minor
          device-numbers ?

        - how soon can we expect a pre^n-release of the new filesystem? (We
          are working with three users on a 386/33 and even though we have
          fast SCSI (Adaptec) the system actually pauses every user if we
          e.g. untar a file of 300k!)

The first chapter (0, that is) should cover basically what the
INFO-SHEET does.

Chapter I should not only cover the physical installation of Linux,
but should also discuss the standard *nix utilites, what they're for,
and where to get them --- i.e., it should be a guide to putting
together a functional system. johnsonm@stolaf.edu says: 
>       With the ABC release, this chapter should only be a minor

Yes. But should definitely include a pointer to a good book
on Unix for regular-guy users, IMHO. Also, I think the filesystem
standard document should be here.

The chapters devoted to software packages should cover 1) Where to get
the package; 2) Best-case installation procedure; 3) Typical
installation problems and fixes; 4) When available, a pointer to a
genuine user's manual (i.e., "Lamport, Leslie. LaTeX: a document
preparation system. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1986"). 

The chapter on GNU software should cover things like appropriate
compiler flags for Linux and so forth. And why they're appropriate.

It's been suggested that "texinfo" be the standard vehicle for this
project. Is this a good idea? I will have to find out about texinfo. 

Comments or (preferably) volunteers?

Between various disasters I've been unable to keep up with linux stuff for a
while. 

Some jerk mail bombed wintermute using a forged sendsys, this meant that I
didn't get any of the mail that was supposed to get there since it had to
be taken off the net. 

Then I lost the use of my account there because of it. But fortunitly WPI
is getting comp.os.linux now, so until WPI's news feed dies again I'm back :)

If any ones mail to me boinged send it again to entropy@goofy.wpi.edu
