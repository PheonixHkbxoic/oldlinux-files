        Hi! Maybe it is a FAQ, but I am new to this group. So, my question is:
I am going to get one 386SX/25MHz PC compatible with 2 Mb RAM, and 80 Mb
hard disk, so I ask: is it possible to run Linux in this enviroment? I just
get it over FTP, but if I can not use it, I will better not try to.
                Thanks. D. Cvetkovic

The no-backspace problem only happened to me in the first VC, and only
when using the floppy as root.  I didn't think much about not having
the BS trouble, until I decided to boot with floppy as root again, and
it showed up.  Anybody else see this?

Hi!

I've been following the development of Linux with a lot of interest, but
unfortunately have not had a lot of free time to actually do anything
with it.  BUT, I do have a couple of questions for the person who is
busy porting X.

#1 - What kind of extra requirement will X add?  (things like RAM, hard
drive space)

#2 - Which release are you working with? R4? R5?

#3 - if R5, will the R5 phone connection stuff be ported?  I'd love to
be able to connect via serial port to run stuff from home.

Thanks for any info you can offer... and keep up the good work!

I'm unable to compile Linux 0.95a, I have installed the new sources
and bootup with the 0.95a binary kernel image, using the old gcc (1.40?),
and I get and error "cc1 got return code 16" when compiling fork.c!
Does this anything to to with the old gcc compiler? Or do I need new library

Subject: After listing processes, all I get is control char's!!
Date: Thu, 2 Apr 1992 18:22:23 GMT

I remember this behavior from 0.12, and apparently it's decided to
stay around for 0.95.  After (inadvertently, actually) pressing Scroll
Lock to get a process listing, everything I typed became a control
char.  So `b' became ^b, `j' became ^j, etc.  Controls stayed as they
were.  In short, there was no way to enter anything but control
char.s into any of the VC's.  Logging out was easy; I just pressed `d'
(and got ^d).  I happened to have a sync in my history, so repeated
pressed of `p' helped out there, and no damage was done. 

Is there a fix for this problem?

Ok, I grabed gcc-as, gcc-ld etc from gccbin to compile the kernel. It went

However, as I checked, there is linux/fs.h in /include. I cann't see why

This gcc 2.1 is pre-beta. I didn't intend to release it to public. I
just got some fixes for the libraries. And I am working on the other
bug. The official gcc 2.1 beta  may be released this weekend. Stay

Subject: gcc problems

I just installed linux on my system yesterday, but have been running
across problems getting gcc working.  I looked over the faq, but it
didn't help.

Anyway, I am trying to install gcc-1.40 (figured I would start with
something stable).  I got it from tsx-11.mit.edu, and undid the two tars
in my /usr directory.  I also got the source for the kernel (the FAQ
said that limits.h was there, but it wasn't in the one that I have).  I
then went in search of limits.h, and found it in an archive called
include.tar.Z in the kernel directory of nic.funet.fi.  Now when I
compile I get general protection faults, and a whole bunch of garbage.

Otherwise, a few more questions.  Linux seems to be missing quite a few
of the process utils (kill, who, etc).  I assume that this is just
because of the betaness.

Otherwise it looks very promissing?  Is there planned support for
ethernet based tcp/ip in the future?  If so I will probably stick with
it (I was planning on moving over to mach).

thanks,
alex

I have Taylor uucp up and running now under Linux 0.95a.  I did the port
under 0.12 but it just kept dying.  I think that the fixes to the sleep
functions in 0.95a is what fixed it.  I havn't tested it very will yet.
I am about to install smail so that I can test sending mail.  I was able
to receive  several batches of news files with no problem, however when
it tried to run rnews the files just disappeared.  Must be because I have
no rnews yet. :-)   I rarely post articles yet because I do not have my
own account.  A friend was nice enough to let me post this on his account.
As soon as I get mail and news up and running on my Linux machine I plan
to send it to tsx-ll and post an article to let everyone know.
(that is if nobody else beats to it :-)

1)  I just tried compiling a ``hello world'' program under 0.95a, with
newgcc.  But as doesn't work.  I tried just typeing as, but I got:

        general protection: 0000

        Segmentation fault

Any ideas?

2)  I was trying to uncompress mtools.n.tar.Z, but uncompress killed
the rest of the machine (I could switch VC's, but none was responsive)
until it ran out of memory.  Even after it ran out of memory it kept
running.  Finally it responded to a ^Z (I'm using bash), but the
machine was still TERRIBLY slow.  Only when I killed the process did I
get control of the machine back.  In the mean time, some misc.
processes had been killed.  One shell was killed, and my kermit
connection was killed.

I have a Dell '386 running at 25MHz, 2M RAM, 25M Linux partition (10M
used) and 5M swap space.

Any ideas??

... And then one day, compress went flaky. Works for everything except

patches for shoelace, and some other odds and ends. I say, "compress
/home/tar/misc.tar", and compress pounds on the disk a litte while,
and then back comes the root: prompt --- and misc.tar is totally
unchanged --- there's not even a .Z on the end of its name. I do a
"tar tf" on it, and tar has no problem with that, it gives me a table
of contents.  So misc.tar hasn't been touched. I tried giving it
another name and compressing it, no joy. What on earth could be going
on here? BTW, I *am* in the right directory, I *do* have write
permission on the file, etc...

Any and all comments are welcome.

Of particular interest is their compatibility and capability to run Un*x

Well,   
        I can only offer my solution, not any reason why.  It seems
that my 4Meg of RAM is insufficient for this mem hog.  So, what
I did was to go down the tree stucture manually, finding all the
sub-Makefiles, and "make"-ing them.  Yes, I know, "UUUuugh!".  But,
it seemed to work.  The only exception was that console.c was too big,
so we hand compiled it.  Don't ask me why, I just work here.  I've
probably got something configured wrong (as if I could configure
something right!), so if anyone out there who actually has a working
.95a system, let me know.
