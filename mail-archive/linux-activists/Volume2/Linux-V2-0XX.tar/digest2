Subject: fdisk -- please try this
Date: 31 Mar 92 15:43:43 GMT

I am now ready to release my fdisk for testing.  The file
/pub/linux/mcc-bin/fdisk-0.9.tar.Z available by anonymous
ftp from hpb.mcc.ac.uk (and mirrored at banjo.concert.net)
contains the source (fdisk.c), a Makefile, an executable
compiled with gcc 1.40, since bugs in 2.1 still appear to
affect this and other programs, a patch for the kernel,
which is necessary for the ioctl call to work, my current
version of hd.c, including part of the patch, and a brief
README file, which I enclose below.

(1)  This fdisk allows the creation of up to 56 logical
     partitions in an extended partition.  Extended partitions
     created by this fdisk appear to work correctly for
     mountable file systems and for swap space, at least
     when the enclosed hd.c is compiled into the kernel.

(2)  I will try to get fuller documentation written as soon
     as possible.

(3)  I would appreciate input from anyone who has two hard
     disks, as well as from anyone who has SCSI disks.
     In my ignorance, I have assumed that the same program
     should work for all.  Does it?

(4)  I have presumed to invent a new partition type code,
     0x82, which my fdisk reports as 'Linux swap', while
     it reports 0x81 as 'Linux/MINIX'.  This is simply because
     I prefer to see my swap partition clearly distinguished
     when I list the partition table.

(5)  Please send any comments or suggestions to LeBlanc@mcc.ac.uk,
     and not to any address which may appear on this notice.
     I am currently getting more than 80 e-mail messages a day,
     so it may take me a little time to get back to you.

I am calling this version of fdisk 0.9, in the hopes of its being
nearly done!

The enclosed patch file, ioctl.patch, should be applied to the kernel
so that fdisk can get the disk geometry.  You can live without it, but
it is easier for most of us not to have to remember, for example, how
many cylinders there are in the disk.  The patched include/linux/hdreg.h
file should be copied to /usr/include/linux if you wish to recompile
fdisk.

The binary version included in this tar file was compiled with gcc 1.40,
since there are apparently bugs in the gcc 2.1 library.

Since there have been many patches to linux/kernel/blk_drv/hd.c, including
the one given here, I am including my current hd.c, which contains
tentative patches suggested by Linus Torvalds, as well as my ioctl.patch.
It is not a final version, as it still cannot deal with logical partitions
produced by utilities from Dr. Dos 5, although I believe fdisk can.

I have been using the enclosed fdisk and hd.c and patches for some
time with no difficulty.  Note that I have only one disk and am running
only DOS 3.3.

Please let me know of any problems you have or changes you would like
to see.  Meanwhile I shall be working on some decent documentation.

     -- Owen
     LeBlanc@mcc.ac.uk

P.S.  In general, you should not use this FDISK program to create
      partitions for other operating systems, only for Linux.

One other thing that occurs to me, how about a screen buffer you could look back
through (aka kermit, or better NCSA's Telnet)  this would be very usefull for
many such problems, several pages of gcc errors, that sort of thing ...  Telnet 
allows you to hit <scroll lock> then move up & down through the screen buffer,
more usefull than the current use of it IMHO (given a working ps ...)  Oh, by 
the way,  if you do hit <scroll lock> how do you figure out which tty is running
which process ??? - a ps like output would make locting errant processess so 
much easier ...  hmmm ... :-)

There were instructions posted on how to boot from disk.  You use
software called "shoelace", which is on tsx-11.  I suggest that you
look at the archives for the instructions.  (There are instructions
that come with shoelace, but they are far more complex than they
should be.  You just copy a few files to /etc, run laceup a couple of
times with different options, and that's it.  Unfortunately I
don't remember the details.)

I get software in two ways: (1) ftp from tsx-11 or other machines onto
a machine at Rutgers.  Then use kermit under Linux to download it
directly to my Linux machine.  (2) run ka9q on my Linux machine and
ftp directly from tsx-11.  Both methods assume that my primary way of
getting software is via a dialup.  If your Linux machine is next to a
PC that's connected to your campus Ethernet, your method might be
faster.

Subject: Re: some silly questions
Date: 1 Apr 92 02:59:30 GMT

karna@pobox.upenn.edu (Animesh Karna) asks about extended partitions.
Linus is supposed to support the extended partitions created by DOS
FDISK. I don't know about DOS 3.3 -- that sounds a little old for
extended partitions, though the structure you're talking about, one
big extended partition with little logical partitions in it, is
exactly what we're looking for.  Certainly the FDISK that runs under
DOS 5 creates the sort of extended partition that Linux wants.  The
problem is that although 0.95a has code for extended partitions, it's
buggy.  Buggy enough that it isn't usable (though just by chance, it
appears to work for the first logical partition in an extended
partition).  To get extended partitions to work, you need to fix one
module in the kernel (hd.c) and if you like to see what the disk looks
like under Linux, fdisk.  A fix to hd.c is present on cs.rutgers.edu
in /pub/linux.  I hope by now it's on tsx-11 as well.  To get it,
retrieve the following three files:

  linus-95a-patch  extended.patch  fdisk-extended.c

linus-95a-patch contains a number of fixes to the kernel.  It should
be done first.  Then do extended.patch.  fdisk-extended.c is a new
version of fdisk that will work with this code.  (Like the original
Linux fdisk, it doesn't let you hack on partitions -- it just
displays them.)  

A new fdisk and hd.c were described in an earlier posting today.  They
may well contain a better way to go.

Linux does not require any special partitioning.  It can use DOS
partitions.  I'd guess that most of us have used the DOS fdisk to
partition our disks.  Linux can deal with non-DOS partitions, and
there are some advantages to using a special partition type code other
than the normal DOS ones.  But Linux doesn't care how the partitions
are labelled.

Linux is a minimal implementation of Unix for 386 and 486 systems
using the PC/AT architecture.  It's based on a kernel that was written
from scratch, with Gnu compilers and utilities.  The kernel and
utilities are basically POSIX-compatible.  There's an FAQ that I
assume someone will post here shortly.  The major U.S. archive area is
tsx-11.mit.edu, though there are other archives (some in Europe).  The
code is generally freely distributable, though there various pieces
have slightly different copyrights.  Most of it is covered by the Gnu
license.  It's probably not ready for naive users, but it's not hard
for a moderately experience Unix programmer to bring up.  If it works
on your machine, it seems to be pretty reliable.  It works on a
variety of machines, though some types have problems.  A lot of basic
Unix software has been ported.  The main lack seems to be X and
TCP/IP.  X is in progress.  There's user level TCP/IP using KA9Q, but
that's useful mostly for dialup lines.  If you're on an Ethernet, you
want a full TCP/IP implementation in the kernel.  I don't know whether
any progress is being made on that or not.

I just downloaded the 2 files for gcc 2.1 from the net and have run into a
few problems getting it all to work. Firstly tar seemed to choke using the
command line   tar xvofvz /usr/gcc2misc.Z    It just sits there for a couple
of minutes and then gives a segmentation fault. I then uncompressed the file
and untared it with the command tar xvf gcc2misc.tar All seemed to go o.k
so I ran the inst2.x shell script which ran with out any errors. Now every time
I go and try to compile a program even something as simple as a print "hello world"
I get the following error message :- "parse error before '(' " where the '(' is 
the open bracket in the main() function call. Everything  I try and compile 
gives a parse errorwhen it hist the first function call.  Any suggestions?

My system configuration is:

386 33mhz 5MB RAM 

Linux .95a with only the patches for ps applied.

Thanks in advance

The patches seem ok, but my printer port gives back 11 on lp0 and 255 on
lp1 and lp2.  It should return 170 (says the code).  I just wanted to as
what's wrong, my printer card (HGC with one printer port) or the patch?

What does port mean here?  Did you have things to configure and compile
or port in the meaning of debugging, patching, editing, getting long
nights and cursing at the author :)  ?

If it was difficult, then a diff package would be fine, otherwise just
comment one or two problems and how to solve them.  I can really need
it.

Concerning grafics: Is there anyone porting MGR?  I recently used
TeX-MGR, a TeX dvi previewer for MGR, on a Sun and it works pretty good.
It uses the printer fonts, so no extra preview fonts are needed.  That
should be reason enough to look at MGR, apart from the fact that it
doesn't need much CPU time or memory.
