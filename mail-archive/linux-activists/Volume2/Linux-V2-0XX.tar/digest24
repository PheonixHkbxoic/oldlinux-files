Linux will coexist with any other operating system(s) which respects 
the "standard" PC partitioning scheme - this includes DOS, OS/2, 
Minix, etc.

That depends on your definition of complete.  Obviously, the OS/2 
distribution includes neither a 'C' compiler nor debugger, compiler 
construction tools like Bison and Flex, etc.   However, a compiler,
assembler, linker, etc and Make are required in a Unix environment
where most software is available in a source distribution only.

For me, a comfortable system is a 32M root partition (with a floating
3-10M free), plus another swap partition. This includes 
everything except the full-blown Emacs.  That means EVERYTHING, 
all of the Gnu file, shell, text, and bin utilities, bison, flex, 
bash, shadow password login and utilities, awk, sed, perl, gcc 2.1 / gas 
and full libraries / include files, elvis, micro emacs, vile, 
ed, full kernel / library source, /vmunix and /vmunix.bak,  cron, RCS, 
compress, tar, kermit.

Full library and kernel source is there, plus the object code from
the last kernel build.

You don't have the same wealth of utilities under OS/2.


I should also mention that before I patched the kernel so it wouldn't
get stuck on hard errors in the hd driver, so I could make a 
file system on the non-error free partition that is now my root,
I was running it on 
my 10M swap partition.  In this configuration, I still had enough
space for all of the "normal" utilities (no choice of three 
editors, perl, online library source, or games) and to do kernel
builds with GCC1.39.

Subject: gcc can't find ___stderr.  Where is it??
Date: 5 Apr 92 03:04:05 GMT

This is probably some inane omission on my part, but while trying
to compile linux/tools/build.c, I get an error message about an
undefined symbol ___stderr referenced from the text segment.

What am I doing wrong?

On a more general note:
I seem to recall this having been discussed once before in
alt.os.linux, but of course the article has expired, and I have no way
to find the information from the archives.  It would be nice if there
were some way to grep the archives while using FTP.  Is this possible?

Subject: adduser (again!)
Date: Sun, 5 Apr 92 06:34:48 GMT


Sorry to be such a nag, but has anybody managed to use adduser correctly.
From looking at the sources and those for login.c (poeigl .12) they do not
agree on the salt to use in encryption and as a result never generate thae
same result for a given password. From login.c salt is the first 2 char. from
the users name. adduser uses a random salt each time it's envoked.
I changed adduser to use uname[0] and uname[1] but no joy.
So what gives?

Aren't you forgetting that Linux (at least according to the info I
have read here, I haven't looked at the sources yet) is written for
the 386 architecture only, while Mach is presumably more
architecture-independent.  On the other hand, I don't know if the
architecture-specific bits of Mach are less or more, line-count-wise,
than those parts of Linux that are 386-specific. The 386 can't show
through on every level of Linux, can it?

For the "hacker" wanting a cheap but powerful system with free UNIX
complete with sources, nowadays the question is probably moot.  There
doesn't seem to be much question that a generic 386 or 486 box gives
the best MIPS/$ ratio.  I certainly don't have any warm and fuzzy
feeling about the 386 or the AT architecture per se, but am still
beginning to accept that maybe I haven't got much choice when I
finally some day buy a home system...  (But certainly, I won't run DOS
on it.)  But who knows what happens in five years?

This is standard behaviour when the 'compressed' file is larger than
the 'uncompressed' file.  You can force compression by 
     compress <misc.tar >misc.tar.Z
and then see how big the two files are.

Um... Wow.  Nice UN*X package.  I've finally got Linux 0.95a up and
running.  I am now going to ask the questions that have truly been
asked about 100 times before.  Since I've never seen the "real"
answer, I'm gonna ask 'em again.

        1) How do I patch the updates to the system?  I certainly aint
           gonna trash my system trying this without some guidance...

        2) Where can I get the PS and DF and HOSTNAME functions so
           that I can find out what's going on, how much space is
           being used, and set my system's name.

        3) Where the heck can I get a UUCP package for this bad boy.
           Right now I've got this way cool UNIX box running, and my
           net mail is being processed by a PC/XT running Waffle!

        4) Same as #3 but a news package (anyone port b/cnews and a 
           nice newsreader???)

        5) How about a nice mail reader (Elm . . . :-)


        Now that I've finished begging and pleading, let me thank all
those who've come before me. It's nice to have this sort of thing

ported, I'd like to give it a go.  Is there, by chance, a list
somewhere of common problems users have found while porting?  And
since I've brought up the porting...

        6) What version of GCC is the one to use?

Subject: partitioning problem
Date: 5 Apr 92 07:28:00 GMT

Hi! everyone,

I finally installed linux on my IDE drive.  The strange thing is that
I created both dos and linux partitions with pfdisk, and activate the
dos partition with pfdisk also (if i activate it with dos's fdisk,
linux won't boot up and i have to re-partition and re-install).  When
I boot up to dos, I can go to the D: prompt!  And it shows nothing in
there.  How do I restrict access to the linux partition from DOS?  I
am really not crazy about going through the installation for the 20th
time, so I don't want to mess up the linux partition any more.

Compress does that if the compressed file turns out to not be significantly
smaller than the original - perhaps your tar file has a lot of binaries in
it? To test this out, use the -f (force) switch in compress, and see if the
.Z shows up.
