Ok, the response seems to make a new pre-release appropriate: I have
uploaded "pre-0.96.tar.Z" to tsx-11 and nic. 

Here is what the pre-release contains:

- truncate/ftruncate/fchmod/fchown system calls

        note that there aren't any library functions for these, so they
        aren't very useful yet...

        [f]truncate needed a change in the logic of the internal
        truncate VFS call - anybody that has any nonstandard filesystem
        probably needs to look it up. 

- io-bitmap syscalls giving root-processes access to selected io ports
  from user space.  There is a "ioperm()" system call that lets the
  process select which ports it wants to enable/disable (all ports
  disabled as default) as well as a (standard sysv?) ioctl interface
  that X uses.

        again, no library stubs, but it allows things like reading and
        setting the cmos clock without using /dev/port, as well as
        control over the VGA registers... 

- mmap for /dev/mem

        more things needed for X...

- the signal-handling fixes needed for gdb

        These aren't yet complete: serial lines still send signals under
        interrupts that can result in problems (ie ptrace doesn't
        correctly get them), but that's pretty unlikely (and will be
        fixed in the final 0.96).  Breakpoints should work etc.. 

- multiple shared libraries

        Up to 6 simultaneous shared libraries/process: the patches were
        originally by pmacdona, but they were heavily changed by me, and
        I think they work in a more natural manner now.  One user-level
        change is that the libraries are now checked for read and
        execute permissions for safety-reasons.

- cleaned up special files.

        read/write/ioctl no longer has special-case code: it is all
        handled with tables to functions.  This will mean that the SCSI
        patches won't patch in quite cleanly into 0.96: you'll need to
        add the code that sets up the functions. 

        Again: device drivers and vfs-filesystem hackers need to look
        into the changes, although they are pretty logical (earlier
        versions just didn't implement all the vfs-routines)

        Note that the vfs-code for select is still not used: select is
        hardcoded for the devices it supports right now. 

- ptrace() has a new interface

        as gdb for versions < 0.95c don't work on the new version, and
        gdb won't work very well at all on 0.95c[+], there was no reason
        not to break ptrace.  Thus 0.96 has a new calling convention for
        ptrace, and the old ptrace library function no longer works. 
        I'm including the new ptrace library function at the end of this
        post. 

- mount() takes 4 arguments, and checks that only the super-user can
  mount/umount things. 

        Happily this shouldn't break any old binaries.

- some general cleanups

I've made the pre-release available only as pure source code: no diffs,
no binary. The reason is that most people that needed this release want
it for the gdb-fixes: and they should have no problem recompiling the
kernel.  Others just have to wait for the real 0.96.

Changes that are NOT in this pre-release, but which I hope to have in
the real 0.96:

        - more include-file cleanups - I'm still working on these

        - the wd8003 driver and hopefully some other parts of biro's
          config.

        - select() using the vfs-tables.

And possibly bugfixes that people find in this pre-release...

I hope you mean /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime was present.  Otherwise
you don't have time zones.

I'm not sure whether the day of the week is worth worrying about.  It
wasn't set properly on my machine either.  I didn't know enough about
DOS to feel safe in ignoring it, so I display it and set it
appropriately.  But I have a suspicion that DOS may not be using it.
Certainly Unix doesn't care.  clock -s will set the Unix date based on
the date and time from the clock.  It will ignore the day of the week,
since that is computed from the date.

The mended version is now in directory pub/linux/tex-etc along with all of the
other tex related stuff at archsci.arch.su.oz.au (129.78.66.1).
This version of dvips does not work with font libraries whereas the statically
linked version in dvips.tar.Z does.

N.B. this is a different directory than previously posted (neatness) and now
includes a README file which gives a very brief description of the various files'
contents.

Linus has detailed some further fixes that were necessary, and I now have
a working gdb 4.5 binary here. It does require those kernel fixes to run.
When the new kernel is posted for download, I'll be uploading the gdb 4.5
binary, cdiffs to the 4.5 distribution and documentation (to tsx-11.mit.edu).

I'm very keen to get something like X up.  At the moment my biggest

Rather than thinking up some obscure and probably bad way to allow

Subject: Result of porting 'f2c' and 'ispell3.00.07'
Date: Wed, 22 Apr 1992 07:07:14 GMT

Hello all,

As my first post to this group (listening for a few months already)
I would like to share my experience on installing 2 packets.

1) f2c, ftp'ed from research.att.com, compiles ok, but if it is run
   with the shared libraries, it crashes on a segmentation violation.
   static libraries work ok. My main problem is that I do not understand
   the full error message.

   Executables from fortran, produced with the f2c/gcc2.1 pair do not
   terminate. Only when I press the ENTER key after the program stops,
   the prompt is returned.

2) ispell3.00.07 compiles great! I've never seen a workstation 
   compiling this software in just under a minute real time!
   Running ispell from the command-line works really very well.
   Running ispell from EMACS, however, takes AGES! May have something
   to do with interprocess communication?

I'll have to look into the problems I mentioned. I just thought: If I
post it, may be somebody can assist me in locating them (I'm lazy).

I'd like to compliment Linus: It is unbelievable how LINUX feels on my 
ETEQ486/33 with 16Mb of memory. During compilations of medium-sized
packages with GCC2.1, my 340Mb IDE drive led only flashes every 30 
seconds for update.... Compilations run at 98+% of the CPU.....

The question have probably already been answered but i could not find it

I have installed shoelace on my computer, changed /etc/config to contain
" boot /vmlinux", made a file /vmlinux with "dd if=/dev/at0 of=/vmlinux"
with my boot floppy in drive A.
After the commands "laceup /dev/hda2 wini" and "laceup -w 2 /dev/hda"
i tryed to reboot and here is what a got:

/dev/fd0 not found - guessing major and minor device numbers.

processor     = -1
ramimagedev   = 512 /dev/fd0
ramsize       = 0

And after that nothing happend. What have i done wrong. Is there something

Hmm. Actually, under bash/sh and other Bourne-like shells

        $ PATH=dir1:dir1:...
        $ export PATH

Under Csh, Tcsh and other C-shells

        % set path=( dir1 dir2 dir3 )

(In which case the environment variable PATH is automatically updated)

or

        % setenv PATH dir1:dir2:dir3

Which does it directly. Preferred method (I believe) is the former (i.e.
"set path=").

Above applies to sh, bash, csh, tcsh. Don't know about ash or others.

Cheers

I just put

        /pub/Linux-source/admutil-1.0.tar.Z

on

        ftp.daimi.aau.dk (130.225.16.27)

It includes source for a better last(1) and setgrp(1) both by Michael Haardt,
plus a SYSV compatible init(8) program with runlevels and all.

This init was written by Miquel van Smoorenburg for Minix, and I ported it to 
Linux with little effort.

There's also a shutdown(8) program as well as passwd(1) and chsh(1).

You should be able to build the binaries with both gcc 1.40 and gcc 2.1.
Follow the instructions in the Makefile and README.

Be warned that the init program is fairly untested, and I don't use it myself.
It's very easy to lock your self out of the machine if you do something wrong
with init and the new inittab format, so be sure you know what you are doing
before you install the new init.

There's also a problem with putpwent(3) in the older versions of libc, and if
you don't fix this or use the newest gcc 2.1 libc (later than 10-Apr-92) then
chsh and passwd will trash the /etc/passwd file and make it hard to log into
the machine afterwards.
