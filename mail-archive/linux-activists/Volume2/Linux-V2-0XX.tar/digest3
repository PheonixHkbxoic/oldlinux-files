look at linux/fs/block_dev.c and char_dev.c.  There are some tables used,
such as the crw_table in char_dev.c, but much of it is common code.  Note
that the tabular "swtable" type of design is only necessary on systems
where you need to add device drivers without kernel source.  Linux
is designed to have kernel source available (Thanks, Linus), so it
can share code where appropriate.

Not without modifying bootsect.S - as drive 0 (A:) is hard coded 
in there.

The Good Thing to do is to use shoelace.  Shoelace is a small 
boot monitor that will allow you boot ANY file off of a Minix 
file system (I boot up off of /vmunix in my root partition,
and for testing can boot /usr/src/linux/Image, /vmunix.bak if
vmunix is corrupted, etc).  

Using WiniBoot, you can boot any partition on the drive too.

What are the resource requirements for linux? That is, how much RAM

file system, so it requires a separate partition? Does it use virtual
memory?

Reply-To: mcollom@ponder.csci.unt.edu (Bryan Collom)
Date: Wed, 1 Apr 1992 18:54:37 GMT


   I am having problems with the lp patches for 0.95a
(from archsci.arch.su.oz.au).  I applied the patches,
changed "outb(LP_B(offset),LP_DUMMY)" to "outb(LP_DUMMY,
LP_B(offset))", rebuilt the kernel, and rebooted with the
new kernel.  I got the message "lp_init:  lp1 exists".
I then issued the command "mknod /dev/lp1 c 6 0".  However,
when I type "cat somefile > /dev/lp1" I get "cat:  write
error: ENODEV".  If I type "echo "hello" > /dev/lp1", the
printer still does not budge and my bash shell is all
messed up (ie. prompt is wrong, commands hang, etc.).  The
special file /dev/lp1 does exist, and I have also tried using
other minor numbers with the same results.  Any idea what
is going on?   BTW, I applied the ps patches at the same time,
and ps seems to work fine.

Thanks,

Technically, a 386 or above, 2M of ram, and a floppy disk.
Realistically, a 386sx or above, 4M of ram, and a hard disk partition
(Bigger is better, but I have full kernel and library source,
almost all "normal" Unix utilitis (including gcc2,
flex and bison (lex and yacc), sed, awk, perl, the mtools,
vi and nroff clones, etc in a 32M partition with a floating
5-10M free).

>

GCC2 is happy in 6M of memory, and swaps minimally with 4M of real memory
and 2M of swap.

>file system, so it requires a separate partition? Does it use virtual

Yes.  However, unlike BSD it will coexist with other operating systems
on the same physical disk, and it is possible to non-destructively
repartition under Messy-Loss.

>memory?

The supported virtual memory operations are : 

1.  Paging to disk.
2.  Shared COW (Copy On Write) pages, 
3.  Shared pages between executables with the same inode.
4.  Shared libraries.
5.  Demand paging of executables.

And a rudimentary mmap(2) is available.

Subject: LINUX INFO SHEET (old)
Date: 1 Apr 92 18:49:09 GMT

Since comp.os.linux is a new group, and many sites are reading it
for the first time, its time to post the FAQs here!  (yes, I know
they were just recently posted in alt.os.linux).  I got these from
tsx-11.mit.edu:

LINUX INFORMATION SHEET
(last updated 13 Jan 1992)

1. WHAT IS LINUX 0.12
    LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

     Version 0.12 is still a beta release, but it already provides much
of the functionality of a System V.3 kernel.  For example, various
users have been able to port programs such as bison/flex without having
to modify code at all.  Another indication of its maturity is that
it is now possible to do LINUX kernel development using LINUX itself 
and freely-available programming tools.

2. LINUX features
  - System call compatible with a subset of System V and POSIX
  - Full multiprogramming (multiple programs can run at once)
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Virtual memory: swapping to disk when out of RAM
  - POSIX job control
  - virtual consoles on EGA/VGA screens
  - pty's
  - some 387-emulation
  - ANSI compliant C compiler (gcc)
  - A complete set of compiler writing tools
    (bison as yacc-replacement, flex as lex replacement)
  - The GNU 'Bourne again' shell (bash)
  - Micro emacs
  - most utilities you need for development
    (cat, cp, kermit, ls, make, etc.)
  - Over 200 library procedures (atoi, fork, malloc, read, stdio, etc.)
  - Currently 4 national keyboards: Finnish/US/German/French
  - Full source code (in C) for the OS is freely distributable
  - Full source code of the tools can be gotten from many anonymous ftp sites
    (Almost the entire suite of GNU programs has been ported to Linux.)
  - Runs in protected mode on 386 and above
  - Support for extended memory up to 16M on 386 and above
  - RS-232 serial line support with terminal emulation, kermit, zmodem, etc.
  - Supports the real time clock


3. HARDWARE REQUIRED
   - A 386 or 486 machine with an AT-bus.  (EISA will probably work, also,
     but you will need an AT-bus hard disk controller.)
     Both DX and SX processors will work.
   - A hard disk implementing the standard AT hard disk interface--
     for example, an IDE drive.  SCSI drives are not supported yet.
   - A high-density disk drive--either 5.25" (1.2MB) or 3.5" (1.44MB).
   - At least 2 megabytes of RAM.  (LINUX will boot in 2 Mb.  To use
     gcc 4 MB is a good idea.)
   - Any video card of the following: Hercules,CGA,EGA,VGA

In addition, LINUX supports
   - Up to two serial lines
   - A real time clock 

4. PARTIAL LIST OF UTILITIES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE FOR LINUX 0.12 
   - The MTOOLS package (reading/writing to DOS filesystems)
   - The complete GNU filetools (ls, cat, cp, mv, ...)
   - The GNU C compiler with GNU assembler, linker, ar, ...
   - bison
   - flex
   - rcs
   - pmake (BSD 4.3 Reno/BSD 4.4  make)
   - kermit
   - Micro emacs
   - less
   - mkfs
   - fsck
   - mount/umount


5. LINUX BINARIES
    The LINUX binaries and sources are available at three
    anonymous FTP sites. These are:

    nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux
    tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/msdos/replace


6. LEGAL STATUS OF LINUX
     Although LINUX is  supplied with the  complete source  code, it is
copyrighted software.  Unlike MINIX, however, it is available for free,
provided  you obey  to the  rules specified  in  the  LINUX  copyright.


7. NEWS ABOUT LINUX
     Since LINUX's  introduction to the public there has been a rapidly
growing mailing list, "linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi". To subscribe to 
this  list,  mail to  "linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi".  If the
traffic in this lists increases  further, there are  plans to swap ( at 
least partially ) over  to comp.os.misc, so  watch out  for  any  LINUX 
articles in  this group.  For the current status of LINUX, do "finger
torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi".


8. FUTURE PLANS
     Work is underway on LINUX version 1.0, which will close some of the
gaps in the present implementation.  Various people are currently working
on:
     - A virtual filesystem layer 
     - STREAMS 
     - init/getty/login
     - Interprocess communication
     - IEEE POSIX P1003.1 / P1003.2 compatibility
     - SCSI support

Plan:

                Free UNIX for the 386

The current version of linux is 0.95a: it was released March 17th, and
is pretty close to what 1.0 will be : it needs some testing, but should
be good enough to use for many things.  0.95a contains mainly bug-fixes
to 0.95.

NOTE! NOTE! NOTE! Plain 0.95 had problems with some harddisks that
worked ok under 0.12, as well as a few bad bugs.  These have been
corrected (hopefully), but make sure you have the "a" version: the bugs
in plain 0.95 can crash your machine rather badly. 

Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused. 

Linux still requires an AT-compatible disk to be useful: there are
patches for a SCSI driver (currently ST-0[1|2]), but it hasn't made it
into the "official" kernel yet.  (The patches are against the 0.12
version, but they should work with little changes on 0.95)

There are now a couple of other sites containing linux, as people have
had difficulties with connecting to nic. The sites are:
        Tupac-Amaru.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE (137.226.112.31):
                directory /pub/msdos/replace
        tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
                directory /pub/linux

(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)

There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'. 
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'. 
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).

For those of you able to read the alt.* newsgroups, there is also a
linux newsgroup available: alt.os.linux, which should hopefully become a
comp.* group when the votings etc are ready.

Mail me for more info:

0.95 contains these new things:

- ptrace (gdb is in beta-testing)
- VFS (at least a minimal stubs-version)
- bug-corrections (notably mm, but other bugs as well)
- better VC's (screen blanking, works on non-[EV]GA etc)
- init/login
- faster floppies

0.95a should correct these bugs in plain 0.95:

- floppy-reset gets called, and the machine may be unable to read
  floppies on certain hardware. 
- Some harddisks get read-errors (resulting in general protection errors
  etc)
- console and tty-drivers have known bugs - sometimes weird output when
  writing heavily to the screen. 
- extended partitions don't work after all.
