Subject: Some Questions Before Taking The Plunge.

Hi everyone.

Recently I have seen the light and decided to come over to Unix from 
MS-DOS.  I have been playing around with 0.95a of Linux to get my feet 
wet and have been quite impressed.

Last night I switched hard drives around, now I have my 40 MB as MS-DOS 
drive C:, and my 80 MB hard drive has been reformatted and it's DOS 
partition removed (as far as MS-DOS is concerned it doesn't exist).

I have been following the messages on this newsgroup, I have read the 
beginners guide, the installation instructions, and the FAQ's, and am now 
ready to take the plunge.

I understand that I can use a hard disk partitioning tool that comes on 
the 'root' disk (the name escapes me at the moment), then I would use 
'mkfs' and then 'mount' the file system to get Linux installed on my 80 
MB hard drive (it's a Seagate ST1102A IDE drive).

Is the above basically correct?  Is there a guide somewhere that explains 
how to add users, etc.?  Has anybody met with success with regard to 
running Waffle under Linux?

One thing concerns me, however...once I install Linux on my 80 MB hard 
drive, MUST I continue to boot up Linux under floppy drive?  Most 
implementations of Unix that I have seen have, upon boot-up, displayed a 
'boot' prompt -- the user could type DOS to enter MS-DOS, or <Enter> (or 
just wait a few seconds) to go into Unix...is there anything like this 
available for Linux?  I really hate the idea of have to use a floppy all 
the time (and yet I still want to be able to jump into MS-DOS on those 
rare occasions).

I am impressed with Linux!  Good work!

Thanks in advance.

Ok, I isolated the problem to a line i kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S.
In the routine that is supposed to set the LED's I uncomment the
second call to kb_wait. I sure as h*** don't what's going on,
but it seems to be some sort of quirk in some keyboards. This is
only a temporary work-around, and even though my CAPS LOCK, PAUSE,
SCROLL LOCK and NUM LOCK now don't cause lock up, the LED's are still
not working. The NUM LOCK LED is on and that's it.

Here is the chunk of code. The line I commented out is marked [NSO].

Excerpt of kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S:

_set_leds:
        movb _kleds,%al
        cmpb old_leds,%al
        je 1f
        movb %al,old_leds
        call kb_wait
        movb $0xed,%al          /* set leds command */
        outb %al,$0x60
/*      call kb_wait */         /* [NSO]: This line teases me... */
        movb _kleds,%al
        outb %al,$0x60
1:      ret

I hope someone with keyboard hardware specific knowldege will look
into this.

Easter,

Ok, here's what I did (for GCC2.1) in cdiff form. This is perhaps overdoing 
it, but it leaves no room for (mis)interpretation :-)

Untar this file in your shellutils directory and apply the patch. Then
apply the little patch in lib/ (They are both called linux.cdiff).
Then run configure and then make.

Subject: rm badness
Date: 19 Apr 92 18:41:23 GMT

OK, this has happened twice in rapid succession, and I think it might
indicate a problem...

I used rm +r early this morning to try to remove my groff source tree.
Didn't work -- rm hung and didn't touch any of the stuff I told it to
delete. I was root, I was the only login, and there were no background
jobs running. And I wan't in the dir I was trying to delete. And the
partition had fsck'd cleanly at the last reboot.I tried to kill the
process (kill, kill -9) to no avail.  Only a reboot would fix things.

So I fsck -a'd the partition after rebooting, and got two "zone marked
used, no file uses it" errors. OK. Tried to rm +r the directory again,
no problem. But then I tried to remove my old linux source tree, and
got the exact same behavior. Including the "zone marked used" error
from fsck. I'm not going to use rm +r anymore until I find out why
this happens.

Does anyone have a notion what might be going on here? Has anyone else
had similar problems? Is my filesystem FUBAR? If so, why won't fsck
tell me so?

Thanks for any advice,

Joseph

Truly inconsequential, but I thought y'all might find this amusing.  I
just tried the .95c+ bootimage out at tsx-11 (I had been using .95a),
and all of a sudden I get the following report from fdisk:

Boy, I think I'll start storing EVERYTHING on /dev/hda9!!  :-) :-) :-)

I guess that, as stated in the installation guide, the extended
partition access is not fully debugged yet.....

Um, if no one else is working on this, maybe I'll take a look at the
code as soon as I get a chance.  I've been trying to think of something
I can do to contribute to the project, maybe this is it?

It's probably  "Unknown device <name>, please specify all parameters".

This means that the device name is not of any of the forms /dev/at*, /dev/ps*,
/dev/PS* or /dev/hd*. Mtools tries to guess disk parameters for those device
names, but it doesn't know how to handle different names. (This is supposed to
change someday.) You have to specify all parameters in the /etc/mtools file,
e.g.

A /dev/foobar 12 80 2 15        # 5.25" HD 1200k
X /dev/barfoo 12 40 2 9         # 5.25" 360k

The problem is not really with the Linux 0.95c+ kernel (or at least,
it shouldn't be!), but rather with the fdisk on the 0.95a root disk,
which is presumably the one you were using.  That fdisk cannot handle
extended partitions properly at all, but apparently the 0.95c+ kernel
now handles them correctly.

The fdisk on the 0.96 root disk will handle extended partitions
correctly....  pfdisk still can't create 'em, though.

Greetings,
thanks to all who have replied to my IDE drive problem. From the responses I
got so far I gather that the drive's poor performance is specific to my drive
and possibly due to inappropriate configuration (translation vs. native mode).
If there is any interest I will post my newly accquired wisdom on IDE drive
setup when the problem is solved (Or should I rather spare you the details?)

By golly that should work.  Why didn't I think of it?

Actually I got around it by making a second root image disk and erasing
mkdir, rmdir, and cat from it to get enough space.  All is working now, and
yes I am happy.

When you use gcc 2.1 to compile any program, be sure to check the
header files. LOTS of functions are in libc.a. You should use libc.a if
posssible. All the functons in libc.a are declared in the header files.
Look into unistd.h, stdlib.h, string.h, regex.h and time.h, etc.
Somebody is working on a complete list. I hope it will come out soon.
I think I can say almost all glibc.a and usual Unix C library functions
are in libc.a. If you find something very usful and not in libc.a,
please send me the source. I can take a look.

BTW, I tried to fix malloc(0) in stdlib.h. It will work with ANSI code.
Take a look at it. Be sure they work right. I strongly suggest to use
-Wall during compilation.

While I can't address using the LPS240AT with either OS/2 or Linux
directly (I run OS/2 on a Fujitsi M2624FA (520MB/12MS SCSI)), I HAVE
used a number of 240ATs in systems I have built for clients and
FRIENDS.  It is probably THE NICEST, FASTEST IDE drive I have ever
come across (and I've used a lot of different drives!).  I can't
think of any reason offhand why you should have any problems using
it with OS/2.  I have no idea about Linux (I'm getting ready to get
386BSD 0.0 myself).  Hope this helps.

I have little enough faith in 1.0 releases, let alone 0.0 releases...

I'll wait for 2.11, at least.
