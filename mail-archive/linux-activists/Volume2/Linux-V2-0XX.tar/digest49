Ok, fork()ing isn't as straight forward to use, but accomplishes roughly
the same thing, altough that approach has more overhead than if you
would have an createthread() call (ex. createthread( stack, funcaddr ); ).
If I'm right (I don't know that much about UNIX) fork makes another copy
of the program, with a seperate data segment, I'm I right? 
With threads you still have access all the program data.

Yeah, that would also be nice! But how about queues? If you
are transfering bigger chunks between programs queues are much
better than pipes! 
(I know shared memory could be used for that, but queues are actually
only a way to handle shared memory).

Ok, also a very nice feature!
That's also a very good way implement API's, in OS/2 the API's implemented
in that way.

The RING messages will definately mess up your login.  We had a similar problem 
with our dialin modems (to a Gandalf network) at Oxford.  We solved this by 
connecting a terminal to the modem & typeing the following :-

AT&F
AT&C1
AT&D3
AT&K1
ATQ1
AT&W
ATZ

now, for the explinations ...

AT&F    = Factory default the modem (ie reset :-)
AT&C1   = V24 signals follow true state (ie DCD comes on when there is a 
          carrier)
AT&D3   = Reset modem when DTR is droped.  (Reset the modem when we are
          disconnected)
AT&K1   = XON/XOFF flow control
ATQ1    = Turn off modem messages (you don't see any responces to commands after
          this, but the commands are executed)
AT&W    = Store the active configuration
ATZ     = use stored configuration

This may vary from hayes implementation to implementation, so check your modem 
manual; what can I say, it works for us !!!  We push the answer button in on the
modem, you could use ATS0=1

Hope this helps,

Tony

Not exactly true.  When you use a swapfile for swap, you are subject to the
vagaraties (and overhead) of whatever filesystem you are using, not to
mention the possible fragmentation.  A partition is almost always more
efficient in terms of swapping -- but isn't so easy to resize (especially
upwards!) if that becomes necessary.

The reason most OS vendors offer that option is because customers demanded
it -- and didn't necessarily mind (or care about) the inefficiency.

However the __ctype that ps manages to find is the one that comes with
linux kernel sources.  

ps needs a lot of include files from the system, to be able to
read kmem and so forth. However, ctype is also in the kernel
include directory, while the intended ctype is in the /usr/include
directory.

I changed
#include <ctype.h>
to 
#include "/usr/include/ctype.h"
and all managed to compile.

It still crashes though.....

Hello Linuxers,

Linux runs, great to have a *real* OS running on my PC :-)

I'm fairly unexperienced with the un*x world, so I wonder if there is good
method to save a software package (Linux binaries/sources or root (!) ) on 
floppies. If not, I plan to write something like what I call a 'mdar' witch 
stands for a Multiple Disk ARchive. So, if this a good idea, and I'm not
reinventing the wheel, I like to hear some suggestions, standards etc. I
can't keep up with the group news, so please email.

I just repartitioned my HD last night.  I used pfdisk to set up the
initial partitions for both DOS and linux.  I used the following
configuration with pfdisk:
        1 6 0 76                # 40Mb
        2 5 77 153              # 40Mb
        3 129 154 230           # 40Mb
        4 129 231 307           # 40Mb

Something was not quite right because DOS formatted the first partition
to 75Mb iso 40Mb.  To solve this, I deleted the 2 DOS partitions with
DOS 'fdisk' and recreated them.  This seemed to work and the C: drive
formatted to the correct size.  I then created a logical drive in the
extended partition and it also formatted correctly.  LINUX happily made
file systems on both /dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4.

In the end, pfdisk works great for linux partitions and DOS fdisk worked
great for the DOS partitions.  One interesting quirk with DOS; I had
to reinstall DOS from my original DOS 5.0 upgrade; even after format/v/s
the C: driver would not boot.  Wierd.
