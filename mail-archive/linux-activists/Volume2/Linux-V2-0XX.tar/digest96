I uncompressed it under SunOS, FTP'd it to a PC floppy and used rawrite to
put it on a disk.  Is there a bug in the 0.95a compress?

I've noticed a few problems upon boot-up recently that have me
confused.  I'm basically a beginner to Un*x (linux), however, up
to this point I've been relatively successful at getting linux
(V. 0.95c+) up and running on my machine.

Once in a while, while booting up, besides the nornal messages..

8 virtual consoles
4 ptty's
....etc....

... I get the message "memory error" followed by a bunch of other
stuff (which I wasn't able to record, sorry), however, the messages
continue to tell me that the partition table is ok and that all 
systems are functioning.  Linux comes up ok, and everything seems to
be fine.  Is there a problem that I should be concerned about?

In addition, more recently, I've noticed that during boot up, instead
of getting the message:

8 virtual consoles
4 ptty's
etc...

I get:

5 virtual consoles
4 ptty's
etc...

What's going on, are these problems related.  I haven't really noticed
if they tend to occur together.

My machine is a 386, 20 MHz, with 8 MEGS of RAM and a Quantum 245 MEG
IDE drive.  I should also point out that the boot disk has been edited
to boot off the hard drive using zipzap (i.e. offsets 508 and 509 have
been changed to boot off hda1).

In addition, I do make use of extended partitions, however, the partition
table shown upon boot up is always accurate.

In an other unrelated/related/? problem, if I try to boot off the hard
drive (i.e DOS v.5) which is hd4, the machine just hangs..... no memory
check or nothing.  What has me confused is that if I use a bootable
DOS disk, there is no problem.  DOS comes up just fine.  My DOS drive
(C:\) seems perfectly happy.  I have designated the DOS partition hda4 to
be active.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks very much in advance.  I apologize if these are FAQ's.

This has already been done.  There's a package called UnixWindows (or UW)
that does this.  From your remote machine, you use a terminal program 
written for UW to dial in.  After you've logged in, you type "UW" and the
server kicks in.  You can have up to 9 (I think) movable windows on the
screen.  Of course, you can only communicate in one at a time, and at
2400bps it's pretty slow, but it works...

Okay, maybe someone can explain this to me.
    I have an ATI VgaWonder graphics card.  I only and able to get
SuperVga modes of 132x40 and 132x25  (is that right.) I wanted to be
able to get 80x50 or
whatever but I couldn't.  Now I installed bootlin and get the startup

  Well, I have a 386sx with an IDE hard drive with two partitions.  One
partition has all my DOS stuff and on the other I want to put linux.  Anyway
using edpart.exe I made both of them primary.  Now here is the problem:  If I
set my DOS partition to bootable and the linux partion to non bootable I can
mkfs the partition fine but when I try to mount it I get a mount error: 2.
        Next I make the DOS partition non bootable and the linux partition
bootable. I can still mkfs it but this time when I try to mount it I get an
error about how mount can't open a locked file.
        Any suggestions, any idea's, I really hope there are. Thanks for
continuing reading and hopefully responding.

I have written to Neville Chandler privately, but as I have received
several queries about this, I believe the result will be of general
interest.

I will -- soon, I hope -- put together another packaged fdisk and
upload it to nic.funet.fi and to tsx-11.mit.edu, as well as sending
bits to a couple of people who requested them.  In the interim, if
anyone wishes for a copy of fdisk, it is available in several forms:

(1)  Obviously it is in the 'interim' version of Linux I put together.
This is a shared library executable.  You do need to get about 1.5
mb of files to be able to extract both fdisk and the shared library.

(2)  An UNLINKED binary, compiled by gcc 2.1, is in the file
misc-linux.tar.Z in the directory /pub/linux/mcc-interim/0.95c+/files.a
at ftp.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.200.7] and at its mirror at banjo.concert.net.
To link it after untarring (assuming you have gcc 2.1 installed),
type 'gcc -o fdisk fdisk.a'.  The misc-linux.tar.Z file is 86835 bytes.

(3)  The source, as well as a Makefile, are in the file misc.tar.Z
in the directory /pub/linux/mcc-interim/0.95c+/sources.  This file
is 134820 bytes.

(4)  The latest version of the README file is README.fdisk, in
/pub/linux/mcc-interim/0.95c+.  It was 9295 bytes when I wrote
this note, but I suspect it was rather larger only minutes later.

I am doing my best to have sources orand patches for absolutely
everything in the 'interim' version, and I am also working on a
complete collection of man pages, as well as a man command which
someone else contributed, but which I am almost, but not quite,
satisfied with.  This will make the fifth and final disk of the
'interim' version, and will include groff as well, since that is
useful together with man.  I hope they all fit on a disk!

All of this should eventually be explained in a note somewhere,
but I haven't written it yet.  Please be patient!  Interim
versions are likely to be a little chaotic in their organisation....
After all, none of this is official.

I suspect it isn't that simple.  Installing the shoelace menu program
in the boot partition overwrites the boot sector.  You cannot replace
it as it was unless you have saved a copy of it, or unless you do a
low-level format of your hard disk!  Norton's Disk Doctor, as I recall,
can write a pretty standard boot sector to your hard disk and save
having to boot from a floppy.

While everyone is trying to get Linux to boot from their

a partition with bootlace, etc., now, I've got rid of Linux
on that partition and reformatted it.  HOWEVER, that
wini boot table still prompts me every time I boot.

Can anyone tell me how to get rid of it?  I don't have the 
knowlegde or skills or programs to actually edit the boot
partition, and I don't have Linux on the machine anymore.
What can I do?  Please reply by email.  thanks.

These days, most hard disks greater than 40 megs will park themselves on

   1) Is there a man written yet?  I was going to write my own and port

   I figured I would ask first.

There is a man written, and there are manual pages being
written/adapted by the faithful members of the linux-man list.  If you
would like to join in this effort (as you seem to have voiced a
willingness to work on this :-) mail linux-man-request@stolaf.edu and
ask to be added.  To mail articles to everyone on the list, mail to
linux-man@stolaf.edu

We have man2, and people are working on man1, man3, man5, and man8 at
least, as well as beginners' guides and users' guides.  There has been
talk about a kernel hackers' guide, but I don't know if anyone has
done work on it yet.

The man is at tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/usr.bin/man-1.0.tar.Z
There are other man programs available.

Man pages are available as tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/man/*

They are not all yet available, but we are working on them.

   If you're getting one block per rotation, that means that the system
   can't keep up with the rotation speed of the disk.  This is not at all
   unusual.  Classically what you do is arrange the files on disk using
   every other block or every third block, or whatever you need in order
   that the system can keep up.  With system v, there's an argument to
   mkfs to specify this interleave.  With the Berkeley Fast File System,
   it's specified to mkfs or tunefs.  Since folks are busy implementing
   an improved file system for Linux, I'm going to hope that this feature
   is included.  It would presumably be easy to put into the current one
   as well, but I haven't looked at the code to see what would be
   involved.

It is also possible to reformat your IDE drive (yes, it can be done)
with a different interleave, in which case your fs doesn't have to
know about the interleave.  If anyone wants more info on this, ask me.
I know that ontrack can do it, and I think that there are a few other
dos programs at wuarchive.wustl.edu that can do it.

Up to 7 windows actually. :-)

I'm not sure if UW is really what he was after, but anyway ...

I'm contemplating porting my program, UW/PC, for DOS (and soon MS-Windows), to
Linux (and hopefully the port will be general enough for other Unixes also).
Don't hold me to it, since I'm still getting the MS-Windows port finished, but
there's a possibility.  I've looked at the code of my DOS version carefully,
and I think I can get away with just replacing the screen, keyboard, and
serial comms libraries with Unix equivalents.  With a couple of other tweaks
to the main code, I should be able to re-compile the bulk of it for Linux
using g++.  (Boy am I glad I designed it to be portable! :-)

For those who don't know, UW/PC is a communications package (ala Kermit,
Pcomm, etc) that understands the UW protocol for managing up to 7 telnet-like
sessions at once.  So, e.g., with a Linux version you could call a remote
system and have effectively more than one login on the remote end (rather than
on the Linux end).  I sometimes refer to it as the poor-man's X/Windows (at
least for remote windowing).  C++ source code is distributed with it.

Unlike other Unix comms packages (e.g. Kermit) that just dump incoming
characters to the tty device and rely on the terminal to do the emulation,
UW/PC for Linux will do its own internal emulation and map it to termcap
requests.  This way, you would get a terminal emulator capable of the VT52,
VT100, VT102, ANSI and ADM31 emulations, and, through the use of the terminal
compiler TERMCC with UW/PC, you can build your own emulations in an
assembly-like language.

If you want to see the DOS version in action (if anyone here still uses
DOS that is :-) , then it's available on Simtel20 as the file:

        PD1:<MSDOS.MODEM>UWPC201.ZIP

A new DOS/MS-Windows version is in the pipeline.  If the Linux port comes
off, then anyone who is familiar with the DOS version should be able to use
it without any trouble.

Cheers,

Rhys.

You don't want to do this - you'll take X (where X is the interleve) 
revolutions to read anything.  Instead, you want to speed up reads 
(switch to DMA), and read an entire track at once.  This will take the
same amount of time as reading one sector.

You can read into a secondary buffer, or increase the buffer cache size  
to be the same size as a track.

The problem with the first method is that you still have to do a copy for 
each transfer to buffercache, which will be a performance hit.  The 
second method will have problems if you are using lots of small files,
as you will use more buffer cache than you would with the current 
system, and stand a better chance of knocking something out of cache
and having to actually read it.  Both have a problem in that track size 
varies for different disks, and you can have a zone recorded device -
but anything that goes through the trouble of being zone 
recorded, or has a really high density probably also has at least a  track
buffer (some of the newer SCSI disks have 256K buffers), and getting the
whole thing in one shot so you don't get hit by rotational latency 
isn't as much of an issue.



which will have some penalty want to buffer at the track level - 
if you want, you can even DMA into it
