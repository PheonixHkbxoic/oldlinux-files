Are there any shar unshar utilities ported yet to linux.

Also thanks to the many many many wonderfull people who mailed me
about linux. I've already installed it on my Gateway 2000 386DX 25 and
haven't any problems yet.

Oh yea Does linux support port numbers too. I was thinking of porting 
Galactic Bloodshed (GB) to linux.

Thanks Again.

I tried find | sort > list, the pipe seems working. Anyone has similar

Call me stupid, but I can't find the hd.h file when trying to patch and build a new kernel with the config95a patches. everything else works, and the patch result shows no failures. I have looked around the tree and found no hd.h.
        Just for the record, I'm using gcc2.0. (I also, I've patched many kernels by now, just so no one asks me if I've ever done this before 8^] ).

Thanks for help.

Date: 3 Apr 92 03:56:33 GMT

can anyone help me please?  i'm REALLY stucked.  here's the story:

i found linux on a local ftp site (sc.tamu.edu, in /pub/free_unix).  the
files in there are images of miniroot, boot-floppy-ide, boot-hd-ide, and
4 bin disks.  i managed to get these files onto floppies and naively
think that i can do the installation.  so i scratched my 125mb dos      
partition and created a 84mb partition for dos, thinking this would leave
enuff room for linux.

then i bootup linux from floppy without any problems.  i ran fdisk, and
it reported /dev/hda4 as 16-bit dos.  i ran pfdisk /dev/hda4.  it told me
i have 306 cyl., 4 heads, 17 sectors.  i did a G 1001 15 17 according to
CMOS, then 2 129 671 999 to set up the minix partition.  then wq, sync
3 times, and reboot.  ran fdisk again, it still only report the dos
partition.  i tried everything i could think of, pfdisk just doesn't
cooperate.  each time i reboot pfdisk tell me the wrong disk geometry.
can anyone help me?  my hard disk is a seagate st1144 130mb ide with
1001 cyl., 15 heads, and 17 sectors. 

i'm getting very frustrated.  is this a bug or am i doing something wrong?

I compiled 0.95a with gcc2.1 today on my 386/33 with 4 MB.with little
difficulty.  Iain had mentioned 
on the net that when using gcc1.4, lines in Makefiles under
linux/kernel and linux/kernel/chr_drv have to be changed:
original:
#GCC_OPT = -fcombine-regs
you should delet the commnet sign # for gcc1.4, otherewise compiling will
stop at fork.c.

I look at the nic.funet.fi sites, and thre are _tons_ of files there, and there
are 'indexes' that show all the files in the directory.

Is there anything similiar to the 00-Index.txt files on Simtel?  that have
name & descrptions of each file?  Also, where do things go?  all in the usr
directory usually?

okay and 2 technical questions:  (1)  I got the gcc 2.1.  but How do I make
        a path for it so I can 'make' from any directory?

        (2)  I keep loggging in as root.  how do I make a login?  

        (3)  how do I copy from floppy to linux's hd?  if I rawrite emacs.Z
                to  a floppy, & then

                cp /dev/PS0 emacs.Z  

                it makes a 2880 block file.  not much good.

        (4)  were these on any FAQ sheets?  I looked around, but didn't find
                any answers.

Hmmm. I have a single 40mb IDE drive and am getting the following:

general protection: 0000
EIP:     000f:00000180
EFLAGS:  00010246
ESP:     0017:03BFFE70

base: 20000000, limit: 04000000

Pid: 677, Process nr:8
10 89 55 ff 8b 45 fc 80 38 2d
Internal compiler error:
Program as got fatal signal 11

I've been getting similar errors like this, and have not been able to
compile even a "hello world."

As an aside: I really think the compiler is fast becoming the biggest
source of problems with Linux. It really is great that people are
donating their talents working on the latest and greatest versions of
gcc (first first 1.40, 2.0 now 2.1), but now there are rumblings on
the horizon about 2.2 and a reliable (what I define as reliable
anyway :-) is still a thing of the future.

I'm not sure what the answer is; perhaps a more comprehensive FAQ for
gcc? Different type of beta-testing program? 

At any rate, I have high hopes for version 2.1 and hope I'll actually
be smart enough to be able to compile a "hello world" one of these
days. :) I don't want to sound ungrateful to the good people porting
gcc,(Thanks for the work!), I would just like to start seeing some of
the common gcc problems posted to the net reduced a bit.

I am having a problem with booting LINUX on my 486.
 
I have a Advanced Loginc Research 486/33 EISA machine with 17 MEG of
RAM on which I am trying to get LINUX "up and running". The boot and
root disks are correct (I have tried them at work on a COMPAQ 386).
 
Whenever I try to boot the system, I get to the part where it asks me if
I want to see the available SVGA modes and the the computer does a COLD
REBOOT. Does the memory POST tests and everything.
 
Any ideas? I thank you in advance for your superior knowlege and
assistance.
 
Thanks, Doug Liston

I added some goodies to this pacth. Now you can configure your kernel

Is this just because nobody's done it, or LINUX' structure would make it too 
difficult, or is it a matter of principle :-) ?  Seriously, if anybody is

Just tried to compile the small programs reboot.c and cad.c

So: where to get reboot()?
