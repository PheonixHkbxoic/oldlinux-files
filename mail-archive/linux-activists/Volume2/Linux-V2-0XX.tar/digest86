I was wondering, would it be possible to implement logical partitions
within a Linux physical partition?  This would help us get around the
4 partition limit in MS-DOS.  The idea would be simmilar to what
MS-DOS does with the Extended Partition can be partitioned into
Logical drives.

(BTW, is anybody implementing SysV style IPC?  Is it gonna be in the
next release? :)

Subject: A new game port, and mtools problems...
Date: 19 Apr 92 23:26:04 GMT

I'm using the mtools.a supplied with DLE.tar.Z in the gcc2.1 distribution,
and I have C defined as /dev/hda1 and D as /dev/hdb1, which is where they
are.  However, when I try mtools <anything> it gives me mtools: command not
found error message.  What am I missing?  Is there some syntax I should be
aware of?

Second, I compiled dungeon (zork) last night; no problems, worked straight out
of the box.  Once I get mtools straightened out or figure out how to get my
serial line to dial out, I'll upload it (the tar.Z file I'll upload has 
all source and a statically linked binary, but you'll have to edit the makefile
and recompile if you want the Great Debugging Tool).

Third, I got /dev/lp as char. device, major 6 minor 1 (LPT1:), which is an
HPIIP.  When I compiled the lp package, all worked OK, but catting stuff to the
printer causes it to be eaten (nothing ever appears).  If someone has a working
printcap that fixes this, it'd be really cool.  When I try to manually invoke
lpd it tells me the lock file exists, even though the one in /etc/printcap
manifestly doesn't.  I'm using the .95c+ kernel.

Help would be appreciated.

I know about linux from reading every note in here since this group started;
it sounds really good, but I'd like to know why I should use it instead
of, say, 386bsd (which I know nothing about).

The problem is that Linux is using the Minix file system, which is
limited to 64MB.  There's work going on to do large file systems.
However now that extended partitions work, it shouldn't be a big
problem.  Just create a big extended partition with a bunch of logical
partitions that are 64M or smaller.  In 95c or later Linux should be
able to handle them fine.  The public-domain partition programs don't
seem to be able to make extended partitions, but fdisk in DOS should
work fine.

The idea is that you make file systems on each of the logical
partitions, and then stick mount commands in /etc/rc.  Once you've
done that, all your disk space will be accessible.  The only serious
problem is that you have to worry about splitting up your usage
evenly across several 64MB pieces.  But that should hold you until
the larger file systems are working.

Subject: gdb still isn't working
Date: 20 Apr 92 02:23:04 GMT

I've been trying to get gdb working.  The problem is more subtle than
I had first thought.  It worked fine up to 0.95b.  However as of 0.95c
and 0.95c+, it stopped working.  My main problem is that breakpoints
don't work.  It's hard to be sure, but it looks like when the program
comes to a breakpoint, typically it gets segmentation fault, though
sometimes I also see the program terminate with signal 5 (breakpoint).
At first I assumed that this was because of changes in the header
files, such as a.out.h, but I've built 0.95c+ with the old a.out.h and
that doesn't fix it.

At this point I can't even tell whether the problem is in gdb or the
kernel.  I'm hoping the folks who did gdb and ptrace in the first
place can look into this, since trying to learn the innards of gdb,
ptrace, and signal handling could take quite some time...  I'd
be happy to test any fixes.

By the way, even in the working kernel, gdb doesn't trap errors.  When
a program blows up, it's supposed to trap to the debugging, so you can
look around.  It doesn't do that.  I think die, in trap.c, needs to
check whether the program is being debugged or not, and do something
different.

Finally, gdb seems to lose control over the program being debugged
if my shell is tcsh.  It works only with bash.

Yes, but this is the fault of stupid makefiles that leave .o's lying
around.  If you're clever and know what you're doing, you should be able to
build it utility by utility, and I doubt that all the object and source for
any one utility is more than a few megs.

The reason X is such a hog is that its designers assumed people have a few
hundred megs of disk lying around to waste.

Makesure you have atleast 2 partitions on the 80M drive, 
and that none of them are >= 64M, as that's the limit for the minix file
system.

You must have a small partition on your first physical hard disk 
with a "miniroot" - ie /vmunix, /etc/config, /etc/disktab, 
and /shoelace if you want to boot Linux off of the hard disk.

Either switch the disks so the 80M is the first physical disk,
and put all your linux stuff there, a small C: partition
for DOS, and use Winiboot to select what you boot, or put a 
mini-linux partition on the 40M drive, and use Winiboot on it.

Another possibility is to get bootlin.zip, which was posted to
comp.os.linux, and use that to boot Linux from the DOS partition - I
just switched over to this today, and I have to say it's great.  There
is the minor problem of it printing garbage instead of the 'Press
enter for SVGA' message, but that's relatively minor compared to how
much easier it makes life.

Otherwise, my root partition, which has everything except /tmp and
/usr, is only about 2 megs.  I would recommend something like 4 megs,
just to make sure you have enough room.  (Mine's actually 15 megs, but
only has 2 megs in it - time to repartition. :)

The old fdisk messes up extended partitions (as did the old kernel), and
shouldn't be used. Not that it does any harm, as the old fdisk only
reads from the disk, but as you saw, it doesn't exactly give good
results.

With 0.95c+, the available partitions are reported at bootup, so the
need for a fdisk is less, but I hope the next release will contain one
that works correctly.

Yes, it's a bug in the kernel.  It was there already in 0.95b and
earlier, but those had a (buggy) workaround that made it work for most
things anyway.  The problem was that not all kernel mode -> user mode
changes checked the error conditions, so things like breakpoints didn't
work too well. 

My personal version handles this correctly (as well as doing some other
things in a cleaner manner), but I'm not quite ready for a new release
yet.  I could make YAAR (yet another alpha-release) or just mail
interested parties the fixes needed - mail me if you're interested, and
depending on the number of messages I get I'll make it a new release. 

Here's a preview of 0.96 (* means already implemented):

* truncate/ftruncate/fchmod/fchown system calls

* io-bitmap allowing user processes controlled access to io-ports (thanks to
  obz - needed for X)

* mmap for /dev/mem - (thanks to obz) allows X etc to use the frame buffers

* the signal-handling fixes needed for gdb

- multiple shared libraries (pmacdona)

- cleaned up special files: partly implemented already

and probably some other minor fixes.

OK - First things first.  I just read a note that said that the Minix system 
wouldn't handle any partitions larger than 64MB.  Is this in reference to the 
Linux partition, or any partitions? (Just curious - I'm running Linux on 30MB 
and DOS under 100MB.)  

Next question - When I get these patches from tsx-11.mit.edu, how do I go about 
incorporatin' them into my current version (I just got 0.95a up Fri and got the 
0.95c.patch from MIT tonight)?

Third and final - Is there a way I can get the .tar.Z files from an FTP site 
and d/l to my DOS machine (since most of my InterNet work is done offa my VAX 
account from my DOS apps), then somehow port them into Linux to uncompress?  I 
DO have a Sun account, but it's on the other side of campus, where I seldom 
ever go... However, I will if I have no other alternative (say, a comm package

Why not implement these in vt100 mode, rather then with direct screen
writes then?  Linux seems to have very fast terminal emulation (at least
on my 386/16 with a very old Paradise EGA), and you might as well take
advantage of those using termcap.  That way people on terminals (and
telnet sessions, when those exist), can use the software too.  It also
doesn't restrict the software to linux, but allows it to work on any
other unix platform (in theory at least).
