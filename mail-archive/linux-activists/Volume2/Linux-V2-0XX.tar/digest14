Subject: Any disk compression utility for linux?
Date: 3 Apr 92 17:00:36 GMT

Howdy netters,

In the DOS world, there is a great disk compression program, STACKER.
It keeps all the files in a compressed form, compressing/decompressing
them on the fly. My 65M harddisk reports 125M after using stacker.
Since my disk i/o is slow, the overall performance of my machine has
improved after using stacker.

I probably can fit linux in another 30M harddisk I have. However, I wish
I could have some more space.  Is there any disk compression program
which can be used with linux?

Thank you.

I am planning on installing linux this weekend.  I'll have to repartition my  
hard drive which I plan to do with regular DOS tools.  My question is which is  
preferable, using a partition for swap space or or a swapfile?  For my setup,  
how many partitions should I define.  Also in using a seperate partition, the  
RELNOTEs remark is not clear if I need to make a file system on a swap  
partition or if the mkswap does it all.  Sorry if these questions are answered  
in docs on the floppy images.  Thanks ...

           I have a 8 Meg system and also am having problems compiling fork.c.
   I would have thought that would have been sufficient....

Read the FAQ -- search for -fcombine-regs.  Basically, 1.40 needs
-fcombine-regs, which is not needed for 2.0.  The sources come ready
to compile with gcc2 -- so you need to edit the makefiles to take out
the # comment before the line containing -fcombine-regs

Hi H.J,

Thanks for the good work on GCC2.1. I have gcc2.1 running on a 2Meg 386,
with 4Meg swap space (it is painfully slow :-(), but it compiles 0.95a
kernel, mtools, ps095 without much trouble, except make tends to give a
segment fault after building one utility. So I just need to compile them
one by one :-().

Anyway, about ps095. I followed somebody's suggestion to use gcc2.1's
ctype.h rather than linux' ctype.h. I compiled successfully. But when I run
it, the same kind of failure as before.

It is possible that 2Meg RAM failed ps (rather than gcc2.1). I would like
to hear some one who succesfully run ps on a 2Meg 386.

I am going to try it on a 8Meg 486 later on, and see how it goes.

Looking forward to seeing your ps patch.

Regards

The problem is as follows: The disckbackup and restore assumes that a read
of x bytes from a pipe always returns x bytes. But this is not true in 0.95a
the read returns successfully even if it did read only y < x (y > 0) bytes. 
(and this is a commonly accepted and proper? behaviour) Therefore diskbackup
and diskrestore are obsolete and need to be fixed before they can be used
reliably(?) on pipes. I do have a fixed version (that I have not used
extensively and hence can be buggy) available. Once again if there is enough
interest I can post/upload it. 

BTW, the fixes needed are very simple. You just have write a readpipe function
which takes same set of parameters like read but insists on reading x bytes by
doing repeated read(.) system call. While you are fixing disksplit package you
might also be interested in changing FLOPPYSIZ so that you fill you disk
as much as possible. 

Good luck.

Ramesh

PS. read from disk files will get x bytes when requested x bytes (of course,
    unless EOF or EIO occurs) - RR.

Not at this time.  You can however "pklite" your executables with a 
shell script like the following :

#!/bin/sh
WHAT=/usr/compressed/$0.Z
if [ -f ${WHAT} ]
        uncompress < ${WHAT} > /tmp/$0
        /tmp/$0
        rm -f /tmp/$0
else
        echo ${WHAT} does not exist.
        exit 1
fi

chmod it to permissions 555.
Make symbolic links to the name of the file it replaces.

Also, if you are a brave and hardy pioneer, and wish to be
involved in the beta testing of gcc2.x, or can wait until
the beta release (if everything goes well, it should be 
within the week), you can use executables compiled with shared libraries.

With shared libraries, executable size drops by a factor of 2-4
for small executables (Extreme example : Hello World, from 25K to 5,
typical example is by a factor of 2 for normal small  utilities, 50K for a ~150K
application like vile).  

Note that this could also be combined with the above shell script.

I have been having some trouble with swappping.  I have a
2 meg machine.  I have a swapfile of 4megs and it still
seems that I run out of memory using make on a 27k source
file.  Is this right?  Secondly, with swapping I run
into trouble using zmodem file transfer.  Although I cannot
remember the exact errors from zmodem, I think its skips some
bytes and gets a bad block error.  Anyone else had that problem?

Concerning swap file, how big should it be?  I am using gcc 1.4
with either make or pmake (pmake is rougly 30k smaller).  I figured
that with 4megs virtual + 2 megs on board would be enough.

   As an aside: I really think the compiler is fast becoming the biggest
   source of problems with Linux. It really is great that people are
   donating their talents working on the latest and greatest versions of
   gcc (first first 1.40, 2.0 now 2.1), but now there are rumblings on
   the horizon about 2.2 and a reliable (what I define as reliable
   anyway :-) is still a thing of the future.

GCC 1.40 should be quite stable.  GCC v2 is still in beta test, and so
of course it is not quite as reliable as we would all like it to be.  I
wouldn't say that the compiler is "fast becoming the biggest source of
problems with Linux."  GCC 1.40 for Linux has been unchanged since
version 0.10 or 0.12.

As I booted my computer off of the bootimage disk and after the question
about the monitor, my system puts up the tty info and then I get several
HD timeouts and then procedes to ask for the rootdisk and finishes booting.
I log into as root and then do a fdisk and it shows my two hard drives and
then I proceded to partition the second drive for Linux.  After rebooting, 
I get the same HD timeout as I did before.  After logging in I do an fdisk
it shows a hdb5 partition with an error message.  I did have success in
installing on to the second drive. I used pboot to use hdb1 for root, and
after when I used that disk to boot, I got the same HD timeout and then
said it was unable to mount root.  I attempted the samething on my 1st hard
drive and got the same exact errors on it.   I saw the post about getting
HD timeouts while compiling and someone was making a patch for bootimage.  
Will this patch fix my problem?  Both of my hard drives are ST-251 40megs

Ok, the problem isn't memory: it's gcc-1.40.  For some strange reason
the older gcc runs out of registers when optimizing some of the files in
the linux source distribution, and dies.  This one isn't the same bug as
the "unknown insn" which was due to my hacks in the earlier 1.40 - this
one seems to be a genuine gcc bug. 

Linux 0.95a is compileable with the older gcc if you just add the flag
"-fcombine-regs" to the command line.  In fact, the only thing you need
to do is to remove a "#" from the makefiles: the line

#GCC_OPT = -fcombine-regs

should be uncommented, and gcc-1.40 will have no problems compiling the
source.  This was documented in some of the release-notes for 0.95, but
I guess I forgot it for 0.95a. 

Why remove the flag in the first place I hear you say? Simply because
gcc-2 doesn't understand -fcombine-regs, as it seems to do the
optimizations even without asking.  There are other things I had to
change in the source to get gcc-2 to compile it, but this is the only
problem that made the old gcc choke. 

With the advent of an official gcc-2.1 (this weekend?), people might
want to change to that one: note however that gcc-2.1 is about twice as
big as 1.40, so it's going to be slower on machines that swap...  People
with just 2M of mem might not want to upgrade (*).  I like the changes
to 2.1: the code quality seems to be a lot better (esp floating point). 

On a slightly related note: the as-binary in newgcc has been reported by
several people to have problems.  Getting as from the original
gcc-distribution by me (gccbin.tar.Z) might be a good idea if you have
problems with the newgcc version.

(*) Even with only 2M of mem, using gcc-2 has it's good points. The
shared libraries should cut down on memory use as well as loading time
and disk-space use. Shared libraries work even with 1.40 if you know how
to build them, but 2.1 does it all automatically...
