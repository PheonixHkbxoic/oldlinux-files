Looking at this, the results would seem to indicate that Mach386 is faster,
contradicting something I myself said earlier.  However, these factors can
be influenced by things like hard disk speed (maybe I have a faster one?),
caching, and such.  But the thing I have never liked about the Byte benchmarks
is that they're too susceptable to being skewed by one factor.  For instance,
the Execl throughput test in the above example throws the overall factor off
by a lot.

Something that I find telling is the Pipe based context switching, where Linux
is nearly 2 1/2 times faster than Mach 386.  I'm willing to bet this is why
Linux feels faster.

Anybody else out ther got a 486/33c running SCO ODT, or one of the SVR4s
(i.e. Dell, Esix), or 386BSD (Jolitz), or BSD/386, or . . . who'd be willing
to contribute numbers from those OS's?

Subject: linux-0.95c known bugs
Date: 8 Apr 92 09:03:21 GMT

Well, only one known bug so far, but a couple of problems. I thought I'd
mention them before anyone else does, and we'll call them "features" :^)

The BUG:

  when using the readdir() system call, linux incorrectly doesn't let go
  of the last buffer used for reading: this results in the buffer being
  marked as used (and if you use readdir() heavily, the counter will
  eventually wrap around, which might result in incorrect marking as
  "not used").  This bug happily isn't easy to find: no current binary
  uses the readdir() system call unless you have gotten your hands on
  the new VFS gcc-2.1 release.  Thanks to Remy Card for finding this
  one. 

  Not too bad a bug though: the fix is very easy.  Add a 'brelse(bh);'
  in the minix_readdir() function, like this:

        if (i) {
                put_fs_long(de->inode,&dirent->d_ino);
                put_fs_byte(0,i+dirent->d_name);
                put_fs_word(i,&dirent->d_reclen);
                return i;

  should really be :

        if (i) {
                put_fs_long(de->inode,&dirent->d_ino);
                put_fs_byte(0,i+dirent->d_name);
                put_fs_word(i,&dirent->d_reclen);
+               brelse (bh);
                return i;

  That is, just add the brelse before the early return.  Sorry for the
  lack of real cdiffs - I'm not at home right now, and the above was
  taken directly from the bug-report mail.

The problems:

  I've had one report that the floppy-driver in versions 0.95x breaks
  when accessing drive nr 2.  It doesn't on my machine, but I'd
  appreciate it if people would test it out, and mail me about any
  problems.  So far, only one report, but that's one too many.

  0.95c doesn't correctly keep track of the 'rss' field in the
  task-structure.  A fix was already posted (and nothing breaks even if
  you don't apply the fix - ps just gives slightly incorrect output)

  And the expected troubles with the change of 'a.out.h' - the old gdb
  doesn't recognize new executables etc.

As soon as I get my own sources cleaned up, I'll send out a new binary
for the 0.95c+ kernel to the ftp-sites.  I've gotten a few mails from
people unable to recompile everything - either because of lack of
diskspace or some other problem.  Tomorrow I'll put the new kernel image
on nic.funet.fi and tsx-11 - it's basically the 0.95c kernel + the above
bugfix + the lp-patches (somewhat edited by me).

Guilty as charged: I made a small gcc.cdiff available for the original
gcc-1.40 release, but I don't think I made it "public" - I just probably
mailed it to some interested parties. 

Btw, that cdiff wasn't big, and I think it was the biggest one to date:
the original gcc-1.40 for linux contained code to fix the broken
-msoft-float (mostly thanks to Bruce Evans), as well as my small hack to
use the 386 string instructions (2.x does it, but 1.40 didn't).  The
newer versions of gcc for linux are probably almost exactly the fsf
distribution: the problems have mostly been the libraries. 

>I have never found source code for update.

This one is mine as well: it's about 10 lines of code, but I never made
that one public either.  That too has been sent out (or rather:
recreated on the fly) to interested parties.  If anybody is interested,
update.c looks something like this:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

void alrm_fn(int sig)
{
        sync();
        signal(SIGALRM,alrm_fn);
        alarm(30);
}

main()
{
        alrm_fn(SIGARLM);
        while (1)
                pause();
}

I won't guarantee that one compiles: I just wrote it in, but it will
give you an idea of the thing. 

>The source code I have for fsck doesn't come close to compiling with
>the current linux include files.

My dog ate it...  Well, close: I had (really!) a new version of fsck.c
that had some minor fixes, as well as compiling with the new
include-files, but I hadn't released it yet - I was still working on the
VFS code.  Then I made a minor mistake in my kernel code, and oops.. 
linux started eating up my filesystem.  I didn't loose anything vital
/except/ the new fsck.c.  The binary was intact, but the sources
weren't.  So the answer is that there simply /isn't/ any fsck code
available which compiles with the new header files unless somebody else
has written one..

I know the filesystem (boy do I know it!), and I've intended to recreate
my sources for a long time, but something has always come up.  I won't
promise I'll do it anytime soon, so if anybody else feels like doing it
(starting from the old sources), it would be nice..

I downloaded the GCC2.1 from tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory:
        /pub/linux/incoming/GCCv2

Then moved gcc1.40 to another partition and installed 2.1, but it seems that
the cc1 came with it dies out on:

main()
{
printf("hello");
}

It says:"parse error before '('"

If I use the cc1 from 1.40 it compiles.  But if I want to use gcc2.1 to link
it, ie - gcc junk.o, ld says "'---' unknown option" and prints a list of options.

Did I miss something?

thanks

Yes, the 64MB limit is still there in the filesystem: it seems the VFS
functions start to get complete soon, but I haven't written any actual
code for any other fs-type.  I'll be adding an "extended-minix" type
soon - it will conform to the native-order-long minix filesystem type,
which allows bigger disks, but still has the 14-character name limit (in
case someone wonders why keep to minix types: it's easy to add, as I can
use most of the old routines anyway, and some misguided persons use
linux and minix side by side :)

As you report you have 0.95c running, it should be safe to use extended
partitions, but the old fdisk probably has problems with them still. At
least I haven't heard any reports of problems with extended partitions
yet, although I haven't heard any success-stories either.

There are other fdisks than the linux or dos ones - pfdisk etc is
reported to work.  I haven't got any personal experience (I should be so
lucky to have the 1024-cylinder problem :).  Anyway, linux 0.95c should
report any partitions it finds at bootup (along with some data on size
and position), and you should check the numbers before using extended
partitions the first time. 

If the bootup-information seems to be ok, try out the extended
partitions (but back up just in case...).

Hello, all!  I spent most of yesterday backing up my hard disk, repartitioning,
restoring my DOS partition, then (finally!) making /dev/hda2 my Linux
partition.  I installed Shoelace so that I could boot either partition.  All
seemed to go OK--the DOS partition is still bootable, and if I select "2" from
the menu, Linux starts to boot.  But what I get on the screen is this:

Load Image
Press <RETURN> to see SVGA-modes available or any other key to continue.

8 virtual consoles
4 pty's
Partition table ok.
Kernel panic:  Cannot mount root
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Argh!  What am I doing wrong?  I used the bootimage-0.95a as my /vmunix file.
I also tried patching it, per instructions in the FAQ, to use /dev/hda2 as
the root.  No dice.

Anybody know what it is I'm doing wrong?  Heellllp.....  I really like Linux
so far.  It's good to have a real operating system (e.g. Unix) running.
If you could respond by e-mail rather than posting I'd appreciate it.

Subject: Read rawritten files from floppy?

        I've read this group for a couple of weeks searching for a solution
to my problem.  I've also checked the FAQ and the installation guide.

        I have successfuly installed linix onto my HD, but I am unable to
move any files from DOS to linix.  I rawrite the files, for example,
emacs-etc.tar to a floppy, but then when I attemp to untar them, only
a couple of directories are created.

        Using tar under dos, I have checked that the file is complete.  I
get a complete listing of all subdir's in the tar file.  Under linix, however,
I get a listing of the first couple subdir's and then the message 'skipping
to next tar' and then it quits.

        Am I doing something wrong.  rawrite correctly wrote the boot and
root images to floppy, but apparently is not writing tar files correctly.

        Help is appreciated.

Quite correct! I changed things around on my drive because of a still
