Hi , can someone help here please. I got hold of the images for boot and
root and tried to run Linux from a 1.44Mb floppy.

The program starts to load ie Loading..........
prompts for a svga setting then bombs out. This happens no matter what
mode I try to set ( pressing space has the same effect) 

System config   386DX 20Mz
                 91Mb Segate/Imperus Hard drive (SCSI)


 Thanks in advance Peter.

The following is a recollection of news items posted when Minix was ported to
the PS/2 back in the dark ages, so take it with a grain of salt.

The main (only?) difference between microchannel machines and ISA bus machines
is the way interrupts happen. The microchannel has level-triggered interrupts
as opposed to edge-triggered interrupts on the ISA bus. This means that
multiple devices may share a single interrupt line. When an interrupt comes
in on a shared line, the devices sharing that line must be polled to find out
what caused the interrupt. That device must be serviced before sending the EOI
out, otherwise you end up getting another interrupt from the same device.
With edge-triggered interrupts, you can only have a single device per interrupt
line so this is never a problem; you can simply send the EOI and then
handle the
device that caused the interrupt. Naturally, different devices must be serviced
in different ways; I seem to recall a SENSE command being sent to the floppy
device in Minix as being sufficient for having it remove the intterupt request.
I don't know what the commands are for other devices. I believe they found a
way to set up Minix such that it would run on either bus, but I don't have
the details. (They = Bruce Evans, Steve Ackerman, and a host of others).
Hope these ramblings help.

        Is there some version of jsh, or some implementation of the
functions fg, bg, %[n] etc... I didn't find them on the version of
bash I am using. Are there several versions of bash?  How do we get 
access to job ctrl?  I know these exist from reading previous 
postings, are they hiding or should I chmod u+rwx mybrain.out?

        Also, is there some list of developers-port|ers so that
it might be easyer to direct financial contributions to this venture? 
I haven't seen any postings with regards to how and to who money
should be donated, and I think it would be interesting to be able 
to direct donations for specific implementations (our unix favourites),
beyond Linux itself.  Such a posting (I feel) would be greately 
appreciated. 
        
        I am very impressed with the work being done!
        (As a newbie-linuxite I would love to contribute...)

That file was created by Norton utility image.exe.  This creates an image
of the FAT and directory structure.  You can erase this file without harm
as it will be created the next time you boot (I suspect that image is in
you're autoexec.bat file).

Several things : 
1. The "normal" distribution kernel does not support SCSI.  
2. The SCSI kernel probably tries to mount root off of the first 
        partition on the first "normal" hard disk, 
        and will panic when root can't be mounted.
3. The scsi kernel ONLY supports seagate and Ultrastor 14F
        hosts adapters.   Adaptec support is finished,
        and will be released RSN.

4. "bombs out"  doesn't mean to much.  What kernel panic is created,
        or does it just stop?

I think there's a general consensus here, that we still need binary
distribution.  However, some *VERY* valid points have been raised.  For
example,  when I go a-looking to re-install Linux (ie: cleaned up my 2nd
HD, made some room :-)   I FTP to tsx-11.  Fine.  

'cd /pub/linux/INSTALL'
'mget *'
'cd /pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin'
'ls'
*** Now.  What the F*** do I _need_ to get a reasonable Linux system up and
running ?   The last time I tried to actually figure it out, (back at 0.12)
I just FTP'ed the whole directory.  Untarred the whole bundle.  Hoped
everything fell into place when I  unTar'ed from "/".   

Although you (Theodore) probably have a biased view, I think even you have
to admit that the binaries directory is a bit ... cluttered?

Thanks for all the help on logging in via modem(I essentially had
to turn every "feature" of the modem off) Worked great!
I connected, and used kermit (via other port) to initiate a session
with my provcomm on my xt, worked great!  I then tried to d/l via
zmodem from the xt, but got nothing but bad crc's(to be expected
going through 2 serial ports and kermit)
anyway, on to the problem...:
  I have this really odd terminal(what terminal isn't odd?) and it will
only go up to 9600 baud(no probem yet) However, it will only do even,
odd, or mark parity(can't force none) therein lies the problem.
I do a getty for it, and the message shows on the screen and login:
i try to type, and no response....
is there a way to do getty 9600 (even,7,1) ttys1?
anyway, it isn't important, just a friend wants to log in and look
around(and I am usually on the modem to attmail :) )
the xt works ok for logins, but it's keyboard is partly broken, and I
often use it for loading new software from messy-dos.

BTW, using Procomm Plus 2.0 with vt100 emulation, and logging in
to an account runing bash, up arrow really works right!  This is the
first(and only) flavor of *nix I have yet logged into that vt100
termcap worked so well(backspace on xt even works right, I didn't have to
reprogram it)  Great Job!!!!

Also, I also agree it is time to end alt.os.linux(too many doubled
messages, and I am charged for them all<i think i am anyway>)

With a little luck and insight from some users, the mystery
surrounding the fatal signal 6 dilemna has been solved.
Evidently the makefile in linux/kernel contains the line
GCC_OPT = -fcombine-regs commented out due to problems (or
possibly a fix) for persons using gcc2.0.  This, however,
makes gcc1.4 choke and die.  Just remove the comment delimiter
and blamo -- it compiles.

The Norton utility 'image', presumably called in your autoexec.bat file,
