I've compiled it yesterday and haven't seen any unusual behaviour
yet. (GCC 1.40, 0.95c+ source, 0.95a and 0.95c+ running, 4 MB RAM,
no swap, 386/25.)

Please don't !  BTW, there are two new gotchas:
   -O6 isn't recognized by GCC 1.40. I've changed it to -O
   the Version [sp?] dependency forces unnecessary recompilation of
     large parts of the source whenever make is run.

I have an Orchid Superboard 486/33 with an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280/D 32 bit  
local bus video card.  Linux 0.12 works fine on it.  I hope to get 0.95c  
installed as soon as I can, and I am sure that will also work.  

However, the fancy S3 accelerator chip functions of the Fahrenheit 1280/D are  
not yet accessible to Linux since no driver has been written yet.  I hope to  
write that driver myself in the future, but I do not have enough info yet about  
that card.  I have ordered an S3 Programming Manual, and I will have it in a  
few days.  I cannot say how long it might take to write the driver though...

For now my video card looks just like any plain VGA card as far as Linux is  
concerned.

However, a local bus disk controller may be a different matter.  Many variables  
are involved, and I have no experience here.

Hi Michael,

I have seen your notice about re-uploading a working version of kermit5A to
tsx-11.mit.edu, and downloaded it (it is dated 4/10/92, I think). However,
it still fails to work with a "segment fault".

I am running Linux 0.95c+ on a 8Meg 486 (with 16Meg swap space). Could you
check it again please?

Dahai

I am trying to ftp from tsx-11 using ftpmail.  the following is a sample mail:

    reply jgifford@attmail.com
    connect tsx-11.mit.edu
    chdir /pub/linux/images
    binary
    uuencode
    get bootimage-0.95c+.Z
    quit

I have done the above three times.  I cat the files, uudecode them, and uncompress
does it's famous OOM and segmentation fault trick.
on a dos box, i used decomp and the computer churned for 30 minutes(xt)
and finally belched out a 9MB!!! file.  I have tried for bc.tar.Z,
pmake, lpd, shoelace, and others, and they all uncompress, but tar can only
read half of the tar(or less), making about 10 hours work worthless. :(

Has anyone else had this prob?

Does anyone know of a solution?

(if someone can send me uuencoded bootimage-0.95c+ uncompressed already,
I would be very grateful. : jgifford@attmail.com)

What I really need is a way to make the ftpmail procedure work properly.

FYI: 386/33 4MB/100MB
     I used my xt to connect at 19200 to 386, and then kermit to connect thru modem
to attmail.  from attmail i dump the uuencoded file to screen and do a screen cature
on the xt.  I then use pcedit(procomm plus editor) to remove all the headers.
then I u/l the uuencoded file @19200 to the 386, uudecode, uncompress, and then
tar doesn't like most of it.  :(
any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jim Gifford
