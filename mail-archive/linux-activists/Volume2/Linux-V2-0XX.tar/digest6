Has anyone else seen a rather irritating problem with the
kernel, that the message 'Mounted disk changed - tssk, tssk'
is sometimes printed soon after mounting a disk?

dd is one of the GNU fileutils.  Binary versions can be found in
linux/bin/fileutils.tar.Z at nic.funet.fi (/pub/OS/Linux/bin) and
at mirror sites (banjo.concert.net, hpb.mcc.ac.uk).

Can it operate on a SCSI disk?

In trying to do the same, I discovered that strtok() in linux was
damaged.

I was able to get most of taylor uucp going by replacing the inline
assembly code with a C version (taken from the net.)

Unfortunately, I was unable to get a reasonable connection going, so
I gave up...

(I sent a note to linus detailing the problem, I don't know if the new
 strtok() got implemented in the 0.95 libraries.  If anyone wants to 
 give taylor-uucp another try, let me know and I'll mail you the
 strtok() I used.)

I have run Linux-0.12 with DTC7287 RLL controller as primary (16 bit
with interrupt) with Linux partitions and IDE ST3144A as secondardy
controller by using a SILICONE VALLEY (sic) ADP-60 LIB/LIBF IDE host
Adapter with re-initialization BIOS.  MS-DOS operates off both disks and
Linux off the first RLL controller.

I partially worked of running Linux off both controllers.  I believe the
ADP-60 operates by polling without using the HD interrupt.  I was on an
extended business trip and didn't finish making a hd-sec.c for the IDE.
I presently am running Linux-0.95a from the IDE as primary with the RLL
off line (only using 125MB with 62MB off-line (-:  )

If you have a XT type controller [8 bits and hence no interrupt, since
the HD interrupt is on the 16 bit extension part], a regular IDE host
adapter will work.

If you have a AT type controller with interrupt, it must be the primary
with the ADP-60 as secondary.

Cindy at tech support at Hard Drive INternational was very helpful when
I bought the IDE.  She looked up to see that the DTC7287 might work with
the ADP-60.  I have not called to see how the ADP-60 works have
dis-assembled the code and have System BIOS book (Second edition) from
Phoenix Technology (publ Addison-Wesley) ISBN 0-201-57760-7

When Linux hd.c stabalizes will definitely use both drives especially if
somebody else writes hd-sec.c :-)

Basically, you defragment the drive, so all of the empty space is at
the end, and then just change the partition table.  And the FAT table.
And some other things....  There was a detailed post on this about a
month and a half ago, I believe.  In princip~ql it's easy.  In
practice, it's difficult.

Of course, you should still backup your HD unless you don't really
mind losing all of your data.

And don't forget to back up your data.

        I finally managed to get Linux reasonably well installed on my
machine, compiled mtools so I can transfer files more easily, and now I want
to try some more serious hacking.  I'm trying to compile the linux 0.95a OS
and its unclear which compiler I should be using.  I curently have both
"newgcc (1.40)" and "2misc/2lib (2.0)".  "newgcc" has some problems compiling
certain files, but my impression is that "2misc/2lib" is "experimental".
Also, does anybody have a file transfer program with the ZMODEM protocol
running under Linux?

It works just fine. This will be the editor that I will suggest
for 'beginners' to the Linux/unix world. I am going to be working

And this is what they will be able to use if they choose.

Date: Thu, 2 Apr 1992 00:13:53 GMT

According to the documentation comments in lp.c/.h machines are expected to
return either 0 or the byte sent during initialization in lp_init if the port
exists.

This has not proved to be the case for at least two machines (the OCT33Mhz and
the Gateway 2000 25Mhz) which returned 170 and 11 respectively. Both machines
reliably returned 255 from nonexistent ports. If this is also the case for
other machines then a test for the returned byte not being 255 may be a more
universally acceptable test for the existence of a port.

To summerize:  mkswap does not actually create the swapfile.  First a
swapfile of suitable size must be created, then mkswap run on it, then
swapon run.  Thanks to those who responded.

I'd like to add that I'm very excited about linux.  It is an ideal
system to experiment with.  Big enough to run large programs like tex an
emacs, but small enough to run on a machine with limited memory and

I strongly suspect that /pub/linux/binaries/compilers/gcc-2.0 at
tsx-11.mit.edu does in fact contain gcc-2.1.  I've grabbed the
2misc.tar.Z yesterday, and the FAQ INSIDE the tar, talks about 2.1,
not 2.0.  I haven't had a chance to unpack everything, so this is as
much as I can speculate.  The FAQ says you need a 387  OR  linux above
0.95 (so I don't think you need a 387).

I too am at a bit of a loss as to where people are getting their
info.  Is there some other group I should be reading?
