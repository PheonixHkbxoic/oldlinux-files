A pty is a "Pseudo TeletYpe".  It lets you give a pipe to something that 
expects to have a "real" tty attached to it, such as most editors,
an xterm, etc.  There are master (/dev/ptyp[n]) and slave ends
(/dev/ttyp[n]) to it.  One program can open a master end, and other programs
can read / write to the slave end to get / send to the master.  

A virtual console is a console... that is virtual - so you can have 
multiple terminal sessions on one physical console.  Basically, it's 
indistringuishable from any other tty device.

Date: 17 Apr 92 07:31:32 GMT

Hi people, I relatively new to this scene and in need of some
assistance.

I have an EISA system, and I have been able to get LINUX to work.
It took me a while... but hey! Anyway, I really want to get away from 
this floppy method of running things, but CAN NOT seem to get the 
thing to recognize my HD.

I got the bootimage 95+, which supposedly has (some) support for the
ADAPTEC 17XX controllers.

I'm not quite sure what the problem is, but I thought that since the
same controller is also in charge of the floppies I might have a
chance
of getting this thing to work.

I end up with the folloing errors when running the bootimage 95+

0 host adapters detected
detected 0 disks , 0 tapes
hard disk I/O error
dev 0301 block 1
kernel panic, unable to boot.

Am I doing somethiong wrong?

Also, the 95+ tar file comes with some c source? Am I to compile this 
first? How can I on a floppy system?

Needless to say I'm confused, and could not find any help that
pertained to my problem in the FAQ pages.

Thanx, and I hope someone out there knows what I need to do to get
this to work.


Thanx,
        MikeE

Thanks to everyone who helped me get my printer set up as /dev/lp1.  Now
for some more questions:

1) Is CBREAK mode broken in the .95c+ release?  I'm trying to write some
   stuff using the curses library, and I explicitly say cbreak();, but
   I still have to press <Enter> after every key I hit.  I also tried
   compiling XBBS version 7.91, which exhibited the same symptoms.

2) How do I set up a swap *file*?  Not a separate partition, but a file.

3) Is Linux set up to be 8-bit clean?  If I set up a BBS, will 8N1 callers
   have a problem?

AdvTHANKSance to all who respond...

        I plan to add a direct to screen library. Basically I envision
creating a terminal type that is a superset of vt100. Nothing as fancy or
system hog like X. Just a characterset based graphix system. So while we are
at it, if anyone has some info somewhere on how to write assembly stuff
under linux, I can start porting some of my dos-mode screen routines.

So that means I have eight virtual consoles available, but I can only

Sorry to reply to myself, but a little expirimentation revealed that
the answer is, "You use the getty program to enable logins on the

        Well, I'm trying to compile it with GCC 1.40 and have found the
following problems so far.

1. no echo - put the following in your /bin directory

        #!/bin/sh

        echo $*

2. va_list redefined in stdio.h vs. stdarg.h - I modified stdio.h to
        include stdarg.h rather then defining va_list itself.

3. No bison - get the binaries out of binaries/compilers on tsx-11.mit.edu
        (I haven't actually gotten this far yet...)

If I get a chance tonight, I'll add more to the list above...

Subject: TEX for Linux at tsx
Date: 17 Apr 92 18:16:53 GMT


In the binaries/usr.bin directory on tsx-11 there is a directory containing
what I assume to be the TEX package.   It contains the following files:


dvips.tar.Z
dvilj2p.tar.Z
ptex.tar.Z
texfile1.tar.Z
texpk300.tar.Z
textfm.tar.Z

It has been a long time since I have done anything with TEX, but I thought
that this would be an ample time (besides, if I can create documents under
Linux my DOS stuff will be almost completely useless!).  The problem is 
that there is no explaination (or none that I saw) as to what these files
are.  Before I download almost 2MB of stuff, I would like to know just
what I do and don't need.  I know that dvips and dvilj2 convert the TEX
output files into the respective printer language and I think that the 
texpk300 and textfm archives contain fonts (yes? no?).  The main program seems 
to lay in ptex and I am not sure, but I think texfile1 contains style sheets.
Could someone more knowlegable about TEX than myself confirm or correct this
and possibly tell me just how much of this is absolutely needed (I have very
limited HD space right now).  Of course, an installation guide would be 
nice, but I can usually hack my way through getting things installed if it
is possible.  If this is covered elsewhere (i.e. in some README I missed)
please direct me to the correct location.

To those who want a graphics library for Linux, you might profit from
a study of the source code to the new 16/256-color graphics library
for DJGPP, the port of GCC to 386-mode DOS. This new library came
out with version 1.06 and from working with betas I know it to be
quite powerful, but not a humungous remote - display system like X.

Subject: Software index for linux
Date: Fri, 17 Apr 92 19:44:21 GMT

One thread that seems to be remaining at a constant level in both
alt.os.linux and here in comp.os.linux is what software is in what
package.  I know that I have had that trouble often (what, for instance
is in tubes.tar.Z??)

There has been some mention of keeping track of these packages in a
"master index" somewhere and I beleive that Marc Corsini has mentioned
trying to do that along with the FAQ.

Now that I have reliable and stable access to news and e-mail, I would
be willing to undertake such a project if enough people felt that it
would be useful.  What I am envisioning is

        1.  An index of what is available, what package it is in,
            and what it does (so far, it seems as though most
            everything is available at banjo.concert.net but the
            descriptions might still help people determine what they
            need).

        2.  A list of software that is currently being ported to linux
            and the status of such a port (if this can be obtained).

        3.  A list of all of the patches that have been made available
            along with the expected source code that each patch expects
            to find.
            
        4.  Any other software-related items of interest.


If something like this were available, I would hope that others, especially
newcomers to linux, would be able to use it.  In addition, it would help
cut down on the duplication of porting efforts and let people who are
working on the same project team up if they desire.

This would require the assistance of the authors of various programs and
ports so that it would remain up to date and, of course, would not be
mandatory that anyone participate.  But, it strikes me that this is the
time to try and get something like this set up -- before the volume of
linux software, familiar and unfamilar, becomes so great that no one
would desire to keep track of it.

As I said, if enough people express an interest in this, I would be more
than willing to undertake it.  Since I am not a software wizard (not even
close) this would be my contribution to the linux community.  So, how
about it?  Let me know.

Subject: make and .95a kernel rebuild
Date: Fri, 17 Apr 92 17:50:49 GMT


Ok, I gather that GNU make won't cut it for the kernel rebuild or
something, but I'm still curious about this bit from the Makefile:

all

Version
        @./makever.sh
        [etc.]

Shouldn't there be some targets for "all"?  And maybe for "Version" as
well?  Do I have a damaged set of kernel sources?  (I got 'em from
tsx-11).

Other comments:

  Is there a limit on the size of the DOS files that mtools will handle?
I've had problems with files around 3 meg or so.

  Shouldn't "compress" and "uncompress" in the distribution root fs be
links?  I admit that this wouldn't save much space, but it would save a
tad.  Also, there's no link to "zcat".

  Is there a reason for the "dummy line" in /etc/passwd?

  In bash, MAIL seems to default to /var/spool/mail/username, rather
than to /usr/spool/mail/username?

Ok, that's all I've come up with in a couple of days of not-very-much-
spare-time-hacking.  I'm sure I'll be back with more comments,
suggestions, etc.  TTFN.

p.s. killer system--I am very impressed.  Major kudos to Linus. :-)

I agree with burley@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu (Craig Burley), but I would
like to clarify and sum up a bit.

Craig writes:

I stand corrected.  In general, however, the problem is that if the functions are
not statically bound to offsets at the call site, dynamic linking either requires
(1) another level of indirection or (2) a fixup at the call site. Solution (1)
can be made more efficient if supported in hardware, and solution
(2) requires impure code.  In general, both these solutions have real performance
drawbacks.  In case (2) pointers to functions have to be handled as well.

Segmentation is related issue.  Segments can provide the extra level of
indirection for dynamic linking, handles for memory management etc, not
to mention other advantages.  The segment sizes are the issue ('286 and '386).
Too few large segments are not good for small blocks or functions, too many
small ones and you can't allocate large arrays.  The good and the bad... life.

The model for Unix has been flat memory, sharing by pages and basically
KISS.  I'm all for experimentation though.  My feeling is the proof is in the
pudding.  Build it.  If it works, everyone will use it.

They may be damaged - mine say:

all:    Version Image

Version:
        @./makever.sh
        ...etc

Uncompress should be a link to compress, but I apparently screwed up
when tarring up the root disk and rewriting it to a freshly formatted
floppy.

I have had problems with adding entries to /etc/passwd, and that dummy
line fixed the problems, apparently.  I don't know if it's really
necessary.
