In case it's significant to my GCC2.1 malaise....

        When I installed, on a newly reformatted drive, 0.95c+ a file called
.badblocks appeared in my root dir. mkfs -c complained about this during
installation. Are these areas available to mess up anything written to them
or does mkfs lock them out?

        I am using a seperate st251-1 MFM drive 7/8 full and bootlace. I 
have 8 megs memory and 4 megs swapfile.

Thanking in advance for any replies.............

the z option on GNU tar will allow this. i've done it many times

included with djgpp, a port of gcc to dos, are two utilities split and
merge. split breaks up a file to whatever size chunks you want nameing
them with a common basename and numbered extensions. merge joins the
split up file back together again quite nicely. dos executables are
available and both compile without modification on linux (they should
compile with pretty much any c compiler on any system). they are
available where djgpp is.

1.      I would like to know if there is a version of the init program which supports  the standard system V inittab format (i.e.  states, labels, run levels, actions ) which exists for linux or which can be ported to linux.
2.      Is it possible to defragment a linux partition
3.       Relating to (1), is there a simple way of permanently  allowing a login through a modem attached to a serial port.

        Any help or pointers to these questions would be greatly appreciated since I am new to the unix world.
        Thanks,

expr is part of the GNU shell-utils. they can be gotten from
prep.ai.mit.edu or many other anonymous sites.

are diffs for the shellutils, binutils, and fileutils available
anywhere ? many of these (includeing expr since i changed to gcc 2.1)
give alot of errors when i try to compile them.

   If what was meant by "unstable" was "dynamic" and "moving", I agree.

   I hope it remains that way. It's great working with an OS that mulitple
   people are working on at all sorts of levels. It's an even greater
   opportunity to learn.

Agreed.  I am learning a lot as I attempt my first device driver.

   But this is NOT FAIR! Anything remotely DOS-associated is definitely NOT
   STABLE in that sense by definition. No memory protection == not relatively
   stable.

Yes, but DESQview _does_ provide memory protection.  OS/2 2.0 provides
even better memory protection.  And someone real pedantic might point
to Linux's lack limit enforcement...

[stuff deleted]

   I previously ran Interactive UNIX for over 2 years. I remember seeing 3
   panic traps in the first attempt to install it on exactly the same hardware!
   I also installed it ans SCO's product on several machines as a part of my
   work and I can honestly say that while the facilities offered by Linux don't
   yet match the SCO/ISC product, that Linux certainly _feels_ and _acts_ more
   stable in most ways.

It certainly does better than the obnoxious NeXTen here at stolaf, and
the vaxen.  It is not yet as hardy as the suns, but it is getting there.

Well, I'm now sorted this one out. What seems to work for me is to have my
mouse on com1 but link /dev/mouse to com2. I think it's time to have words with
the service enginerr who dismembered my machine last week :-). I'll see if I

Use that last method that you mentioned, but exclude the "set" command.
Just type "PATH=.:/bin:/usr/bin:<other paths>"

My 486 running linux seems zippier in all things than the SPARC 1 I
use at school -- except disk access. Moving big files across
partitions is *deathly* slow, as is waiting for way big swappy jobs to
finish. I didn't realize this wasn't normal -- I thought it was just
'cause the ISA bus is so dang-blamed slow... I don't get HD timeouts
or anything. My drive is a 130M Maxtor IDE.

I found out that you get a "PATH" by default when you login.

put the line :

echo PATH=$PATH

at the top of your .profile file to see what your path is currently set to.
You can then append or prepend to it using the $PATH varibale, or you
can completely rewrite it using the method that Robert suggests.

Don't forget to EXPORT PATH before the end of your .profile file!
