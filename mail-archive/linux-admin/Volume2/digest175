Someone mailed me a fix for this. As root, all you have to do is

I found the problem, ksh isn't supported under cron.  The echo only happens
if the script is run incorrectly.  99% of the time they never show up.

Something of interest to note:

Unless they've come out with a newer version of selection (which they very well
may have) selection + X + PS/2-type mouse will not work (device busy, etc.)
                          ^^^^
A serial mouse works fine with selection and X (I love it, couldn't live without

I misspoke -- I started with already changed settings, enabled every
feature (trying to debug a problem that turned out to be unrelated to the
PCI bus), disabled every feature (which breaks a different set of things),
and then finally ended with the default settings.

I've tried two different versions of the ATI Mach-32 based PCI card and

I believe something is happenning -  I'm running 1.1.45 and it is definitely
better than 1.0.8.

I was the one who testified that everything is working.  Last weekend, I 
tried to transfer large file with ftp via my PPP connection (28.8 Modem), and
there I saw the prob.  Transfer was good until the last minute where it 
failed.  However the system did not freeze.  Since updating to 1.1.45, things
are going fine so far.

This problem was occurring with both medium and large file (300K to 1Mb +)
with 1.0.8 kernel.

HI,
Last week i posted the above message.  I think I've found the cause.
I have another PC on the net which I inadvertenly assigned the same IP address 
as my Linux Box.  

A little background on this PC - This is a network management station running 
Cabletron Remote LanView which uses packet driver and FTP's vpctcp.386 driver 
in Windows.  This setup does not complain if there is an existing IP address 
in used therefore things appear to be normal but it is effecting the Linux 
box.  

I've since changed the IP address of this management station and things are 
fine as far as I can see.  I'll follow if there are any other developments.

Without looking too closely at your script, this can mean one of two
things:

a) You are using a command which is outside the path which cron
   supports (usually PATH=/bin:/usr/bin).

b) You are using ksh commands not present in sh.  In that case,
   put "ksh scriptfilename" in your cron file.

Listen, pal.  Personally, you can have whatever screwed-up,
self-serving rationalization for violating other people's
privacy, but it doesn't wash.  I mean, really.  Have you ever
been a burglary victim?  Do you think it makes the victim feel
less violated because the burglar entered through an unlocked

The question in the Subject is the generic "Has anyone gotten ftape to
work?" and doesn't refer to Slackware.  You might claim that's what you
were talking about, but that's not how others and I have interpreted
your question.  If I could even call it a question.

Please, Tim.  I know you're frustrated.  I've tried to help you.  But
rhetorical questions posted to the Net like "Has anyone gotten ftape to
work?" are not encouraging.

Are you using tar with compression?  I've found that I have better luck
if I use the --block-compress option of tar, to provide a bigger buffer
space between where tar is and where gzip is.  That might solve your
overrun problems.  This issue is covered in the ftape HOWTO.

> You're obviously a kernel hacker.

Sure, that's why I've been helping you and everyone else the best I can,
especially with Conner drives it the accompanying buggy formatting
software.

No, I didn't get it from Slackware.  I don't get anything from
Slackware.  It's a great distribution, but it was two years too late for
me.  As Bas has come out with new versions, I've grabbed them myself so
I can help test them.

tar --block-compress -czf /dev/ftape files ... 

That's what I use.  Works like a charm during the day while I'm gone.

That's entirely possible.  Bugs happen.  Are you accusing us?

No.  I've found that after posting the two patches to sunsite next to
the ftape sources in kernel/tapes, the number of daily articles here
about ftape (which mostly concerned getting it to work with the newer
kernels) has dropped.

And in another post you said that this is unreasonable, having to
upgrade "everything" just to get a single package to work.  I'm
countering that this advice is too strong; that you can get ftape
working with less recent kernels.  And if you want to run it with a
1.1.4x kernel, then just drop the second argument "ftape" from
request_dma().  I suppose I could have mentioned that last bit in
ftape-irq-dma.patch.

> It's not much help telling people

> if it doesn't work for them.

And it's even less help for you to be bashing Bas.  He's put in a lot of
hard work, and although I'm still wondering where he's disappeared to,
it's because of this work that I can backup my Linux system with a $150
floppy tape drive.  It's less help for you to be telling people that
they have to upgrade "everything" to get ftape to work, advice that's so
strong you'll scare people away.  It's no help for you to ask "Has
anyone gotten ftape to work?" implying that it's hopeless.  It isn't.

I think that you need to have the PB write them out to an MSDOS formatted
floppy.  You can then mount the floppy directly on a Linux system compiled with
the MSDOS files system support (or use the mtools on a system without it).
There is currently no support for MAC format floppies under Linux.

Is there even a project ongoing to support it?  I thought that at least at some
level Apple used some variable speed drives and varied the speed of the drive
depending on which track was being written to.  This allowed them to write
more sectors onto some tracks than others resulting in more storage.  The
floppy drives found in most "IBM-compatible" PCs are fixed speed drives
making it near impossible to read Apple formatted floppies (never mind
write them).

If your PB is using a fixed speed floppy drive, then it should be possible
to read them under Linux.  Whether you can or not will depend on the system
software (floppy disk driver, and whether or not it can recognize and support
the drive).
