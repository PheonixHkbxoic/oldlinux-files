That's what the commercial UNIX vendors would like you to believe.  Note 
that this particular security hole had nothing to do with Linux itself, 
it was a smail bug.  Isn't smail used on systems other than Linux?

I believe Linux is as secure as it is because people are letting everyone 
know when there is a problem.  Fixes or work-arounds appear almost 
immediately.  If you believe your site has idiots who will try to exploit 
these holes, I would suggest watching the newsgroups closely.  Either 
that or kick the idiots off.  Anyway, when's the last time a network hole 
showed up?

My $.02,

You won't need to modify your Workspace menu.

Yep.

BTW: You can delete your old X11 bin files, rm -R /usr/X11/bin but ...
     I notice a few symbolic links in this directory.  So, you should maybe
     consider making these symbolic links in the new /usr/X11R6/bin.  Most

You will need to recompile libXpm and make new shared libs. Get the

NEEDS_SHRLIB_libX11_6 (somewhere in src/jump, I think), and recompile

In some cases, the old chip must be yanked and the new chip inserted in
its place.  So it updates a 486-33 computer system to a 486-66, but the
chip itself is replaced.

I know there are (for some systems) ways to upgrade w/o yanking the old
chip.  Does anyone know more about these, or was I misinformed?

Installed Linux 1.1.52 & Ftape 1.13b. Can't reproduce the
problem. Only I/O-error I got was by forgetting that the
non-rewinding driver was being used and hitting end-of-tape!
So the old bug seems to be gone. Backed up 129 Mb in 36 minutes.
Just as well, because immediately thereafter I did the classical
*U*X goof 'rm -rf ftape *' in my home directory!!!

However, I had another curious problem: Somehow the tape got
into a state where it stayed busy after commands so I had to
eject and reinsert the tape between each command. Only got back
to normal after cycling power.

Subject: Not logging out from xterms
Date: 10 Oct 1994 13:15:08 GMT


I have a slight problem. When people log out from windows in Xfree86
they only get 'half' logged out. The shell is killed and the user is no
longer shown on the who-information. But he/she is still listed in the
finger-info, and gets quite some idle time after a while. :)
The tty still seems free for other users though, since eventually someone
logs in on it, even if it is occupied according to the finger-info.
The shell is killed, and no processes runs on that particular tty, but yet
finger believe someone is logged in.
Anyone know what is causing this? is it finger that is messing, or is it
X?

Thanks in advance

I can't get any of openlook or fvwm to work. I'm inclined to think this is
probably X11R6 incompatibilities with these packages rather than bugs. So
until they appear fixed I shall stay with 2.1.1.

Interesting, I have that same board and didn't need to change any of
the default settings.  I wonder how old you board is.  Mine was made
about 3 months ago.  Could you be having interferance with one of
your cards?  From what I've gathered it's rather sensitive to some
video cards out there.  I have a ISA bus ViewLogic 928 Movie, from my
previous sytem, that was causing bootup problems till I replaced it
with a different card.  Right now I only have two cards in the system,
a real old ATI VGA Wonder 16 and a generic 2 port 16550 card.  I'm soon
looking to get the new ATI PCI video card for it.  I Want X-Windows
back up and running.

Depends on what window manager you are using, I think, and probably what
widget set also.

If using olwm (or olvwm) you can set a resource called
"OpenWindows.MultiClickTimeout". I currently have it set to 4 (milliseconds
I think). All xview programs _should_ use this value. YMMV (Your Mileage May
Vary)

looking for a Video card that has really good Linux drivers.  Things to take
note when giving advice:  We are not looking for a 64 bit Video card, so
please don't recomend them, unless they are the best card hands down.

Please e-mail responces back to me.  I  don't frequent this group.

Help.  I follow all of the normal steps, but when I "make proper", it 
exits on an error.  I am stuck at this point.  No problems in previous 
patches.  Help!

     Dialup logins seem to be a real headache under Linux.  After a lot
of experimenting I would have to suggest that you use getty_ps, not
agetty.  As a further tip, some modems seem to barf on the configuration
files (either /etc/conf.uugetty or /etc/default/uugetty, depending on
how you compiled getty_ps).  I've had some success with commenting out
the INIT line in the file and letting the default compiled in work.
