Hi folks
      I am trying to program in X-Windows under linux using Phigs, and am 
successful in to compiling it and getting an executable file, but when I 
execute it I got a run time error saying that my PEX is incompatable. I am 
helpless if any body have done programing in phigs please share your 
experience so I can continue, It is a graphics class project.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^** Is this really true?

If so it is in contradiction with the info from "man 5 crontab"
which claims that you can set the shell in the crontab file with
"SHELL=/bin/<shell>". Quote from "man 5 crontab":

       Several  environment variables are set up automatically by
       the crond(8) daemon  from  the  /etc/passwd  line  of  the
       crontab's  owner:  USER, HOME, and SHELL.  HOME and SHELL
       may be overridden by settings in the  crontab;   USER  may
       not.

       (Note:  for  UUCP,  always  set SHELL=/bin/sh, or crond(8)
       will  cheerfully try  to  execute  your  commands   using
       /usr/lib/uucp/uucico.)

The "default" crontab file with SlackWare has "SHELL=/bin/sh".
Maybe the trouble lies here ... ?

Apart from something like the "attic" cache suggested by Frank Brokken,
I don't think there is any such thing (though I have a vague memory of
once seeing something posted .. does anyone know?). You're presumably
thinking along the lines of the DOS "undelete" command which, I think,
was first put out with DR-DOS.

As a general rule, such a facility is unlikly to work reliably with UNIX 
systems because they are constantly doing systems stuff in the background,
so you never know quite where you are, unlike DOS. 

There is one possible desperate resource which I mention without
recommending it. Since Linux normally does a disk "sync" evry 30 seconds,
if you hit the Reset button IMMEDIATELY after doing "rm -r *", you
have a chance of rebooting into a file system where the deletes have not
yet been written to disk. Only problem is, other essential stuff may
also not have been written to disk, but if you're lucky you won't
have any problems that "fsck" can't untangle. If you're unlucky ...
(still if you were in directory "/" when you did "rm -r *", as can
all too easily happen if you've been happily flipping between
virtual consoles, it may be your only chance. Worked for me once ... ).

Ok, that sounds right.  Let me make a correction.  The following must
be the case.  The cron with linux uses the shell the user is setup.
So it cannot handle more than one type of shell script per user.

Nope.  Just plain false.  No measurable "busy waiting" is used for IDE drives
under linux.  Read/Write operations are interrupt driven, not polled.
Note that the effect of this is unnoticeable under most single-user situations,
since writes are deferred by the buffer-cache, and reads usually imply that
the user is sitting there waiting for the data anyhow.  With lots of processes
running and performing I/O, the general (unproven) opinion is that SCSI really
ought to perform better.  I agree.

Subject: talkd does NOT work; where to find patches?
Date: Wed, 12 Oct 1994 16:19:24 GMT
Reply-To: ockers@umr.edu

Hello y'all,

I am running slackware 2.0 (kernel 1.0.9) on a 486 with pretty much
generic hardware.  I have had no major problems with any of  the net-
working software EXCEPT for the talk daemon.

I can talk to other users when they are logged into my host, but I
cannot make a talk connection to any other host on the local network.
I have tried this with Sun workstations running  "System V Release 4.0"
of the Sun OS, HP-PA workstations running HP-UX 9.0.5, and PC's running
winsock talk software.

The linux box will receive talk connections from other hosts but always
fails when trying to establish the connection.  Also it always fails when
attempting to initiate a talk connection.  Essentially I can listen but
I can't talk unless the "talkee" is on localhost.

I am 100% confident that the problem is with the Linux talk daemon,
because all of the others can make talk connections amongst themselves
which work quite well.  The only one that will not communicate is linux.

Where can I find the patches to make this work?  Somebody told me that
there were some patches released shortly after Slackware became available.
I have been unable to find them, and would appreciate a pointer in the
right direction.  Thanks!

You could do that, but why not take the easier and better route and
use tcpdump?  tcpdump3.0 is available on sunsite.unc.edu in
pub/Linux/system/Network/management, and probably in a whole lot of
other places as well.

tcpdump is a good all around ethernet monitor.  I prefer 'snoop' on
Solaris, but I doubt we'll be seeing a linux port of it any time real
soon.

And for all you unethical users out there, hacking telnet/rlogin/ftp
password sniffing into tcpdump is pretty trivial.

For some REALLY strange reason, whenever a new user is created on my 
system and the first piece of mail they ever get is spooled to their 
account, their mail file get created with group ownership of 'users' 
instead of 'mail'.  If i chgrp this, it won't switch back.  (obviously I 
am doing this...we don't need the whole world reading everyone else's 
mail).  This DIDN'T use to happen.  I cannot think of any configuration 
items for smail that I have changed besides editing the config file to 
take out the extra spaces at the end of lines that were messing up the 
headers (this is a well known documented bug in the dist).  So I need 
some ideas as to what is causing this strange thing to happen.

What's more, if I remember correctly, the original reason for this
agreement was that Intel wanted to sell to the government, who won't
buy anything unless there's a second source for it.  (an entirely

I've been trying to run ttysnoop-0.11. I got it from sunsite:
        /pub/Linux/utils/terminal/ttysnoop-0.11.tar.gz  

It seemed to compile OK but my problem is with this line from the README:
 "tell your getty/telnetd to execute /sbin/ttysnoops as the login program
(instead of /bin/login)."


For now I'm just trying to use it with telnetd so I'm not concerned with
getty for a serial-line login. My system uses this lines in /etc/inetd.conf:

"telnet  stream  tcp   nowait  root  /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.telnetd"

I've tried putting /sbin/ttysnoops at the end of this line in several ways
but just ended up messing up my telnetd service. I have a manpage for
telnetd but it doesn't indicate how I tell in.telnetd to use ttysnoops. I
don't have a manpage for in.telnetd.

Thanks for any help!
