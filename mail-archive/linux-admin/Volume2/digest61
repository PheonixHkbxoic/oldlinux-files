As far as I know, it's called freq. (At least on my machine :)
Look for speedstar-fix on sunsite (or its mirrors).

you must use 'export RZSZLINE=/dev/modem' in your shell,
where /dev/modem is a symbolic link to your modem device.

I don't know why this isn't documented.  Hope it works.

        The README.Linux file that comes with the copy of Doom that I
got from sunsite says that I can set the doom WAD directory by setting
an environment variable DOOMWADDIR to the directory which holds the
doom1.wad file.  I can't get this to work, but I'd like to install the
wad in a general location so that all users of my machine can play
doom easily.  Has anyone gotten this to work?

        Does the registered version check to see if more than one copy
of Doom is running on the same machine?

I guess you could save the login-shell's pid at the beginning of the

kill that shell when the time is elapsed...

Subject: 2.90 sound driver problem in 1.1.45
Date: 13 Sep 1994 10:42:25 -0500

   I've been using the 1.1.19 kernel for several months without a 
problem. Sound worked great for au files, mods, and cd audio, etc.

Last night I upgraded to 1.1.45/ 2.90 sound, and now if I
cat welcome.au > /dev/audio,  It plays but gives a write io error, then 
repeats part of the file, then quits.  Sound card is a PAS16, machine is 
a 486/40 vlb, 16MB.  When configuring the new kernel I chose not full 
package, PAS16, no SB, irq10, dma3, opl3, dig voice, 65536 bufs.

Also on an unrelated note, where can I find 1.1.50? I checked  the usual 
places, but I must be missing something.

Thanks,

No offense, but my opinion would be it doesn't.  I have a 386DX33 w/8M and 1MB 
graphics.  I can run it fine under DOS, but under Linux, it's sluggish.  Most 
of this is due to the sound.  In fact, the sound really kills it.

Concurrency control for ingres does not work on my system. I've tried
both the latest versions from sunsite and tsx-11. But whenever I try
to start up the daemon ingreslock, he dies. Compiling with the DEBUG

The services file is correct. 

My kernel is 1.0.8, gcc is 2.5.8 and libc is 4.5.24.

Has someone a working concurrency control for ingres ? Can someone give
me a hint where the problem is ?

Date: 13 Sep 1994 15:41:30 GMT

Judjung by some responses I got, I didn't make it very clear as to what 
the story is.

I have a registered class C network IP number. Both PC1 and PC2 to are 
hosts on this network. My Internet provider has his end set up so that 
all the packets for my network go to PC1.  I know they do indeed. But 
they do not seem to get past PC1 to PC2 even though it seems like PC1 
contains enough info to know where to send them. 

If ppp0 has an IP of, say, 199.0.0.1 and ppp1 was 199.0.0.2, then 
wouldn't it make sense for kernel to send (forward) a packet arriving 
from the Internet via 199.0.0.1 addressed to 199.0.0.2, to ppp1? 

I am not an expert on TCP/IP, so may be I'm missing something obvious. 

Anyhow, the original post follows:

That's the AppleDouble standard way to store the Mac file info. NFS/Share
(a NFS Mac client) also uses this scheme, as does A/UX (Apple's Unix for

Hopefully soon... NFS/Share doesn't work right if you do complex stuff.
(Files end up with holes ... ugh.) I haven't yet found out if this is a
problem of NFS/Share or of the Linux server.

Subject: NFS performance
Date: 13 Sep 1994 18:29:07 GMT

Hello all,

I have looked at a number of potential sources for help, all to no avail,
so here I go with a question for the net experts...

What is the best way to measure and then to optimize NFS performance?
Some specifics:

        Linux 1.1.50 on a not-too-busy subnet, mounting disks on another
                Linux box (also running 1.1.50 and the latest networking stuff)
                as well as on Suns.  Mount options are:
                rsize=8192,wsize=8192,async,hard,intr

        The 2 Linux machines seem subjectively to have very slow NFS
                performance (i.e. ls on a relatively small directory can take
                5-10 secs). Iozone says about 40k bytes/sec for writing, 90k
                for reading.

        Tcpspray shows similar numbers among all machines, so I don't
                suspect ethernet cards.  Rather, it seems that NFS is the
                culprit.


So, I'm asking what values people are getting for performance.
How do you test it?  Can you offer tips for improving it?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: login USERID length problem
Date: 12 Sep 1994 23:36:22 GMT

I think there is a serious problem in connection with 'login'.

Login doesn't work correctly when the login ID is > 8
characters AND you telnet or type 'login' at a console
*after* having logged in.
It gives a 'login incorrect' response.  This doesn't happen
when you login directly from the console.

I've had the same problem with kernels, 1.0.8, 1.1.35, and
1.1.45.

I'd be very happy if someone could shed light on this problem
because it is very embarrasing to tell people that they have
to restrict their login ID's to 8 characters (it smells of
MSDOS :=( ).

I am having the same problem.  I'm using PAS16, no SB, IRQ 7, DMA 3.  When I
run Doom I get error messages telling me I have a conflict.  The setup has
always worked fine under both DOS and Linux.  I am not convinced this is the
problem.

I don't think it works so easily. You'd better change your
/usr/lib/smail/config-file (I don't know if you can do it with the
configure-script or if you must do it by hand):

   more_hostnames=msheinz.psych.nat.tu-bs.de:mshilda.psych.nat.tu-bs.de

I have - for example - the line above in my config file to have one
single mail spool for two computers. Then the smail daemon recognises
both addresses as its own.

So long
