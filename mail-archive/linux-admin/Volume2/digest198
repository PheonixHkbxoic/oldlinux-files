I must disagree here. I was unable to overclock my AMD DX/2-66. Oh, sure..if 
you only run DOS it might fly, but not loaded down Windows, or OS/2. I know 
SOME people get away with it, but it was by no means gauranteed. I am now 
running an AMD DX/2-80 in the same machine with the same software.
        It is possible that the DX/2-80 is  simply a sampling of the "best" of the 
DX/2-66s that come off the line, but I would think it unlikely tht AMD is just 
wholesale relabling DX/2-66s to DX/2-80s.

According to c't (a German magazine) out today, there is a new chip
coming from AMD ('Q4 1994') which will be called DXL4 and will be
optionally a clock doubler or tripler. Clearly the number at the
end is 2 ** (doubling factor - 1) :-).

(This makes the new 300MHz (330 Specint) Alpha a sort of 'DX256',
assuming it runs externally with 33MHz.)

The DXL4 only goes up to 100MHz, if I remember correctly, and doesn't
have the accellerated multiply or enlarged 1st level cache of Intel's
DX4. That's not to say you can't overclock it if you put your PC in
a freezer...

Thought I would get in on this also . . . :-)

I saw in here one person post that they thought only one shell or the
other could be used to run shell programs out of cron.  So far, in my
experience with Linux, it appears that bash and ksh can be used.
However I ran into a weird one myself recently.

I have a cleanup program that rotates various log files and runs find
against certain directories to purge them of all outdated files
(e.g., /tmp).  Initially I used bash to execute this, and it worked
flawlessly from a login shell.  When run from cron though it would
only partially run.  To solve the problem, I switched the program to
using ksh and now it runs properly to completion.  

The problem seemed to come from the following sub-section of the code:

#########################################################################

while :
do
        read line
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]
        then
                break 1
        fi

        rotate $line

done < $LIST

IFS="${N_IFS}"

# Purge directories
echo ""
echo "Cleaning directories"
echo "===================="
echo ""

while :
do
        read line
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]
        then
                break
        fi

        purge $line

done < $PURGE

#########################################################################

The problem is that when run via cron, with bash executing these
statements, only the first while loop would complete, and then the
program would terminate.  Without changing any of the above code,
except to put "#!/bin/ksh" at the beginning, both loops would execute
properly.

So, is this a quirk of bash or of crond?

I'm using what appears to be bash v1.13.1 with Slackware 1.2, what
appears to be v2.1 of crond and a v1.1.12 kernel.  Not sure on the
versions of bash and crond as I pulled those numbers out of the
binaries with "strings".

Reply-To: Thomas.Koenig@ciw.uni-karlsruhe.de

Runlevels seem to be somewhat underused in current Linux distributions.

For example, it should be fairly easy to set up /etc/inittab so that
on level 4, there's multiuser capability (from different consoles),
but no networking.

This would take a couple of lines like

pm:5:once:/usr/sbin/rpc.portmap
in:5:once:/usr/sbin/inetd
nf:5:once:/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd 

in /etc/inittab, and (possibly) a little hacking of source code, if
services like nfsd should restart when they've aborted.  The superuser
then could terminate networking cleanly with /sbin/telinit 4.

Comments?

but factual.  DDS drives, if not fed for 5 seconds, will flush a 
DDS block (128k) to the tape.  thus you could construct a pessimal
system which writes one block (say, of zeroes, so it compresses
well), waits 5+e seconds, and repeats.  it would utilize very little
of the tape, but would consume at least 128k for each block...

comp.windows.x.i386unix:
I was wondering if I should stay on the beta team any longer, since
I have been too busy to send in any reports on XFree86.  (Yes, I am
still on the beta team.  You heard it here first.)  Guess I will.

But I don't think it's a beta issue or an XFree86 issue at all.
IMHO, it's pointless to point fingers.

comp.windows.x.motif:
The simple fact is that X and Motif are on different development cycles.
There are going to be incompatibilities between the two products,
and there are features in the newer one (X) that the older one (Motif)
cannot exploit.

For developing and compiling new applications, Motif 1.2.4 simply was
not designed to work in an R6 environment.  (I keep thinking of making
water run uphill.)  You cannot make Motif 1.2.4 use features of X11R6
it was not designed to use.  If you could, it probably would not be
Motif 1.2.4 any longer.

comp.os.linux.admin:
Whether XFree86-3.1's X libraries should or should not be compatible
with 2.1's, I don't know.  I've heard speculations both ways.  What I do
know is that the men doing the Linux shared X libraries have been doing
them for longer than a lot of us have been using Linux, so they should
know a thing or two about Linux shared libraries.  Plus, the XC bumped
the major version numbers.  I think they're trying to tell us something.
(But who knows, maybe not.  Our 1.2.3 was not compatible with our 1.2.2. :-( )

Some motherboards have the CPU mounted on the MB(non removable). Those

There is -- if your xterm allows for logging. See your respective menu

Someone breaks into your house, wanders around, then makes a few phone

Where do you draw the line? If someone breaks in, and I know who it is, 
I'm not going to simply "bounce them off" and forget about it. I'm going 
to make sure this person doesn't get the chance to do it again or worse.

Breaking into and poking around is bad enough, and I don't consider it 
"pathetic and fascist." I consider it secure. (Relatively secure, that 
is... if you want a truly secure machine, turn the power off, put it in a 
safe, and bury it in 6 feet of concrete.)

"Hacker" is not malicious at all... I would consider myself somewhat of a 
hacker. You're looking for the word "cracker." (I believe someone pointed 
the definitions out... check the jargon300.txt.gz at a GNU site.)

Now "Cracker" and "non-malicious-system-tourist" are the same, IMO, if 
the "tourist" got in by bypassing system security.

No, but breaking and entering is. Trespassing is. What is the difference 
whaehter they are breaking into your house and looking around, or 
breaking into your machine and looking around?

Subject: Booting different configurations ?
Date: 14 Oct 1994 14:18:57 GMT

  Hi all!

I am using Lilo for booting different Versions of the Kernel, as well as
MSDOS. But now I ran across the problem and want to know if there is
allready a solution to it:
I want to have two boot choices with the same kernel version, but
different software on startup, namely one configuration should
automatically start a SLIP connection. 
I suppose this to be done in one of the /etc/rc.d scripts (local or
inet). BUT, how do I pass some information to this scripts ? Using
different kernel versions and using uname isn't what I would like to do.

Thanks in advance,

   Peter
