I understand that it isn't necessary to change my - I think so - well done

Hm. Brings up the question if there's some reason left, to have such things

Well, I use this one, too. For now just for files of the filebase of my

For Dosemu0.52 stick with the old kernel or get a pre53-dosemu for a recent

As for a serial board, you might want to try the Cyclades.  It has RISC
processors on it.  They make an 8-port and a 16-port.  There is an article
abour the driver in Linux Journal #5.  You can contact Cyclades at

Subject: Re: XFree86-3.1 - Whoopee!
Date: 4 Oct 1994 19:47:56 GMT

the Linux binary distribution seems to contain LBX support,
but there is little (may I say no) documentation on how to
get it started. Anyway, ...

My Linux box runs X11R6 now, and I would like to start an
xterm on the Sun that it is connected to via CSLIP.

I tried:        rstart sun-hostname xterm
which complained that rstartd does not exist.
I interpret that to mean that "rstartd" does
not exist on the Sun (of course).

So the question is:
where can I get the necessary binaries and setup files
for SunOS 4.1.3 or Solaris 2.3 ?

Any help is appreciated.


BTW: XFree86 3.1 and XFree 2.1 co-exist without trouble
     on my machine. Here is a snapshot of the ld situation:

ldd `which xterm`
        libXaw.so.6 (DLL Jump 6.0) => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.6.0
        libXt.so.6 (DLL Jump 6.0) => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.so.6.0

Subject: shutdown without root access
Date: 4 Oct 1994 15:43:55 GMT

I am trying to set up my system so that others in my family can start
and stop it without root privileges.  The /etc/passwd I inherited from
the Slackware system installation included:

   sync::5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
   shutdown:*:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
   halt:*:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt

I suppose I should use shutdown to bring the system down, since it calls
halt.  When I tried logging in as 'shutdown', I was asked for a password
and of course nothing was accepted.  I removed the '*' from the entry in
/etc/passwd (so no password was needed), then got the message:

   shutdown: must be root.

Finally I changed '6' to '0' (so shutdown had the same userid as root),
and got a usage message:

   Usage:    shutdown [-krhnf] time [warning message]
                     -k:      don't really shutdown, only warn.
                     -r:      reboot after shutdown.
                     -h:      halt after shutdown.
                     -n:      don't sync before reboot or halt.
                     -f:      do a 'fast' reboot.
                     -c:      cancel a running shutdown.
                     -t secs: delay between warning and kill signal.
 
I then tried using the entry for halt.  When I removed the '*' from its
entry in /etc/passwd and tried logging in as 'halt', I got the message:

   -halt: can't idle init

Finally, I put this into /etc/inittab:

   # What to do at the "Three Finger Salute".
   ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -h now

This means I can't trigger a reboot from the keyboard - I have to
actually press the reset button.  No big deal.

My instructions to shut down the system are:
        1.  logout
        2.  press cntl-alt-del.

My questions for the net:
        Can you really run shutdown as a login shell?
        When would you log in as 'halt'?
        When would you log in as 'sync'?
        Is my method safe?  (filesystem damage, security, etc.)
        Is there a better way?

May be this will be helpful:

Size of NFS package should be 1024 only. As I know default is 8K for
SUN and other UNIXes. Unfortunately, I do not have demand to connect SUN 
to Linux, so I have not tried it. But MS-DOS NFS client (B&W) will give

I was just wandering if there is such a thing for Linux like I saw in
SunOS 4.1.3 in inetd.conf:

ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/bin/identify ftp-ident -b -i /usr/etc/in.ftpd
telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/bin/identify telnet-ident -b -i /usr/etc/in.telnetd

I noticed that since sysadmin put that "identify" in there is more info about 
the user that does telnet or ftp to a host in /var/adm/messages
I also tried man pages but there weren't any.
So if anybody knows if there is such a thing for Linux and where to
get it please post it.

Thanx,

Subject: Re: LILO and BT445s
Date: 4 Oct 1994 16:28:08 GMT

Okay, I got the two to like each other.  Thanks to everyone who sent me (an
incredibly diverse myriad of) answers.

The solution for me was to a) make sure I was using a kernel >= 1.1.46 as
that's where changes were made to the partitioning tables that are *not*
backward compatible and b) make sure that I used a version of [c]fdisk
that's newer (so there's support for the new kernel shme) and actually had
it write out the partition table information even though I didn't change
any of the partitioning information (this was key, of course, to update the
tables).

After that everything worked just fine.  Note that I didn't have to change
anything on the board itself (like the wacko DOS > 1 GB jumper/switch) nor
doing any bizarre things to the driver itself, nor reconfigure LILO itself.

Thanks again,
                John

P.S.    The Plextor 4-Plex quad speed CD-ROM drive wasn't being recognized
        by the kernel because on that machine the BT445s is set to use
        I/O port 130 rather than 330 and the current driver doesn't support
        the use of that (and some other) address.  Sigh. [Digging through
        BusLogic's manuals for the fix now...]
