Hi all. I'd think this is the right group to ask, but if not, please
point me in the right direction..

I have a few linux boxes on our network, and everything was going fine.
Then, when some guys in the building across from us (but on the same
net) were trying to install a netblazer, three of these broadcast as
128.186.7.255, when their addresses are 128.186.7.x, where x <> 255.

I tried running install.net again, but nothing. I changed the netmask
from 2 to three octects -- nothing. To tell the truth, I'm stumped.

The machines aren't running exactly the same configurations, but they
all run the 1.0.4 kernel, the one that comes with MCC 1.0+.

Any help, or hyper-help would be helpful (read VERY helpful..),

In the INVOCATION section I find

.PP
If Bash is invoked as
.BR sh ,
it tries to mimic the behavior of
.B sh
as closely as possible.  For a login shell, it attempts to
source only
.I /etc/profile
and
.IR ~/.profile ,
in that order.  The
.B \-noprofile
option may still be used to disable this behavior.
A shell invoked as
.B sh
does not attempt to source any other startup files.

Suggestions for improvement may be sent to chet@po.cwru.edu.

This should be in the FAQ!

There is a cyclic reference in the application default files.

XFig calls XFig-color, XFig-color calls XFig, until all memory is exhausted.
Have a look at them.

Please read the original question more carefully.  The poster asked
about AIX 3.2.5, not Linux.  He did crosspost the question to more
newsgroups than Uncle Scrooge owns dimes :-)

For my taste, neither Linux nor AIX are real Unixes anyway ...

Sorry for the followup, but I should have mentioned that in all cases I
was running DOOM in high detail with the largest screen you can get
without losing the mode line at the bottom, and I'm using the registered
WAD with those demos.

I do have a lot of swapping going on.  I only had X, fvwm, and 3 xterms
running though: I'm not sure how I could trim things down further...  I
did put the WAD onto my ext2 filesystem instead of pointing to it on my
DOS filesystem.  Maybe I'll try the shareware WAD and see what happens.

Nope! There is no bug in apsfilter 3.01, aöö what might result in a
few problems is that there are bsd-binaries included, namely a2ps and

All you have to do is to remove them and recompile the correct bins

Whatever you do, if you have DOS data on the first partition NEVER run

Unless I'm wrong you should be able to use DOS fdisk to make the next
partition but use Linux to format it.

For future reference: anyone know if DOS "fdisk /mbr" will recover from
what I did to my hard drive with Linux? It's too late for my drive now; I
reformatted it Sunday, and Linux is never seeing my computer again, but
just for the info...

The problem was that the app-defaults file for Xfig (Fig-color)

Mark,

Subject: 1.1.45 "stops" occasionally
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 1994 11:57:42 GMT


Hi folks...
Here's my sad story :(

I upgraded from 1.1.18 to 1.1.45 and immediately patched all the
way to 1.1.49.  Everything seemed to be running fine.  A few days
later I grabbed 1.1.50 and installed that.  Then, after about a day
or so, the system just suddenly stopped.  Dead.  Keyboard, network,
modem (was receiving at the time) all just died.  Reset Time!  Since
I was in X at the time, I couldn't see any warning messages and
~adm/messages didn't seem to capture them.

So I did what anyone would do.  I went back to 1.1.49 and (basically)
the same thing happened.

I *believe* that after one of these halts (it took about 4 before
I was convinced) I saw "Oops" from the kernel just as I rebooted.
(You know, just as you reboot and the video card flips back to page
one you can see what *was* there...)  Unfortunately that was all
I could see and haven't seen it since.

So then I went all the way back to 1.1.45.  That was all going great
for a couple of days.  But then, as I was reading news under X, everything
just quit again!  My plan was to confirm that 1.1.45 was OK and then
install all the way to 1.1.50, letting each one run for a few days to
see if it would die.  Unfortunately, now that 1.1.45 has died I'm at a loss.

BTW:  1.1.18 ran for two weeks or so before I started the upgrade.
It never seemed to have a problem

Has anyone else had any problems?  I haven't seen any on the net...

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Here is my hardware:

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am really mistified at the wide range of frame rates on machines that seem
to be so simmilar.

My results:

With Sound:      15.8 FPS
Without Sound: 17.4 FPS

Setup:

488DX2/66 clock to 80
2MB ET4000/W32p VLB card using X86_SVGA server ( NON-accel !)
Gravis Ultrasound  w/1MB
Doom on Largest screen setting ( in game menu )
16MB RAM, 16MB swap ( on an old slow conner drive )
 

Needless to say, I experience no slowdown between Linux and Dos version,
in fact, it seems to run a little faster under Linux

Hi,

Using term, you could have tin -r setup in your nntpserver to connect to
localhost, which is 127.0.0.1.

Also, no one would be able to telnet or ftp to your box unless you
redirect a port on his box, which, to anyone wanting to get into your
box, would have to know the port number you've used, while still having
to telnet or ftp to his box *first* ie: telnet your.internet.provider:4023.

If you arbitrarily assigned yourself an address, no one would be able to
find you, as term does not do any broadcasting (as far as I know). And
you would *not* be able to redirect any of *his* reserved ports.

Therefore, you would not be able to snatch any packets destined for
your host machine addressed the "normal" way.

I don't see any foundation for his worries here, (with respect to term
and his box) except for not knowing exactly what term is.

Hope this helps.

P.S. I suggest using term 2.0 and higher, it now supports udp packets
     and port redirecting. (also allows shared mode.)
