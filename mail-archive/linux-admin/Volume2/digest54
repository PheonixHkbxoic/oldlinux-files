slackware 2.0 comes with a mousetest utility if you installed the
svgalib stuff...

/usr/lib/svgalib/mousetest is the usual location..

I know this is stupid but:

What is the command I use to patch the kernel?

I typed

cd /usr/src/
patch </tmp/patch##

everything seems to have worked (no .rej files, no errors)
but the source will not compile (says it can't find a file...)


Also,

 What command do I use to compiler GCC iPentium? I want to run some
benchmarks with the kernel compiled for a pentium :)

Subject: Bus Logic SCSI Problem
Date: 12 Sep 1994 09:56:16 -0400

I hope this is the right newgroup for this question, and 
if it isn't, please no flames - just let me know and I'll
take my business elsewhere (did I just create a new word?) 

First my system:
TI 486-40 motherboard with 2 VESA VL-Bus slots with 20MB 
ram.  Generic full height 5.25" 630MB scsi hard drive.
Linux v. 1.0.9 and XFree 2.1.1.

Before I got this motherboard I had a 386-DX 33 without 
the local bus, so I had an Adaptec ISA controller card 
with floppy controller on the card.  So, when I got my 
new board I just put the Adaptec in the VL-Bus slot.  
My friend who let me use his Adaptec needs it back, but 
said would let use a Bus Logic SCSI 2 VL-Bus card in my 
machine. 

He got himself a new card so he let me use his old Adaptec.
It worked fine for him, and Linux had no problems with it.

After replacing the card and rebooting, I get this error
message (It comes up right after the BogoMIPS message):

(Part of the message scrolls off the screen, so this is all
I can read)

MINI-fs: unable to read superblock

and then it just hangs :(  Do I need to reformat the
hard drive with the Bus Logic card?  I am going to 
back it up to a QIC drive tonight, before I do anything.

Thanks for the help.  Sorry for the long post, but I wanted
to give as much info as possible.

OK- I have both MS-"DOS" and Linux DOOM.  My machine is a 486 33 DX with
16 MB of 0 wait X 32 RAM.  Adaptec 16 bit SCSI controller, Orchid
Pro Designer II ET-4000 16bit SVGA card, Sound Blaster Original, etc.

The game absolutely flies under MS-"DOS", I can't even tell how many
frames per second, but at least 6.

The game is completely unplayable under Linux, with a frame rate of 0.5
per second (the is the fastest in 640x480 X, in 1024x768 it is slower).

So, the "requirement" for local bus/accelerated video is no joke.....

Hmmm...  You should be getting better performance than that.  Are you
playing with or without sound in the Linux version?  (Then again, you should
also be getting more than 6 fps out of the DOS version...)

Without sound, the Linux and DOS version of Doom are almost identical
speed-wise on my home machine (486DX50, 16MB+32MB swap, FD 1680 SCSI +
separate IDE card for DOS, no-name OEM 90c30-based ISA video, and PAS-16).
I'd guess I get between 15 and 20 fps under Linux in 1024x768.  Play is
somewhat slower on my machine at work (486DX33, similar memory, IDE
disk only, S3-based VLB video, and no sound).  I haven't recompiled my
1.1.0 kernel with the 2.90-2 sound drivers, so I don't know how much
sound slows things down.

YMMV, of course.

As far as I know^*, Overdrive is the same as a DX/2-66. The only
difference is that the Overdrive is ment for the normal user to replace
an old 486-CPU and therefor has a cooler fixed on the processor, whereas
the 'plain' DX/2 doesn't have this feature (here, the manufacturer has
to take care for enough cooling)
If you buy your own fan/cooler/icecap, getting the plain DX/2 should be
cheaper than the Overdrive.

You probably do not have the SAME kernel on the floppy, that you have on your HD.

Get the MCC distribution. Built at Manchester Computing Center for their Unix
and C classes, it fits on 8 HD disks containing all these essentials (kernel,
gcc, print stuff, tcp/ip networking, flex, gawk, gprof, kermit, emacs (!!), 
gdbm, ...). It is small, compact and reliable. Just great.

I used it in late April and have installed everything else on top of it 
at great ease. It comes with a superb Installation Manual (called 
"interim" in .dvi or postscript or ascii format.
You find everything at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/distributions/MCC/1.0+/
The doc is in distributions/MCC/1.0+/documentation/

Here's an example of my .xinitrc - that's the file I use to start X and
load xprogs auto:

fvwm &
xearth &
xld &  - a bin file that loads xload and sets fn/bg colors and geometry
xclk & - ditto for xclock
exec xterm -C name console -fn 9x15bold -fg blue


This is from memory, but pretty much does it. For an xterm you can create 
a bin file that calls the xterm, sets the colors and geometry and then call
the file in the .xinitrc. Hope this helps.

What do you mean?  Elvis performance under X or elvis performance on
console or curses performance under X/console?

Elvis does not use curses, it has its own terminal interface.  This is
*very* fast on Linux the console.  However, in an X-Term, scrolling is
very slow when you do not have accelerated video, and that affects the
insertion and deletion of lines with elvis.

This is a rookie question so be thus advised:

I have been using Linux for 4 days now and am impressed.  However, I can only 
get my system to recognize my CDROM (Mitsumi) when I boot off floppy.  I did 
the entire installation and have ran the configure option that is in the setup 
program.

Is there someplace that I need to move a file or something???  Please help...  

Second problem:

I cant get the X windows stuff to work.  When I use any of several Xconfig 
files that are set up for my exact hardware, I get an error saying something 
about No Graphics Device Defined (Something like that).

Your help is greatly appreciated.

In the doc directory of the Linux archive sites (sunsite.unc.edu:

Subject: Putting Linux on 20 PC's at a Time
Date: Mon, 12 Sep 1994 17:18:39 GMT

I have 5 classrooms with 20 PC's in each classroom. (Different
make/model/everything in each classrooom. No CD-ROM drives).
We plan on teaching on DOS one week, Linux the next, going back at
forth on a weekly basis. So we need to rebuild on a weekly basis.
Some of the classrooms have a Novell sever, others are Windows NT,
and the new ones coming up will have Windows for Workgroups. 
Rebuilding DOS is not my problem, Linux is. 

What I had planned for the initial install of Linux was
Step 1: boot from  the scsinet and umsdos144 disks
Step 2: fdisk 
Step 3: run a modified 'setup' script with my answers already in there
        [since setup is a shell script I can modify it]
Step 3: mount a partition from a UNIX box (HP or Sun)
Step 4: un'tar dumps made to the UNIX partition

A similar process could be used to rebuild the Linux stuff after the
class. (Classes are in System Adminstration so a rebuild is
necessary).

I'm open to ideas on how to do the initial install better, but with
the above scheme my first problem is with  Step 2: fdisk
fdisk is menu driven, which would be a pain to do 20 times in
a row, especialy since I'll be doing the same partitions each time.
