The kernels built with the Slackware 2.0 package shipped in the
current Infomagic CDROM is using the old drivers.  They are not
compatible with the current released code.

The kernel.tgz file has been updated some weeks ago (Jul 10, I
believe) to correct the problem. Copies of Slackware 2.0 obtained
after that date are just fine for PPP.

Please do not use ppp-2.1.2.tar.gz. Use ppp-2.1.2a.tar.gz. The "a"
modification is there for a reason. The first release of the pppd
process caused an error that the SIOCSIOSIG ioctl was invalid.

Other than that, you will have to be more explicit than "unable to get
PPP to work". What is in the syslog trace for the pppd process? What
version of the kernel are you using?

He said he felt it was a waste of time and money.  He didn't say you

First, I fail to see why you must use GD in a net posting.  I see no need
for you to post your lack of respect for God.

Second, the original poster was questioning the relevancy of Doom postings
to comp.os.linux.admin, an issue you failed to address.

Try gslp. It should be included in the ghostscript distribution; try
running gslp or looking at /usr/lib/ghostscript/gslp.ps. The
documentation is almost nonexistent, but try out the options yourself...

There are other similar programs too; look at the
comp.sources.postscript FAQ (FTP rtfm.mit.edu:
/pub/usenet/comp.sources.postscript).

>Error: /invalidfileaccess in --.outputpage--

Hmm... What are the permissions for /dev/lp1?
Can you cat or echo to it? (i.e. echo Testing >/dev/lp1)

Anyway, I suggest installing lpr, it's much more convenient to use. Look
into the Printing-HOWTO for details...

csmith@convex.com (I think) wrote HPFS for linux. When I asked him he pointed
out that write access to HPFS is a very difficult thing when you want to
do it right (fragmentation, performance ...), and he didn't know if he would
have the time to figure out how OS/2 does it, because IBM didn't release
any information about HPFS - the only official document that exists by now
is the some years old one by Microsoft.
I think it helps us much more if someone continues the work on ext2fs for OS/2.

I'm running  xdm also (Slackware-2.0, Linux-1.1.50,  XFree86-2.1.1) and I
shut down with

     1. switching to console (Ctrl-Alt-F1)

The system goes correctly down, with no errors on next boot.

You can get it at sunsite, I believe. Look in pub/Linux/apps/games/adventure/
doom - I THINK that's the place. BTW, I got the package and ran the scripts
to replace the /dev/dsp and then cp'd the .new to the old sndserver, but I'm
still not getting sound. I have an SBPRo, kernel 1.1 on Ygg Sum '94. Works
fine for sound w/ audio cd's using xplaycd. Doom runs fine. but even with
sndcvt running, I getting zip on sound. Any suggestions? TIA

I had the exact same problem trying to compile 1.1.18.  I decided
to jump ahead to 1.1.45 since it was available as a tar file.  I had
no trouble compiling 1.1.45.

Subject: BBS-like file downloading? How?
Date: Fri, 23 Sep 1994 15:27:24 GMT


        There's been talk before on another thread (which has now mutated 
into some other topic) about getting some sort of BBS-like 
file-downloading system working under Linux for those of us running a BBS.

        Several of you had some idea's I'd like to explore now. I tried 
using PSC Menu (which I'm using as my main interface for users), but it 
was too awkward.

        I have a CD-ROM, which I'd like to give users access (once I put 
a shareware disc in.) What I need is something to make it easier for them 
to select files, a protocol, and show them descriptions of what each file 
is (without having them view a "directory" file.) Anyone have any ideas? 
How is Gopher or Lynx used this way? Is anyone currently porting a MSDOS 
"file door" to Linux (which I think would be ideal.)

Date: 23 Sep 1994 18:27:31 GMT

I am running the 1.1.49 kernel of Linux.  I got 2.1.2a of ppp from the
net and built and installed.

Now the questions:
    There are files that are referenced in /etc/ppp, but I can't find 
        examples of the files...
    There are many readme and SETUP, Notes, etc files, but they all seem
        to talk about what is needed to setup/install ppp and what needs to
        be done withour reference to the others.... I am confused,,,

(My Linux box will use a modem to call a Sun [SunOS 1.4.*].  The Sun will
have separate entries in the /etc/passwd for different ppp dialups.  Then
when the system connects, a person can run csh (or your favorite) or exec
a script for the person dialing up to run ppp.  The Sun is connected to
a network that that is 'hooked' to Internet.  The goal is is to have my
Linux box 'on the net' using ppp.... easy huh?

Any help on getting PPP running is appreciated.

I'm trying to setup this WD90c33 also with no luck.  The best so far 
was forcing the SVGA server to think the card was a WD90c30 (Non Accel)
in 640x480 and still the image wasn't perfect.  I like to make it work 
with the WD90c31 accelerated option of this server.

How about if some one would post a working Xconfig for this card.

Subject: Help : Still having printer problems
Date: Sun, 25 Sep 1994 13:08:20

            I have been trying to get my HP Deskjet 520 to work for about 
three weeks now. Thanks to kind folks on the net I have a collection of 
printcaps and filters. I have read the printer how-to from cover to cover and 
have read portions of a UNIX systems administration book. I have tried 
recompiling the kernel of slackware ver 2.0, several different printcaps and 
filters and even changed jumpers for my parallel port. 
          The same problem occurs no matter which of these methods I try:
              
         1. The kernel polls the printer port as lp1
         2. The printer will print when output is redirected "ls > /dev/lp1"
         3. The printer daemon will not start with /dev/lp1 in the printcap
         4. The printer daemon will start with /dev/lp2 in the printcap, but
             tells me that it is waiting for the printer to come on line.

This problem also occurs if my printer port is set for lp0, only I must set 
the printcap entry to  /dev/lp1 to start the daemon. Lp1 is at 0x378 and lp0 
is at 0x3bc when the hardware card is set for either one. I only have one 
parallel port. My best guess is that lpd is messed up or one or more of my 
device drivers is messed up. I you could help I would appreciate. Please keep 
in mind that I'm an idiot when it comes to device drivers, sockets, etc..

My current configuration:

486dx50 EISA
Adaptec 1742A (enhanced, floppy enabled)

Also would that allow me to use my floppies while doing a backup?

Seems that after using my tape, I often get problems (SF, mtab~,,,) with 
the floppies.

thanks
andre
