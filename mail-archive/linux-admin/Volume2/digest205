I have got the kernel 1.00 running and the chance to get an Future Domain
SCSI-1 All in One plus (with TMC-950) or a SCSI-2 All in One (with TMC-1800)
quite cheap. Now I wonder if anyone has got any experience with one of them
- most important if they are supported or not (the doc is not fully clear -
it says "Seagate .../Future Domain ... TMC-950" with some problems, "Future
Domain 16x0 with TMC-1800" - I don't know if the SCSI-2 board is compatible
with any 16x0 board).

Sorry if this question was treated here already - I've just joined the group
(yeap, I know - strongly against netiquette).
And again against netiquette: Could you please answer through Email as my
newsfeed isn't too stable at the moment and I could easily miss an article.
I'll post a summary if something of common interest arrives.

Thank you very much for any help!

Bye,
Thomas

The point of runlevels, beyond basic single/multiuser, is dependent on
your configuration.  For most installations I think you'd find that
multiuser without networking is meaningless.

For just simple stuff, like twm and xterm, 3.1 runs noticeable faster.
Much of this however could be do to changes in the Mach32 driver.

One important thing I've noticed is problems recompiling under 3.1

Any ideas how I can _neatly_ fix this system?

I think this is no video card problem. The line

tells about a client error. Perhaps there is something wrong in
$HOME/.xinitrc or in the global xinit file.

But there is another possibility: Be sure that your mouse is correctly
installed. X tries to initialize it and if the entry in XConfig is
wrong or the mouse is not connected, you get this error (its error 0...).

To the error
> XIO :fatal IO error(Broken pipe) on X server ":0.0"
> after 386 requests(390 known proceeed) with 0
> events remaning.
: This message will always appear when you shutdown the Xserver but
you have running clients on this server. Maybe the last entry
in your ~/.xinitrc is fvwm, the window manager. If you kill him with
'exit fvwm', the Xserver will be shutdowned. If there is a xterm
running this client will announce you the message showed above.

Hope that helps,

I got the same drive (isn't it a small mean little black box? :-) and
I get those "HD timeout" too. But never the other errors.

The reason (in my case at least), is that the drive has to spin up
after the power-saving has done it's job. The whole systems freezes for
about a second, then everything is fine again. This was discussed on
the KERNEL-channel a while ago. Don't know if it'll be fixed or not.

I am using the full capacity without problems (fdisk complains, but that
is no "real" problem). I only use it for Linux though.

Perhaps this information on size limitations could be added to Matt Walsh's

You can use a shell script to do zless:

========== cut cut cut ==============
#!/bin/sh
for args
do
   zcat $args | less
done
========== cut cut cut ==============

Save this as a file called zless, and do a chmod 755 on it to make it

You're out of luck. The kernel must be built to support the PPP devices.
In addition, the pppd process must be run from root or suid to root to
allow the ioctl operations needed to establish the PPP connection.

If the remote admin did not suid the pppd process to root then there is
nothing that you can do to make it so.

You will be able to use the term link.

From what I hear, there is a Linux port of "TIA" in the plans. This would
give you natural SLIP and (probably by that time) PPP.

rusers doesn't connect directly to the rusersd. It first contacts the portmap
to see if rusersd is registered, and asks what port it is on. When you run
rpc.rusersd it registers itself with the portmap. You have to start up all
your rpc services manually, not with inetd.
