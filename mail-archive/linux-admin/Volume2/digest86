Subject: Term-rlogin setuid-root: security hole?
Date: 20 Sep 1994 19:30:37 GMT

I grabbed the pre-compiled RLOGIN binary off the bohr.physics... site,
and found that it did not work properly in "shared" mode (i.e. it
wouldn't find the TERM socket except when run from the account that
started TERM, or by root).  Making rlogin setuid-root fixes this, and
things seem to work perfectly: when rlogin'ing to a remote system, the
user name that gets passed through is that of whoever runs TERM, not
root.

So, it seems to work great, but am I opening myself up to any security
holes by doing this?  I've checked for the obvious ones already (it
won't let you rlogin as root to localhost without a password, etc.),
but is there something I'm overlooking?

Thanks,

Then you have been told wrong information! GNU finger and process

Rather, there are several different patches for GNU finger-1.37
to make in compilable. I don't remember which one I used, but it

If you take a look at the "program" option you will be able to see how floppies 
may be (u)mounted relatively eaisly. Robert Sanders kindly sent me some scripts
to do just this with the automounter, and I promised him I would add this to any

Try GNU finger.  It's supposed to compile out of the box if you got
accounting installed. If not, like me, you can apply a patch that
can be found on sunsite.

GNU finger is found at your favourite ftp site for GNUware.

    Is there anybody who knows about support under linux for an
    Emerald Systems 9000 Tape Streamer? The Drive and interface
    card look like an ordinary QIC-02 tape subsystem (card and
    tape streamer). 
    
    Additional information:

    - According to the documentation the drive is an
        Emerald Series 150-9000

    - The card address can be set by 4 dip, where the irq is fixed
      to 5 and the dma to 3.

    - The drive works perfectly under DOS with the supplied software
      named asd and asdiags.

    - The tape subsystem does always report "tpqic02: Reset failed!"
      If any of the available tpqic02 drives are selected. (Wangtek,
      Archive or Mountain).

    - The Drive head does reposition, together with a short blink of
      the drive LED, every time /sbin/qic02conf is given to install the
      drive parameters to the drive port, irq and dma.

Subject: problems with connecting..
Date: 20 Sep 1994 11:44:14 GMT

I have this small problem.. it seems that i can't connect to my own pc 
with any consistancy. I can connect out everytime, but when i try to 
connect via ethernet, either when i use telnet it says connection established,
but no login appears. It also appears that any other service that is run via 
inetd suffers this problem, it connects but does not run the appropriate 
daemon. The twist is that when i type inetd from the prompt _everything_ 
from then on works fine until a random time later when it decides to not 
work anymore :(. I am running slackware 2.0 with a 1.1.50 kernel with a 
ne2100 compatible ethernet card, also the /etc/rc.d/* file are pretty 
much as they were when they were installed (except for ip's,gateways,etc)
One last thing, would recompiling inetd and accompanying daemons fix this 
problem? I have heard that recompiling can sometimes fix problems with 
software made with later kernels. Any help/patches/fixes would come in 
most handy...thanks..

I just setup pre53_20. It's working pretty well. 

When I do "dos -AX" the dosemulator starts up in a nice "Dos in a Box"
window. I was able to run Telix (a dos telecom program) in the window.
I can't seem to figure out how to get backspace & delete to work in
this window. When I logged onto a remote system with Telix the backspace and
arrow keys worked normally. Does anyone have a hint on how to fix this?

The other problem is booting from the hdimage file. When I do "dos -CX" then
the emulator starts up in the original xterm rather than opening "Dos in a
Box".  I could use a clue on this one too.

Thanks for any help!

We use the following script to shutdown Linux PCs:

  echo -e "UNTIL IT SAYS 'The system is halted'\n\r" >/dev/tty1

X dies, you return to console 1, and the text is on the screen. Then it says
'Sending SIGTERM...' and so on, and finally 'The system is halted.' I know I
shouldn't call halt directly, but it works fine that way. 

Another nice trick is to put this is xdm/Xstartup:

  if [ "$USER" = "halt" ]; then
    /usr/local/bin/xhalt            # this is above script
    exit 1
  fi

Add a user halt to /etc/passwd with no shell. Then anybody sitting at the
X11 console can login as halt with a password and shut down. We use this to
let users shut down their desktop machines without getting root access.

Shouldn't shutdown make sure that it does not kill itself?

I believe he said he was using Slackware 1.0... what kernel?  and also, if the
parallel printer driver is not compiled in, he won't be able to use it anyway.

I believe the solution here is to have a look at your kernel config, compile
in parallel printer support if it's not already there, and hope for the best.

BTW, are the plip ports laid out the same?  

ie.
        lp0 => plip0

I would go the dip route.  It provides SLIP which is, in my experience, a bit
more stable than ppp in the later kernels.  This will work only if your 
Internet Service Provider allows slip connections.  Menuing is handled by some
funky DOS client ( :) ).  Using your system as just another node on the 'net

Howdy.

I have recently set up Linux (for the first time) and have actually had
pretty good luck.  I have one major problem (I think it's only one) that
has me stumped.  First, here is the setup:

Kernel 1.0.9 (from slackware CD-Rom, recompiled with everything I need)
running on a 486 DX50 8MB mem 16MB swap partition
Using Dip version 3.3.7-uri to connect using a USR Sportster 28.8 V.FC
(waiting for the V34 upgrade :)
X-Free86 Ver 2.1 in standard VGA mode (while monitor gets fixed)

Ok, here is the problem...I CAN'T See myself!

I am using a dynamic CSLIP interface to the UF netork, and that works
fine (I can ping any host out there and get my stats, and xterms,
netrek, and _almost_ all of the apps I try work fine).  My problem is
that if I do a 'ping localhost' or 'ping DittoHead' (my host name - go
ahead and flame, I don't care) or 'ping slip-c12.cis.ufl.edu', I get
this:

DittoHead:/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults> ping slip-c11
PING slip-c11 (128.227.224.231): 56 data bytes
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
ping: wrote slip-c11 64 chars, ret=-1
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
ping: wrote slip-c11 64 chars, ret=-1

--- slip-c11 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
 
I THINK I set all of the information in the hosts, networks, etc
correctly, but something is missing.  The main reason I want this is
that xmosaic will not run.  I get an error saying that it can't get my
local address.

Any ideas?  I thought about the netmask, but it is set in hosts as
255.255.255.0 !

Thanks for any help...

Are A, B, and C all on the same IP network?  If so there is one answer.
If not, there is another.

>    networks, subnets of one network, or one network? In other words,

The simplest setup is to do routing and subnetting between a SL/IP network
and your ethernet network.  You will need two IP networks for this
(they needn't have the same sized netmasks, nor need they distinct, but the
case of overlapping networks gets a little more complicated to setup right).

If you are trying to do this with one IP network, then there are two solutions:
a specific host route, or proxy arp.  You can add a specific host route to your
ethernet network that basically says route all packets to A to machine B.  Then
machine B can know that A is at the other end of its SL/IP line when SL/IP
is running, and transfer the packets appropriately.  Proxy arp will
esentially do the same thing, except that machine B will "proxy" itself as
machine A by using its own ethernet address for packets destined machine A.
When B gets those packets, it then routes them over the SL/IP line to machine
A.

The cost for the two different methods: Static host routing, some
machine must publish the static route to B (it could be machine B itself if
it is allowed to publish routes, otherwise it is the router for the ethernet
network that B & C are on).  Proxy Arp, needs some machine to publish the
artificial arp address for machine A so that it points to machine B.  Again,
it could be machine B, or some other machine on the network.

IP forwarding is needed (I think) if you are using different IP networks.

> 4) Is B considered to be a 'gateway' to C from A (& vice versa), or is
>    A through B to C considered to be a 'direct' route?

B is a gateway only if different IP networks are being used.  When proxy arp
is being used, then A is considered part of a direct route (only B knows
that it isn't, and B handles that case right for you).

Disclaimer:  I am not a network expert, but I have (at different times)
configured parts of my network at work using different IP networks, and
using proxy arp.  However, I have never actually made a linux box be the
gateway machine (at work, I do have that setup working at home, however,
I no longer have a real IP network at home, so I am now using 192.0.2.0, and
we all know that you can't (shouldn't) route packets to/from that network
elsewhere).  I have used a DOS 286 PC running KA9Q sucessfully, and an
annex terminal server as well.  (The reason I haven't used Linux has to do
with a lack of the right kind of PC at work, not with my reluctance to do it.)
