Subject: Major Slip problems 
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 94 21:11:08 GMT

Hello All,

        I am having major Slip problems.  The remote host that I am 
connecting to and my local host are apparently not getting along.  Okay,
here is the situation.  

1) /sbin/dip /etc/connection.dip
        ---> this dials the remote host.
2) I receive a message saying "CONNECTED remote ip-address ---> local ip-address"
3) telnet remote host
4) I receive a message saying "Trying ..."
5) After 3 to 5 minutes of waiting it gives me a message saying, "unknown host"
6) However, when I pickup the phone, I hear the connection.
7) Then I begin to cuss!

I do a netstat -r and I do see that my remote host is listed under the
gateway category.  Go figure?  Then I simply do a netstat after the
telnet and I see the SYN GET (or something like that) indicating that
they are still trying to connect with each other.

Has anyone out there had to deal with a problem similiar to this one?
Does anyone have a clue to what is going on?  Could someone send me
an example of how there *.dip scripts and anything related to the 
local and remote host info (Of course, minus the info. such as a vital
password or a site that they don't want to share)?

Signed,
Pretty Desperate!!!
Thanks!
Keith

Hmm.  I'm about to purchase a tape drive for use w/ Linux.  But I'm

Hi!

I have a PAS16 and 1542CF. I tried some bus on/off times (in the aha1542.c
driver) and found out, that the PAS worked great when the 1542 was near
300KB/sec transfer speed. (Don't ask me for the parameters, I only tried a little
but don't know them any more.) 

You can use the PAS with lower sample rate (ca. 22KHz Stereo, 8Bit) in normal
work. But when you have much hard disk acces the sound stops again.

Until now I found no solution to this problem.

I've got the same problem with an Orchid Kelvin 64. I think the X
server uses some of the font-area on the card. As a hack I run setfont
after leaving X. Don't do this on a VC whilst X is still running;
things crash.

Reply-To: Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk (Ted Harding)

I would like to be able to send mail (using smail) which appears to
come "From" a pseudo-user other than the real user who created the mail.
(For instance, my mail "smarthost" expects me to be called "efh",
whereas I can be other things on my Linux machine). I've tried fiddling
with the config file, to no avail; maybe some other files should be
configured. So far all mail has to be created as real user "efh",
or "cb" (see below).

I'd like to be able to be real user (e.g.) "ted" or "root" and send
mail as "efh".

While we're at it, my wife is known to the smarthost as "cb" and so
it would also be nice if she could be pseudo-user "cb", whatever her real
uid on our Linux machine may be. Can both options be configured in?

If anyone knows how to do this I'd be much obliged to hear about it.

  Has anyone developed any scripts to confirm the installation of a slackware
disk set or package?
  I'm re-installing this distribution from scratch and have had the setup
program flash a few segmentation errors during execution.  There are no other
meaningful error messages.  Rather than just repeating the procedure and 
trusting that no error messages means that everything went as it was supposed
to, I'd like to be able to confirm it based on the installation script.  This
is a bit much to do by hand however.
  Has anyone tackled this?

I have kernel 1.0.9 and the 2.90 drivers compiled all right.  I have full

  I use the same IRQ and DMA for the PAS16 under DOS and Linux does the card

When Linux boots I see this:

Welcome to Linux 1.1.18.
hostname login:

and it waits for someone to login.  This is fine, but I would rather
have Linux boot into X and show somekind of dialog box prompting for
login id and password.  I don't need a window manager running or
anything.  Actually, I'd rather not have one running and let the
~/.profile load one.

My attempt:
I modified /etc/rc.d/rc.local and added the line
xinit -position =+100+150 -e login
I think it's -position, but I forget.  If not, it's whatever does that.
This works, but when the user logs in and enters 'mwm&', it says display
not found.

Attempt #2:
Modified /etc/rc.d/rc.local and added the line
startx
Then I added a login command to the root menu in the system.mwmrc to run
a xterm -e login.  This worked fine, but if the user asks for a generic
xterm, they get a window with a root account!  In addition, the .mwmrc
file in the user's home directory is ignored (because mwm is already
running).

The results are the same with every window manager I tried (mwm, fvwm,
olwm, etc.).  Also when the user logs out with the above attempts, X
exits and goes back to the name login: prompt.  I simply want it to show
the 'login dialog box' again.

Help, thanks.

I have a funny feeling PC's do not have that capability built into the hardware
that would alert the OS of an event with the floppy.

The Macintosh does however.

Due to security reasons we have disabled the finger from outside
of our machine. Now if someone tries to finger they get the 
message " connection refused ", which some people find annoying.

I have noticed that some people have found a nice solution to this.
When a person fingers their machine they provide some helpful
information on who to send email to get information on the machine
etc. For example finger @sgi.com gives the following result :

=============
 For information about Silicon Graphics, please call (415) 960-1980.
 
 For information concerning this machine, send mail to postmaster@sgi.sgi.com 
 or call (415) 390-3410.
============ 

Could some kind soul describe briefly how something like this can be 
setup ?

Thanks very much.
