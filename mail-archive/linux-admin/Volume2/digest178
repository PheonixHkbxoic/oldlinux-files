I have one of these and I called Teac yesterday on the subject (try their

Ugh!  This will cause trouble.

The correct solution for linux 1.1.x is to simply define the drive

Really don't know much about the Slackware 2.0 distribution.  I used 1.0 and
1.20 dist.  Based on your kernel version, i think you used slackware 1.0 dist.

Try this: /etc/hostname
put in hostname.domainname (e.g: diane.cs.virginia.edu)

In /etc/hosts
local_ipaddress   diane.cs.virginia.edu

I have encountered this problem and I hope someone can point out a fix

su and used "passwd foo" to change his password. That works fine for a
few days but then foo's password becomes no longer valid for some weird

foo's new password works, but the the root password no longer works.

As the admin of a machine that got broken into purely because CERT sat on 
the 8.6.8 sendmail bug and didn't tell the world I regard telling everyone

In theory you should be able to mount /usr as readonly (see Linux' FSSTND),
all writeable stuff of /usr should go in /var. You have 4 main candidates for
separate partitions:
* / except the ones mentioned below: this part is as small as possible since
  it is only used to boot and do FS repair (or something similar).
* /usr should/could be readonly.
* /var must be writable.
* /home

The benefit of several partitions is that:
* readonly FSs don't corrupt (well, they shouldn't); but when you (sysadmin)
  need to add software to /usr, you must remount the FS as writeable and
  afterwards as readonly again.
* a corrupt partition doesn't harm the other partitions.

The main disadvantage is that you need some planning on the sizes of the
partitions, it is laborous to do it afterwards (and you need lots of free
space either on disk or on floppies...).

   It's not a "virtual space" -- the machine is sitting there,
eating electricity and producing heat.  If you want to visit it,
it's simple courtesy to ask first, just as it's considered polite
to ask someone if you can visit their house.

Subject: BUPS-HOWTO warning
Date: 6 Oct 1994 18:38:15 GMT

If you want to connect the APC Back-UPS to your Linux box, this might
be of interest to you.

There is a good BUPS-HOWTO which describes how to do this. But it has
one "bug".

The RTS serial port signal is used to shut down the UPS. The UPS will
shut down only if it operates from its battery. The manual says that
the shutdown signal must be high for at least 0.5s. But few milliseconds
is enough, at least for my APC Back-UPS 600.

Using RTS to shut down the UPS can be dangerous, because the RTS goes
high when the serial device is opened. The backupsd program then turns
RTS off, but it is on (high) for a moment. This kills the power when
backupsd is first started and there is a power failure at this time.
This can happen for example when the UPS is shut down, unattended,
and the power comes back for a while.

Either start backupsd before mounting any filesystems for read-write,
or (better) use TX (pin 3) instead of RTS (pin 7) to shut down the
UPS (pin numbers are for 9-pin plug). Use ioctl(fd, TCSBRKP, 10);
to make TX high for one second, for example. Using TX should be safe.
Maybe I will post the diffs if time permits...

I disagree with almost every one of those statements.
 o A VLB IDE controller can provide excellent data transfer performance with
   a much lower command overhead than SCSI.
 o SCSI controllors do slow down the CPU, some more than others.  The 53c80
   on my sound card might look like an extreme example to you, but it's
   typical of the average SCSI controller.  It's a CPU hog.  Even bus-master
   controllers compete for bus bandwidth.
 o SCSI drives do cost considerably more.  The typical IDE drive advertised
   in our local paper is a 540M at $239.  The same drive hardware with a
   SCSI controller is $380.  The "sweet spot" for SCSI drivers is a 1.0G
   (1.2G unformatted) drive at $599.  A 1.0G IDE drive is $495.  [[ I know
   you've seen better prices, I'm using the Washington Post as a uniform
   source of local prices. ]]
 o SCSI controllers cost a lot more than IDE controllers.  A VLB super-I/O
   IDE controller is under $20.  An ISA or VLB SCSI controller, which comes
   without the 2S/1P/1G, costs $100-$400.
 o IDE is far more standardized and common.  I've read that over 90% of the
   drives sold are IDE.  And there's no worry about which commands are
   supported, cabling or termination.
 o IDE drives do have a limited "disconnect" ability.  Modern drives
   silently do read-ahead on the current track, and you can issue a
   "seek" (IDE command 0x7*, which immediately disconnects) to move the
   the heads to a new track.  The disconnect issue doesn't apply to writes,
   which are accepted immediately and buffered while the heads move into
   position.  It also doesn't affect the typical user with a single primary
   drive. 
 o Setting up a >528M IDE drive is still much less complicated than SCSI.

I personally think that the best hope for SCSI is the NCR '810 and AMD '974,
which put can put SCSI on a PCI motherboard for about $30.  That's only
$80-$100 by the time it gets to you or me.

Most users I've talked to these days want all the benifits of a Unix shell,

UUCP is cost effective, but doesnt give telnet and ftp, which is what 
they are all screaming for...
[ Of course theres that TCP/IP emulator called TERM...]

: there is *big* interest in things UNIX by alot of MS-DOS users out there.
: i suspect your users will rise to the "challenge", except for the chronic
: and terminal whiners (but you know who they are by now).  for those, run
: the old MSDOS BBS program inside a DOSemu session.  they deserve it. :)

: >UUCP.  [detroit area]

: there is probably a "detroit.general" newsgroup (or something similar).
: just post a message there asking for a UUCP link ... it's a start.
: UUCP links are fairly easy to negotiate.  for mine, I asked a guy "Can I
: have a UUCP feed?" and he said "Ok".
I just wish my UUCP provider would actually start sending the news feeds 
to my site like it's supposed too..
: >I have a lot of questions and if 
you've read up to the end of this : >message I appreciate it already.

: well, considering my tone, you probably don't appreciate it.  ["miserable
I apreciate it though :)
: running-dog Linux elitist scum!" you are probably muttering :-]  alot of the
: above looks like I am sneering at *you* in particular, but thats not the
: case.  i am laughing at the idea of a "BBS Program" for Linux, and am somewhat
: concerned at the prospect of an MSDOS front end (and all that it implies)
: on a Linux machine.  for Linux offers you and your users a real escape from
: the basic limitations of the MS-DOS remote-access model.

I, like you, am of the same mind...I intend to right a simple shell 
script for 'beginners' who are not used to linux; but they can switch to 
a standard shell like csh bash or zsh anytime they wish, and I suspect 
once they are used to the environment they will want to :^)

The fail I got on the line with bogomips was 'delay calibration failed'.
Not sure what it meant, but it did not give me any problems.
