   well, umsdos is the easiest to set up; i just got our consultant
   machine here up in about 1.5 hours, networking & everything ('cept
   sendmail's a pain, what happened to regular, small, smail???)

FIPS is also *very* easy to use. All you need to do is run a disk
defrager first to make sure all the stuff in your existing partition
is in the same physical location on the disk. Then simply tell FIPS
how large you *want* the existing partition to be instead of what it
currently is. After that simply go back in with fdisk and divide up
the newly freed portion of the disk however you want. The advantage of
using FIPS is that you can also set up you swap partion while you're
at it. with UMSDOS you will have to use a swap file instead of a swap
partition if you need swap space (which is very likely). Swap
partitions tend to be significantly faster than swap files.

As far as mail goes, I found just the opposite. smail was a pain in
the tail, and sendmail worked pretty much out of the box...but then
again, we're connected to a large LAN (class B ? - netmask is
255.255.0.0) with several Name servers and user ids authenticated via
NIS (/home is NFS mounted from a central machine, which runs as an NIS
server also). I could never get smail to handle our set up. The
sendmail binary I got from the slackware distribution did not have NIS
support compiled in, but managed to work (*slowly*). I obtained the
sources and had it compiled with NIS support, and it now works like a
champ!!

What do you mean by "reproduced without involving the modem"? Somehow you
have to generate the G3 data...

If you generate the G3 data by using "pbmtog3", and the result looks
"weird", either your pbmtog3 or your g3topbm is broken.

If that one looks OK, but G3 data received from the modem cannot be 
properly converted, then most likely your modem returns some not-quite-
correct G3 data.

Reply-To: Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk (Ted Harding)

Well, I have a working ftape. Mind you, the Linux is Slackware 2.0
kernel 1.0.8, and the ftape is 0.9.10.patched, so it's practically
pre-historic in the context of the present discussion. But it works.
Admittedly the documentation and the HOWTO left me uncertain where I
stood until I'd tried it (and in some respects still do), but at least
I have archived and restored many Mbytes of stuff.

I've been following this discussion with some interest, because this
seems to illustrate one of the sensitive points of Linux at the moment:
A new version of a package (and their ain't much smaller nor more special
than ftape) comes out; it requires a new kernel (or new versions of
the libraries), so if you want it (and especially if you don't have it
already) you end up upgrading on many fronts just for the sake of that
one bit.

It isn't possible. On sendmail is/was that daft. Sendmail 8.6.9 is now at

You might be intrested in the fact that when pppd is running for the
network device ppp0, the pid of pppd is stored in the file /var/run/ppp0.pid.

Likewise, ppp1's pid is in /var/run/ppp1.pid.

It may help clean up the mess dealing with awk scripts and ps.

Not at the present time. It is on the "gee, one of these days . . . ."
list.

I am of the opinion that the filtering should be done in a general
manner.  There should not be a filter put into the PPP driver as
such. It should go into the network layer. There is no reason that
SLIP should not be able to do filtering. There is no reason that a
frame received by the ethernet or token ring driver should not do
filtering.

A nice package is called 'screend'. It is listed in archie. I started
to compile it. There are some compile problems, however, none that can
not be solved by some careful attention. I just had to put the work on
hold to work on more pressing matters.

The problem with 'screend' is that it is not tied into the kernel as a
kernel procedure. The screend program runs in user level code. Each
frame received is passed through the user level code. This makes life
easier to test, but slower as it now needs to do a process dispatch
with every frame.

However, screend has an excellent filtering syntax. It is very nice.

A second filter was posted to the usenet source groups. (I don't
remember which one. It could have been alt.sources, comp.sources.misc,
or comp.sources.unix.) I saved it under the name 'ipfilter'. Perhaps
archie will also find it. (If not, let me know and I'll send it to
you. Please try to find it first.)

This is a better implementation. The user level code builds the
control tables which are loaded into the kernel. The kernel then maps
the addresses into the tables and does the go/no-go tests. Only the
failures are then reported to the user level code.

If you wish to do filtering, then either of these would be a good
place to start.

>Seems like packet filtering like this would have to be built into the
>kernel or pppd.  But I don't know.

Please think 'bigger picture' than just ppp. The actual filter itself
should be in the kernel. Use a ioctl or system call to load the
control table from a user process. Do filtering for all types of
devices.

(Don't forget that the networking software deals with frames other
than IP. There is IPX, etc. as well.)

Hi there,

Currently, I'm happily churning away, using [C]SLIP on my machine.  Recently,
someone told me that PPP is more efficient and much better than using
SLIP.  Is this true?  Does anyone have a rough idea or maybe even some
numbers showing which is better of the two to use?  If PPP is better,
where can I get the necessary software to run it?  Is it as trivial to
configure as SLIP was?  (With SLIP it was merely changing a sample
script slightly).

George,

It might be a long shot but here it is:

UnixWare has SMTP to MHS right out of the box. That way you can use
your favorite MHS mailer and still be able to mail to someone on the
Internet. If you, or your company, don't have UnixWare this solution
might be overkill.

UMSDOS is _much_ slower than e.g. ext2fs. I'd recommend FIPS. It is
not difficult to use and contains good documentation.

A little worried about noone reading your post?  Please try to confine your
Linux posts to ONE newsgroup.  Flooding the newsgroups like this is
contrary to the reason they were split in the first place (so people wouldn't
have to see EVERYTHING posted).

It is my understanding that the FC-10 card from Colorado will allow hardware
compression AND talk to the tape drive at 1Mbps.  Most standard floppy controllers
will only talk to the drive at 500Kbps.  Floppy controllers which support the
2.88MB 3.5" drives are capable of accessing your tape drive 1Mbps, so you can
gain a 2/1 performance boost with a better floppy controller.

If I am wrong here, I'm sure I will be corrected.  This is information I have
deduced from various places (newsgroups, ads, etc).

Here you are refering to the QIC-40 and  QIC-80 tape formats (as opposed
to the QIC-117 tape drive interface).  It is my understanding that if you
have the spec, you could write a user program to read/write QIC-40/80 tapes
(kinda like tar does).  No one has had the gumption to go do it yet.
Also given that I can back up my DOS drives from Linux using tar, I have
even less of a reason to use TAPE.EXE or CBLITE.EXE anymore, period.

There is supposed to be a tape formatting program in the works, but getting
the drives working at all is obviously the top priority of the QIC-117 team
(person?).

No, these programs are going to need some low level support to allow the
"DOS" devices to be re-directed properly to the Linux devices.  Most of it is
done down at the hardware level, and needs to be specially coded.  Since the
FTAPE support isn't really "offical" yet (its not integrated into a released
kernel), its not likely to happen any time soon.

I am mostly interested in network and modems,

Does anyone working on PCMCIA drivers for Linux?

=======

Second question is about S-VGA drivers, is there or will be a 'generic' 
one supported in 640x480x256? or/and the LINEAR chips set.?


This is for a AST Advantage! Explorer Notebook, I've (mostly) converted

decent video display, I'll have to keep Windog :-) around!
