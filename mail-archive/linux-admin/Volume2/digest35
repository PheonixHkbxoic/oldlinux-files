Hello,
I'm working with linux 1.1.49 and X11R5. After I have start
openwin I opened a cmdtool shell (console). I try to change
the userid with su and login. While I hacked the password
I don't believe my eyes. The password was on the screen. I
think this does'nt work fine.

Date: 7 Sep 1994 20:46:34 GMT

I have installed wu-ftp (thanks to those who provided help with patches),
everything is working except I have one strange problem:

Lets say there is a file called "test.dat" in the /pub/packages directory.
Lets assume I want to ftp into the linux box and get the test.dat file.

======================================
   If I do:

   ftp to the host and log in.....

   cd /pub/packages
   get test.dat

   Everything works great
======================================
   If I do:

   ftp to the host and log in...

   get /pub/packages/test.dat

   it fails with:

   /pub/packages/test.dat: No such file or directory
======================================
   If I do:

   ftp to the host and log in...

   get /pub/packages/test.dat test.dat

   This works OK.
======================================


Does anyone have any clue why the middle case above will not work ??

I had this same problem.  I had assumed it was something I had screwed up
on my system, and I forgot about it.  Apparently not.  At any rate, xarchie
version 2.0.9 works fine.  I got the un-modified sources from ftp.x.org and
have no problems.  I even linked it with libXaw3d, so it looks a little nicer.
If you're running X, this is a nice option.  Of course, it doesn't address
what's wrong with regular archie.  I'm running 1.1.49 with libc 4.5.26.

I didn't find it on sunsite.

Subject: Problems with dialing out with Minicom
Date: Wed,  7 Sep 94 12:22:45 GMT


I am running Linux 1.0 and have it all set up for uucp. I have a 
problem dialing out with Minicom. It used to be ok before.

When I select a number from my dialing directory, it starts the countdown
to dial the number but doesn't really dial. When I hit any key to
abort the dial, it THEN starts to dial !!!! However, now after dialing
the line just dies.

It's a bit flaky in the sense that I have had it behave normally on
two occassions after repeated attempts. Any help would be sincerely
appreciated. Direct e-mails are preferred if possible. 

Thanks in advance.

Regards,

Vikram.

Hi,

Can anybody help me on this one. I have a Laserjet 4M Plus on ethernet (mio) 
that bootp's from my linux box. Thats no problem but the laserjet manual 
states an option to TFTP additional info to the printer like SMNP info etc 
etc. Well that stuff is only available on Sun and HPUX platforms. I don't 
know if I need it but I'm having problems sending ASCII file to the printer. 
Postscript files are fine with the entry I made in the printcap file but 
ASCII files won't print. Looks like I have to implment some kind of filter 
but I've got no idea how to do that. Anybody who can help me ???

Thanks in advance.

I guess cnews has been improved since I dealt
with it, but I inherited a cnews system that
was extremely confusing.  After a few awful
months, which finished with it dying completely,
I replaced the whole mess with INN, and for the
last 18 months or so, it's been wonderful - I 
seldom have to do anything with it.  It also 
gives pretty useful diagnostics so that debugging
problems isn't very hard, and the tutorials for
setting it up and verifying its operation are
also quite nice.

In regard to this, there's someplace in the various
INN documentation that shows you how to log into
your server's nntp port and find out if you're 
authorized and then shows you how to present a
fake article to see if it works.  The first is 
done by "telnet yourserver 119" and then typing 
"IHAVE".  If you don't have permission, it tells
you "permission denied".  You then have to change
the nnrp.access file to allow that machine.

This posting has 2 sections. The first half contains the BOF descriptions,
while the second shows times and meeting room sizes.

---part 1: descriptions---
LISA VIII BOFs

From the conference flier:

BIRDS-OF-A-FEATHER SESSIONS
***************************
Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions (BOFs) allow attendees to meet and discuss
topics of interest to them.  BOF Sessions are intended to be highly
interactive and much less formal than the Technical Sessions.
Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions will be held Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings in the Town and Country Hotel.  We would particularly
like to encourage Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions on topics which would not
normally be discussed during typical USENIX technical presentations
(for instance, discussions on professional and technical issues,
non-professional interests common to Systems Administrators, etc.)  To
schedule a BOF Session, or to request more information, direct your
e-mail to Lee Damon, nomad@network.ucsd.edu.  BOFs may also be
scheduled on-site at the Conference Registration Desk.

To schedule a BOF, contact me at nomad@network.ucsd.edu. I'll need to
know about how many people you expect, how long it will take, and which
night/time you want.

See you in San Diego!

---

We have between 7 and 9 rooms a night. A BOF can be booked in half-hour
increments from half an hour to 2 hours (or more, if really needed).
Tuesday & Wednesday we will start at 6:30pm and Thursday we start at
8:30 (to give people time to get dinner or back from the reception).

Here's the list of what's scheduled so far.

Tuesday  18:30 - 22:30
18:30 - 20:30
              WWW Installation, Maintenance, Administration,
              and assorted Topics
                Amy K. Kreiling, Univ. North Carolina, kreiling@cs.unc.edu
    Open discussion of issues having to do with the installation,
    configuration & management of a WWW server.  Come and share
    your experiences as the Web Master at your site.  We may even
    decide who should be declared the "WebMaster of the Universe" --
    criteria to be determined later.

18:30 - 20:30
        
                 Auspex User's
            Heather Staples, hstaples@auspex.com
        This BOF is aimed at users/administrators of Auspex NFS servers, and
        others who are interested in these systems.  Auspex servers and the
        special problems of managing these large NFS installations will be
        discussed.  Auspex technical personnel will attend the session to
        answer questions and address problems.  A list of topics/questions
        will be prepared in advance and distributed at the BOF to get things
        going, but other items of interest can be brought up during the
        session. 

19:30 - 20:30
             World Cup Computing
               Wayne Fowers, wayne@compute.com
    A programmatic technology was used to administer the very large network
    of approximately 1200 Sun servers and clients which supported all
    aspects of the games.  These systems were spread over nine venues
    across the U.S.  This technology provided efficient deployment of
    software on those systems under very stringent time constraints.  This
    session discusses the programmatic technology, which can provide a
    several fold increase in systems administrator productivity through
    it's use.


19:30 - 22:30
                 Tools for Sysadmin Tasks
                Jon Finke, finkej@rpi.edu
             John Simpson johns@minnie.nic.kingston.ibm.com
    Automating and Mechanizing User Administration Tasks is
    concentrating on the problems of managing large numbers of users
    while Tools for System Administration Tasks is concentrating on the
    problems of managing large numbers of systems. The BOF is split in
    two parts:

    19:30 - 21:00 Automating and Mechanizing User Administration
    Tasks.

    Many of the tasks of the system administrator can benefit from
    automation and programming.  In many areas vendors are providing
    tools to assist with that. The problem is, many of these tools
    don't scale up well.  They may be fine for adding a few users a
    day, or managing a small cluster of machines, but don't cut it when
    you have to create userids for 2000 new students  Some tools for
    managing large numbers of systems exist (rdist, package(AFS)), but
    tools for managing large numbers of users seem to be few and far
    between.  We have found that using a relational database has made
    it much easier to solve many of these problems.  What have people
    been doing to address this problem? What problems have you
    encountered?  How do you get University Administrators to
    cooperate?  What can you give them in return?

    21:00 - 22:30 Tools for System Administration Tasks

    There are many "Publicly Available" tools which are widely used by
    system administrators. If these tools were identified in an orderly
    fashion software vendors could integrate them as part of their
    product offerings. This would save the system administrators
    research, retreival, and possibly configuration of these tools. We
    have identified Amd, NTP, SUP, Tcl, Tk, Expect and Perl as useful
    tools for managing systems. What tools have system administators
    been using? What are the requirements that we should place on
    selecting tools (heterogenous, ease of install/configuration,
    etc.)? How is the quality of the tools that you use?


20:30 - 22:30
                Women in Systems Administration
                Vicki Brown, vicki@thor.srl.caltech.edu
    Join fellow female sysadmins in a not-that-formal gathering where
    we talk about the "issues" that face us, such as:  Is systems
    administration a "pink collar ghetto"?  How do/should we interact
    with phone reps to get things done quickly without having to prove
    ourselves?  How do/should we interact with male supervisors,
    coworkers, and users:  positions where we are alternately the
    subjects, peers, and superiors of men?  Is there a "best" style to
    dressing that is inconspicuous, comfortable, and not compromising,
    or does it depend on a woman's personal style and environment (or
    day of the week!)?  Are there any "issues" at all, or is everything
    gender-neutral?  Bring your heated opinions, friendly advice, and
    juicy gossip, and meet some great people as the week begins.  All
    interested persons welcome.

Wednesday  18:30 - 22:30
18:30 - 19:30
              reserved for a secret fun thing :)

              SAGE Working Groups
                Lee Damon, Castle P.A.U.S., nomad@castle.org
    Members of the various Working Groups will have a chance
    to meet and work together on their WG topic.

              Majordomo
                John P. Rouillard, UMB, rouilj@cs.umb.edu
    The majordomo mailing list manager has undergone some major changes
    over the past year. In the next year most of the internals of
    majordomo are going to be rewritten, and soon new modules of
    functionality will be added to majordomo. In addition the current code
    will become a testing bed for the new control mechanisms and the base
    features we will see in future majordomos. Come and join us when we
    discuss the fate of majordomo's current and future. Any quips,
    comments, evasions, questions or answers?

20:30 - 22:30
                Silicon Graphics Administration
                 John E. Schimmel, jes@sgi.com
 
    Have problems with Irix or any of your SGI hardware that has not
    been answered on comp.sys.sgi.admin?  Want to know about what is
    happening inside of SGI?  Feel like letting SGI engineers know what
    you want to see in the next generation of products?  Just want to
    come by and rumormonger?  Well that's what this BOF is all about.
    A few nice people from SGI will show up to try to deal with what
    comes along.  Please bring suggestions for future SGI
    administration products.

19:30 - 21:30
               Sun Managers 
                John DiMarco, jdd@cdf.toronto.edu
    Open discussions about managing Sun Systems.  All aspects of Sun
    systems are fair game: SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x, hardware, and
    software.  All Sun Managers welcome.  Bring your problems; somebody
    else may already have solutions for them.  Upgrading to Solaris or
    thinking about it?  Pick the brains of those who've already done
    it.  Done anything interesting lately with your Suns?  Tell us all
    about it.  Or just drop by to gab, gripe, wish aloud, shoot the
    breeze and swap rumours.

        The topic is automounting, if you are an automounter,
        autofs, or Amd administrator, this should interest you.
        Brent Callaghan will lead off with a short presentation
        on autofs developments and futures, followed by a general
        discussion on automounting problems and configurations.

                Brent Chapman, Great Circle, brent@greatcircle.com
    The Firewalls BOF will be a forum to discuss issues related to
    constructing and maintaining Internet firewall security systems.  An
    "Internet firewall" could be defined as any system that lets a site
    access selected services of the Internet, while shielding that site
    against unauthorized access from the Internet.  Current firewall
    technologies include packet filtering and application-level gateways.
    Brent Chapman manages the Internet "Firewalls" mailing list.

Hi,

I now have my system setup to where I am happy and I need to backup
the entire system. I found some nice handy dandy backup scripts on
tsx-11, but I am at a loss to set up a search and rescue diskette. I
am using ftape and Linux 1.1.40.

At this point, I am open to suggestions of popular backup scripts with
built-in SAR generation.

Thanks for suggestions,
Bruce
