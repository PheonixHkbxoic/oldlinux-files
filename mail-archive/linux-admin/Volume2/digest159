You have them inverted. The 'g' protocol is the original uucp protocol. 'G'
is a slightly modified incarnation.

The 'g' protocol specification is NOT limited to 64 byte packets. A modern
implementation, e.g., Taylor, supports 512, 1024, etc. Some poorly written
uucp packages may not support packets > 64.

If one is running Taylor UUCP, the packet sizes and number of windows are
both configurable.

While we're talking of security holes, here's another one that
has been around for some time.  The cause of the problem is the
same as above, I suppose.  In some smail binaries, you can create
files in arbitrary directories by putting file names like
/etc/foobar in your .forward file.  This is because of the
peculiar way in which smail does its permission checking.

When compiled with the HAVE_SETREUID option, smail drops
root privilege while delivering to a file. When compiled
without this option, as a number of smail binaries have been,
the approach is somewhat more crude. By default, smail
checks only if the file exists and is writable by the user
that requested delivery.  If the file doesn't exist, it is
created right away.

This behavior can be `improved' by adding the `check_path'
attribute to the file transport defintion in
/usr/lib/smail/transports.  Incidentally, this flag is
turned off by default.

I do this all the time on my Linux box.  The procedure that I use is as follows:

1.  Write the settings that you wish to use for people logging in into the
modem's NV-RAM (i.e. set up the modem and type AT&W)

2.  Set up the init string in your communications package to set the 
correct values when you are dialing out.

I know that minicom resets the modem from the NVRAM after you lexit it,
and would assume that others do as well.  If not, you can simply type
ATZ before you exit.

Hope this helps!!!

There appears to be a bug in the latest v3.0 PC/TCP Telnet (Windows

with the Windows telnet acting oddly with Informix 4GL screens and
with the DOS telnet some of the line drawing stuff is not working
right.  I know the problem is not in the Unix side because use of
other client telnets work/display correctly.  

I'm in the process of dealing with FTP support to resolve the
problem, you should probably also contact FTP support.

Boy, one thing I sure missed.  The aha1542 driver is used for what you
are trying to do.  The driver only appeats to support port addresses
0x330 and 0x340.  That is likely why it is not working.  You will have
to change your 1542's address.

Hi everyone,

many thanks for all of you who replied by eMail or in this group. Meanwhile,
after some more excessive testing, I'm up and running with the two above!!!

The clue was the "dial"-command. Richard J Wyble <rwyble@iii.net> wrote to
me, that

I did the last one changing the dial-command into
send ATDT1613075\r

and it connected!

Another error was waiting for the wrong prompt afterwards. I recovered this one
by using the "debug" mode. It can be involved through

echo on

in the script file. After this, all output from the modem is echoed.

Once again, many thanks,

Cheers, Dirk

You can do dial on demand now, with pty's and a bit of user mode code
hacking. Just nobody has written it.

I consider the way SCO handles it to be totally broken - there are ways to
handle modems without the need to change the modem settings every time
(which will invariably lead to a modem with wrong settings one day...).

Take a look at "mgetty+sendfax"; the getty in that package knows about
modems and handles RING and CONNECT very well, so no need to change modem
settings. When dialing out, mgetty sees the uucp Lock file, and gives away
the modem line (so cu, uucico, ... can use it without any interference
from the getty), exactly as SCO's uugetty does it.

mgetty can be found on all sunsite.unc.edu mirrors in
/pub/Linux/system/Serial/mgetty+sendfax-0.21.tar.gz

The ICS2595 support has a few problems.  The following is added to
that entry in the current version of README.S3:

                        Clockchip support is only preliminary and
                        on some machines problems with the first

                        switching to next mode with CTRL+ALT+'+'
                        and back seems to solve this problem

Note: the latest versions of README files can be found in the doc/ directory
on most XFree86 3.1 ftp sites.
