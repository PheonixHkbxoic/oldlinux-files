Date: 03 Oct 1994 19:01:17 GMT

I'm setting up a Linux system and would like some recommendations
about partitioning.  I plan to run with a X and a network in the future.

1. Is it necessary to have both root and usr partition?

2. What's the necessary size for a root partition.


Currently I'm planning a layout something like this:

Root: 35meg
Swap: 16meg
Usr: (the rest of the disk)

A more likely cause of this trouble is that the root filesystem is getting
mounted read/write by default at boot time, as if so it will always be checked.
Add a line with "read-only" to the Lilo config for your linux system, or check
the docs. for whatever method you use for booting. Adding FSCK to the boot 
options is a simple matter of inserting the command into /etc/rc.local or
/etc/rc.d/rc.S, depending on your Linux setup ( put it in the one that exists

Hope this also helps.

I'm not a Mac expert, but the ones I've used car read and write MSDOS disks.
The disk icon looks like a floppy with PC written on it in large letters.
Perhaps your solution is to use an IBM-formatted floppy, and then mount it
on you r linux box with the -t msdos flag.

Yes, we have the problem too. I am running a 4 line SLIP dial-in Internet 
Service. Original Slackware 1.2 installation, now with kernel 1.1.50.
The problem is only with services accessed through *inetd*, and in our case 
especially seems to occur when more than about 10 sockets are open, mostly 
with incoming SMTP traffic.  Any attempt to get into the server with SMTP, 
POP3 and TELNET (others maybe too) will simply 'hang' for a very long time, 
after which it suddenly releases itself.  The problem is, that many users 
simply hang-up in this situation, and re-dial in again. This causes a flood of 
open sockets, which stay open for very long times, making the system 
inaccesible.  Because most of our trafic is SMTP, I am considering running the 
SMTPd daemon sepparate from inetd. Maybe this will overcome the situation in 
our case. I hope that somebody with knowlage can look intoi this situation!

A friend of mine has installed Linux V.1.0.9. 
His problem appears while starting Xfig. On loading the program the whole
Main Memory is allocated for the needs of swapping until the lower bound of
80 K is reached, without starting Xfig. The Failure Message : "Font Type
... not found" is being displayed and because of the lack of memory space
the Xserver shuts down with error message.

Does anyone have an idea why this can happen and how this phenomen can be
prevented?

  Hmm, thanks for that. Just one thing we have another problem on a
machine I help to run. Telnet sessions from PC's don't freeze as far
as I know, but they do cause telnet OUT of the Linux box and things
like TUsh and TinyFugue to act weirdly, as in telnets out display 8
bit chars and beep all over the place, and TUsh/TinyFugue SEGV on
startup, this doesn't happen when telnetting in from a unix box...
  Anyone got any ideas? I've tried all combinations of PC/TCP
compatibility, IPX and dummy net driver in the kernel and it doesnn't
make a difference...

Hi guys !
We have a very heterogeneous network with the Operating Systems :
Solaris, Sun-Os, Os2, DOS/WINDOWS, MAC-OS, CLIX,OS 400, IRIX, AIX, HP-UX,
sco-xenix, linux, ... 
Linux can easy be used as a print server for most of the OS's .
Most of the unix/os2 systems print to the linux-box using lpr (berkley printing
 system), and the dos/windows systems print files whith pcnfs own printing mechanism .
It would be very nice if I can find an implementation of the system-V print spooling
for linux, because there are some unix systems which only have a system-V style print spooling implemented!
Any information is appreciated !
Thanks in advance !

Subject: Yggdrasil & large SCSI disk???
Date: Tue, 04 Oct 94 08:28:07 PDT


By now I have read everything I could find about running Linux on large disks, but 
none of the many files/messages really seems to help in my case. They all seem to
assume that the real disk configuration is known beforehand or can be easily inferred
from the 'fake' disk configuration. 

My 1 GB SCSI disk (FUJITSU) pretends to have 1020 cylinders, 34 heads and 61 sectors
per head. I don't believe that this is the real configuration, but I cannot find
any hints anywhere of what the disk really might look like. And 34 (heads does not
seem to be an easy multiple of any number below the standard 16 (heads).

The Summer 94 Yggdrasil CD-ROM (with the Rev. B boot diskette to get NCR 83C810
support) starts the install. I can do the fdisk to establish the Linux partitions,
do the 'mkfs' routine for all partions, etc., but then it can suddenly not find 
'/dev/sda3' anymore.  Apparently, that's the point in time where it switches to
the 'real' disk geometry and gets lost. The result is "Could not mount the root
file system /dev/sda3. Giving up."

Any help?

It's an incompatibility between the current Cisco stuff and Linux. The Cisco
stuff doesn't do its windowing right in some cases (legally but not 'right')
as it were. This causes Linux to wait for a larger window which doesn't
occur. Linux then doesnt send as much as it can fit anyway which causes it
all to hang (so its a cisco oddity but a Linux BUG). I've started trying to
sort it out now - I suspect its going to add a good six weeks of shaking
down TCP changes before 1.2.0 will be ready if it goes in for 1.2.0 though.

Workaround:

Use a current kernel & net tools

        route add ip.of.cisco.router mss 576

I've had ftape working with every kernel since 0.98 or so.  At about
1.1.20, I had to upgrade modutils.  At about 1.1.45, I had to apply
ftape-irq-dma.patch, except for its change in the request_dma() line,
which isn't needed until 1.1.50.  When I bought Conner's new (broken)
DOS tape formatting software, I had to create ftape-conner.patch so it
would work, but only for that reason.

I posted ftape-irq-dma.patch to work with the latest kernel because
I thought it would *reduce* the number of complaints.  It has-- I 
see lots of people who say they've applied it to get ftape working.
