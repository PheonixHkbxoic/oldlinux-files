I've been trying to install sudo.v1.3 under AIX 3.2.5, and come up with the
externals: 

__crypt
__encrypt
__setkey

unresolved from the link. These appear to be lower level routines called
out of the crypt entry in /lib/libc.a/shr.o

None of the guru's around here seem to have an answer beyond vague mutterings
that it has something to do with the non-exportability of des encryption...
Is this right? If so I'm surprised it wasn't mentioned in the install docs
and wonder if instead there's just another library someplace that needs to
be pulled in to resolve these...

Since Todd's off on a "much needed vacation" until later this month and
I'm kinda pressed for time pending a "much unneeded business trip", I
hoped somebody might know the answer to this one...

This is wrong.  Tar writes blocks of 20 x 512 bytes (unless you override
it with options), but it does not pad files to 20 x 512 byte blocks.  It
pads files only to 512 byte blocks.  The maximum, that you loose on one
file in an tar archive thus is 511 byte and another 512 byte for the header
block.

However, the archive as a whole is padded to 20x512 byte blocks.  So the
uncompressed size of tar files is always a multiple of 10240 bytes.

Several people have reported success by linking /bin/mail to elm.  If
elm is called from a pipe, not from a terminal, it pretty much behaves
like mail.

Linux is not GNU.  Any Linux developper is free to port the code to
Apple's computer.  It is only, that the FSF won't do it.

PowerPC is not Apple.  PowerPC is a chip desigened by a few major
companies, like IBM and Motorola.

There is indeed a project to port Linux to the Power PC.  Latest time I
heard about it, it was still very ALPHA.  See the PROJECTS FAQ, which
is posted to comp.os.linux.announce regularly.

You have to make them yourself.  cd to the source/newconf directory, and
type make; make install.

Go check out "Crack" and "CrackLib".

- the former is a retroactive password cracker, and the latter is a
library routine that can be wired into "passwd" type programs, so that
a user's attempts to select a new password may proactively screened for

Hi Steve,
Did you try booting from the boot disk without saying 'mount ...' ?
Just hit enter at the first prompt in such a way to have the color disk

I am afraid that what you have done is that you deleted your linux partitions.
DOS disk DOESN'T recognise any non-dos 'partition' inside a 'extended partition', which it itself calls 'extended DOS partition'.
Modifying logical drives inside a extended partition with DOS fdisk leads to the
deletion of all non-dos 'partitions' inside.
The only chance to recover applies only if you have a printout of linux fdisk of
the original partitioning, including start and end cylinders of all partitions.
The you can repartition the drive from a linux boot floppy with linux fdisk by using exactly the same values.
Otherwise I am afraid your data are lost. I would be sorry for that.

I have Linuz running 1.0.8 just fine, slackware 1.2 install, fine and
dandy.  But I wanted to test the 1.1.45 Kernel, so I compiled and
ran into a snag on re-boot.  So I decided to reboot from SLACKWARE
1.2 with the boot command:

mount root=/dev/hda1

and it seemed to go okay, it asked for the ROOT disk and read some,
the locked up after the 'root mounted' message.  This was with the
SCSINET boot image, which worked okay for the original install and
current hardware of IDE disk (330 Meg) and 3c579 NIC.  

I tried to boot with slackware 2.0 SCSINET and NET boot images, using
both the COLOR and TTY disks (I have 1.44 floppies) but it hangs at the
same place again.

Any ideas?

Thanks so very very much!  

Steve...

P.S.  Once I get in I have the old kernel to tell LILO to boot from
so I'll be fine :)

You will have ot change the permissions for the files or directory you are 
accessing via NFS by using chmod.

          usr               group          world
         r  w  x            r  w  x          r  w  x
         |   |   |             |   |   |           |   |   |
         |   |   |             |   |   |           |   |   |
400--    |   |             |   |   |           |   |   |
200 -----    |             |   |   |           |   |   |

One rather cheap way is to to something like
tredir 2023 23
(you need not be root to do that)
Anyone wanting a remote login can then say
telnet your.machine 2023
