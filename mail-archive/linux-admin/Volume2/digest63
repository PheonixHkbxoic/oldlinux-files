I dont think you need to do that as linux's libc already has UFC as its
encrypter/decrypter.

Without actually ever seeing the package concerned I suggest you can add
to the CFLAGS line in your Makefile

        CFLAGS=-D_crypt=crypt -D_encrypt=encrypt -D_setkey=setkey

and then recompile.

Subject: Screen locks on X shutdown!
Date: 14 Sep 1994 12:17:25 GMT

Hi Everybody!  Please help.  I entered this plea in mid August but had
no responses from anyone.  Getting desparate!  

On exit from our logout X window the screen locks up: we get 2 horizontal
black lines and a lot of vertical blue ones plus much flickering on the 
screen.  We can't get to any of the other VCs, and must re-boot.  Prior
to exit, everything looks and runs normally in X.

We're using an AST SVGA-NI monitor and AST Bravo MT 4/66d with Linux 1.09 
and the XFree86 ver 2.1   The Xconfig file we're using is very close to 
the Xconfig.23 from the sample directory.  SuperProbe says the chipset is
ATI 68800-6 with attached coprocessor ATI Mach-32 and 1Kb video memory.

We have captured the error message which is as follows:

========================================================================
Waiting for X server to shut down XIO:  fatal IO error 2 (broken pipe) on
X server ":0.0"
           after 471 requests (471 known processed) with 0 events remaining
.........

xinit:  X server slow to shut down, sending KILL signal.

waiting for server to die

xinit:  Unknown error (errno 0):  Client error.
========================================================================

Does anyone have an inkling of what the problem might be?  Some jumpers not
set properly somewhere?  The AST Bravo has the video stuff integrated into
the motherboard.  Has anyone successfully used X under Linux with an AST
Bravo pc?

Thanks very very much for your help.

Subject: User nobody?
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 1994 04:27:01 GMT

I've just installed all my network stuff, and some of the config files
expected for the user nobody to exist.  So I tried adding a user
nobody with uid equal to -2.  But it got put into /etc/passwd as uid
65534.  I can see where that came from.  I changed it manually to -2,
and it worked ok.  However, when I then added another (real) user, his
uid got set to 65535 (i.e., -1).  Is this the expected behavior, and
if so, what uid should I set nobody to if I don't want this to happen?

Thanks,

/dev/hda2 is a partition, not a drive. Type
fdisk /dev/hda
and you will be able to partition your first IDE drive.  If you
want to partitiona second IDe drive type
fdisk /dev/hdb

Subject: HYDRA - serial bidirectional transfer for Linux?
Date: 14 Sep 1994 13:11:58 GMT


Guten Tag!

   Did anybody consider porting HYDRA, a serial bidirectional file transfer
program to Linux?

   HYDRA is a file transfer protocol available for MS-DOS and Amiga machines
which allows sending and receiving files from/to serial connections at the
same time. On a 19200 connection it is said to manage >2200cps for sending
or receiving - resulting in >4400cps considering the bidirectional transfer.

   The good thing is that the source code of this program is available.
At least the documentation says so. Unfortunately, I did not find the source
code on the net.

   So: Is any port for Linux available? If not where can I get the source
code so that I can have a try on it myself?

   Any information will be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

That sounds like a termcap entry problem... I don't have it, and I'm using
a different distribution.  The console vt100 emulation -- an attribute of
the _kernel_ -- supports IL and DL directly, even correctly interacting
with the scrolling region.  Check other termcaps, and if you're equipped,
take a look at the console.c in your kernel source tree to see what it
expects.  This is an area that deserves better documentation.  The
authoritative source for the emulation ought not to be the termcap file.

Cheers,

Hi all!

FYI, the newer fvwms have init & restart functions in the system.fvwmrc
file that can do this also, the latest one just came out last week and
has a lot more modules. I use GREAT w/fvwm and the possibilities are
endless . . . .

I did a complete analysis of DOOM last night; below are my results.
Note I have a Gateway 2000 486/66 16M ram, with ATI Ultra Pro & 2MB
VRAM, 17" CrystalScan 1776 monitor, and PAS-16 sound card.

For Linux I'm running kernel 1.0.9 (Slackware 2.0), XFree86 2.1.1 in
1150x910, with voxware 2.90.2 installed, with both PAS and SB drivers.

For DOS I had both effects and music on; probably I should have turned
off the music to get a fairer reading, since Linux doesn't support
music, but that's how I play it so...

Note that you should probably specify which demo you ran the FPS test
against; as you can see below it makes a big difference in the frame
rate:

Subject: [Q] How maintain "console" entry in utmp file??
Date: 12 Sep 1994 23:58:29 -0400

   I don't know if this question has been brought up before or not...I
would think it has...

   I wrote a small program to place "console" logins (from XDM) into
the utmp, wtmp, and lastlog files.
   However, at random times, some program eats the utmp entry. I think
it's getty, but I'm not sure. (I run getty so my roomate can log in on
ttyS1).
   This is on Linux 1.1.x, with XFree86.

   Right now, "w" says this:

 11:55pm  up  5:48,  4 users,  load average: 0.47, 0.13, 0.18
User     tty      from             login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what
awk      ttyp0    :0.0            11:55pm            1         w
awk      ttyp1    :0.0            11:16pm            4         telnet vnet.net
sbolish  ttyS1                     8:19pm            1         pine
awk      console                   9:33pm  2:22                -

   After my roommate logs out, the "console" line disappears. Can
anybody give some pointers? I can most likely fix the problem if I
knew what program is doing this.

   Somebody must have this functionality working on there Linux X
box...

   Thanks....

Just for the record, *never* run mkswap on *any* partition containing
data that you want to keep. This should be emphasized in the
documentation that came with your Linux distribution. I'm using the MCC
distribution, and running fdisk and mkswap was explained there in a most
adequate manner.

Depends. Using Linux fdisk should work as well.

No, it'll just overwrite the master boot record (the very first block of
your hard disk). This will remove LILO if it's been installed there.
