I was wondering if there was anyway to have term 2.1.4 pass hostnames of
remote users.  I saw this for an earlier version of term but I donn't want to
have to use that older version.  




Thanks in advance

Fraid I can't agree. I see what you're saying and, to a degree, I can
sympathise. However, if you own "it" (whatever "it" might be), then you
have a right to say how it's disposed. The analogy I'd use is the backyard
swimming pool. All the neighbours and passers by drop in to use it.
One day you notice turds floating in it. You call a pool service. No
idea who's done it, except you're fairly sure it was one of those
free-loading bastards you let in. No matter how many times you drop the hint
that what's being done isn't appreciated, it carries on. You tell your
friend down the road. Eventually, the pair of you think "Fuck that! put
up a barbed wire fence, electrify it, Declare it No Entry and torch the
twats."

Subject: Symbolic Link Problems
Date: 15 Oct 1994 16:12:44 GMT

I'm running Linux 1.1.45 on a lab of computers.  They all share a passwd file
that is sym-linked to the server's.  The host file is also sym-linked along 
with a few others.  THe problem is that sometimes, adding an entry to the
hosts file with cat >>hosts on the server or when they change passwords on
the workstations, sometimes, the sym-links are destroyed and complete
files are written over them, eliminating the ability to make further changes
and I have to telnet to every computer, delete the hosts/passwd, and
re-establish the link (sometimes with disasterous consequences if done 
incorrectly).  Any ideas?  Is this fixed in new kernels?  E-mail to:

I starting playing with Linux again recently and opted to use
the UMSDOS file system because it was going to make my life
much easier than backing up and re-partitioning my hard disk.
The docs say that UMSDOS is a slower file system than the
other options, but is it really much slower? It seems pretty
quick to me (especially after working with MSDOS). I have
kernal 1.0.something (going to upgrade soon).
Is it really worth my time to backup and repartition?

I find the easiest way is to use the slackware boot/root disk installation 
disks. The setup program allows you to create a boot disk quite easily by 
installing LILO on the floppy, which can boot the image on the second drive.
The only problem I had with booting off of a second HD (IDE though) was that
fsck tried to check /dev/hda1 anyway. Easily solved by changing the fsck
command in the relevant rc file (/etc/rc.d/rc.S I think) to just check the
necessary drives.

I use 1.1.52 now and have great problems with floppies. When I try to mount
ext2 floppy I receive message like

        floppy: I/O error ????/????

With MS-DOS floppies I receive something about bad FAT entry.

It seems that floppy works properly only just after low level formatting.
May be it's something around disk-change?

The only save way for using floppies for me is to reboot with 1.1.45 where
there is all right.

It will if you add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

( cd /tmp ; rm -rf * )

Since I'm not the admin for your machine, it would be presumptuous of 
me to clear out your /tmp automatically.  What if you'd put something 
important in /tmp and didn't know Slackware was going to wipe it out on 
your next reboot?  Policies like the wiping of /tmp are best determined 
locally.  (That way, someone can be blamed locally ;^)

>Also, it seems like /usr/tmp is not used.

/usr/tmp in Slackware is a symbolic link to /var/tmp, and you're 
correct.  Not much of anything in Slackware does use /var/tmp.

It's possible that programs ported from other platforms could require it, 
though, so I think it's a good idea to have it.

Reply-To: pb@apd.dec.com (Peter Brouwer)

I have a simple configuration. A local lan with a few machines. I use a local
name server, with no resolving to the outside world.
All local machines relay E-mail to the mail exchanger machine if the address
contains a not resolved hostname. This works okee ( example from the README
file of the sendmail source distribution ).
The mail exchanger machine has a uucp connection to a machine with internet
connection. (  named internetrelay in the config file )
I see sendmail trying to resolve all hostname address instead of only the local
addresses.
Using sendmail -bt as test I see after the resolving timeouts that the mail
gets routed to the smart internet host.

When sending E-mail it does not start uucp to deliver the mail. In stead of
this I see a unresolved error when using mailq.

The problem is probably the name server lookup for not local addresses.
I do I stop sendmail from doing this.

Could you please E-mail me any suggestion. I will post a summary.

Did you check your /etc/passwd file.  The name of whoever with password must

Unfortunately Dell no longer uses these.  When I was selling Dells I

they cost $5 per machine and $5x100,000=too much money.  All of our

That's an interesting spin you have chosen to put on things.
Yes, it's true we do not plan to update 1.2.x, but you left out why:

Motif 2.0 is out.  We are working on porting Motif 2.0 to Linux.

In the meantime, allow me to explain how to make our Linux Motif work
with XFree86-3.1.
Yes, Virginia, Motif 1.2.x does work with X11R6, but we have
to rely on the magic of shared libraries and dynamic linking.


The short answer:

Install the libX11 and libXt of XFree86-2.1, and Motif will work.
(Also be sure /usr/X386/lib is in your /etc/ld.so.conf, and run ldconfig.)
The filename is XF86-2.1-lib.tar.gz, and it is available from
your friendly neighborhood Linux archive.  Use archie to find one near you.


The long answer:

Motif applications compiled with 1.2.4 WILL WORK with XFree86-3.1 (X11R6).
However, Motif 1.2.4 is based on X11R5, and it depends on
R5's libX11 and libXt.  So all you need to do is keep those libraries
(libX11 and libXt) from XFree86-2.1 installed on your system.
Through the magic of dynamic linking, the proper libraries will be
linked in.

I agree it would be nice if Motif would work seamlessly with R6,
but this is the way things are:

  XFree86-2.1 is based on X11R5.
  XFree86-3.1 is based on X11R6.
          X11R5 != X11R6
Motif 1.2.4 is      based on X11R5.
Motif 2.0   is      based on X11R5.
Motif 2.1   will be based on X11R6. (?)

Linux's shared dynamic linker (ld.so) provides a [IMHO solution] work-around,
and in fact the whole concept of major versions of shared libraries
was designed exactly for a situation like this.


>As I have no plan to keep old libraries taking the disk-space, I removed

This sounds to me like cutting off your nose to spite your face.
Let's see how much space the old libraries actually take up:

/usr/X386/lib/libX11.sa         157756
/usr/X386/lib/libXt.sa           80440
/usr/X386/lib/libX11.so.3.1.0   320516
/usr/X386/lib/libXt.so.3.1.0    291844

For a total of 850556 bytes.  Plus a couple of symbolic links
that ldconfig(8) will make.  I don't know...that doesn't seem like
a whole lot of space to me, but disk space is a scarce resource,
and everyone has to set his own priorities.

Bottom line is that we support our customers, and we are working on
providing the latest technology both in X and Motif.
Pay no attention to the boilerplate:  I am speaking for Metro Link this time.
