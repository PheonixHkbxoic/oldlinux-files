[article deleted for brevity]

I wonder if Insignia Solutions will be (does?) distribute a version
of their software for SCO or SVR4.  If so, you might be able to run
their emulator under iBCS on Linux and then run your Windows apps.

An emulator running an emulator could be pretty darn slow though!

Subject: Linux and Free BSD

I'd appreciate it if anyone with experience of Free BSD (and Linux) could email
me some (brief-ish) comparative notes. I'm particularly interested in the
"unixness" of the two systems, as well as ease of use/installation, conformity
to standards and the areas in which each shines. Is BSD more suitable for some
purposes, Linux for others. Is a BSD or a Linux based system more acceptable
in a commercial environment? Are either of them (yet)? Perhaps comments about
commercial packages too, where relevant. 

I'm asking for mail to avoid supplying flamebait; my aims are serious --
research for an article on Linux.

I did that! I followed the procedure in /usr/src/linux/README to the letter
and it didn't work. There must have been something in there from before
(my previous version was 1.1.23) that didn't get tidied up properly. In the
end I just emptied /usr/src/linux and started again. It worked find then.

        I got a lot of answers like this, but the problem is NOT on
local modem users, it is on users telnet'd rlogin'd into the machine.  
The kernel? not killing their processes when the user is disconnected.
It's pretty easy to simulate with fspclient.
fsp
'connect to a site'
get filename
^z
bg
exit

        FSP will continue to run until the process is done, ie stops
running.  This happens as well with things like gopher/pine/elm if
the user is disconnected.  Idleout doesn't work.  stty hup, hupcl doesn't
work. 

                        Thanks...

AFAIK, there are two version of the thing. An original gcc 2.4.0 from

Subject: inetd seems to lock-up
Date: 1 Oct 1994 19:27:36 GMT

While trying to connect a linux box to the internet i got a strange
behaviour. The machine first accepts telnet or any other inetd 
initiated connection, while a few minutes later doing the same thing
will hang. Thus, trying to telnet into the box yields the
connected to message, but there is no prompt.
This happens with every connection which is handled by inetd,
like ftp, finger, etc...
After a long delay of maybe several hours (maybe only a few minutes)
the machine again accepts connections, but after a short time it hangs
again.

Weirdly, a lpmud driver running permanently listening to port 7680 runs
perfectly, thus i guess the fault has something to do with inetd.

I know about the order hosts, bind problem in /etc/resolv.conf, but this
should not matter, since there is a working nameserver on the local
network.

Anyone had that problem, too and solved it?

The machine:
486DX33/16MB, seagate 120MB ide drive, wd80*0 network card running
linux 1.1.51 with the tcpip package taken from slackware 2.0


Thanx,

Sure.  Set up a RAM drive in /etc/lilo.conf.

Of course, linux will use it fairly efficiently of its own if you
just let the buffer cache logic do its job.  More efficiently that
you can do with a RAM drive, probably.

I'm not sure which newsgroup this belongs in because I don't know if the
answer is just a configuration setting or requires a kernel hack.

Oh, yes, I have looked in the FAQ and HOWTO ... nothing there on this.

My hardware supports DMA only on the first 16 megabytes of RAM although
it will support up to 64 megabytes of RAM.  What I want to do is to have
Linux use only the first 16 megabytes in its usual way much as if the
machine only had 16 megabytes.  Then I want to use whatever remaining
memory above the 16 megabyte line I happen to have installed (it is OK
by me to have to code this somewhere) as a memory file system.  So if
I install all 64 megabytes of RAM I could have a 48 megabyte memory file
system.

The basic question is how to do this.  Also, do you know of any particular
problems one might encounter with this?  Is there some other scheme that
would let me utilize the extra memory to gain some speed?
