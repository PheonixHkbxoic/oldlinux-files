Hum. IMHO this depends on what you feed to gs (ie PostScript file), not on
gs itself.

From the Printing-HOWTO :

        0.3.5 Where do I get a printcap for a xxxxx?

        This question is essentially meaningless - see next question.


        0.3.6 The semantics of /etc/printcap

        Given    the  similarity   in   appearence  and   name  between
        /etc/termcap  and  /etc/printcap  one  could  be  forgiven  for
        assuming that  they contain  analogous infomation.  This is not
        the case. Whereas termcap  contains informations about terminal
        *types*    -   (mostly  escape   seqences)   printcap  contains
        information about *specific* printers  (like the directory that
        holds the spool queue and the  device name of the printer). The
        information about a printer model's  escape sequences and so on
        are held  in the various  filters which are  programs called by
        lpd  to  drive  the  printer.  /etc/printcap  simply  gives the
        locations  of  these  filters.  For  details  RTFM(printcap). [
        Alternatively the net-HOWTO  has a summary of  some of the more
        important fields. ]
 
(thanks to Grant Taylor and Brian McCauley, authors.
 the Printing HOWTO officially lives in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO

Yes.  Works just fine too.  Actually, I had an easier time setting up

than I did getting Mosaic and TCP/IP for Windoze for Workgroups working.
Check out sunsite in the /pub/Linux/system/Network/info-servers

- If you hear some _looping_ sound before the timeout, you have an IRQ
  conflict.

- If you hear no sound at all, you have a DMA conflict.

- If everything works OK for some time but sound stops after some
  SCSI activity, you have just bad luck. PAS16 and AHA1542 are known to
  be incompatible. There is just a minor possibility that adjusting the
  bus on/off times of AHA solves this problem. Does anybody have experience

Subject: Zmodem errors at 38400 w/16C550
Date: 25 Sep 1994 02:53:00 -0000

I just installed a pair of internal BOCA V.FAST 28,800 bps modems into 2 
Linux systems. I have the line speed set to 38400 on both ends (stty 
confirms speed) and Zmodem works great with text files (3800 bps). 
However, when I try to transfer a compressed file, I get lots of errors 
and the transfer aborts. I know that the modem can't actually handle data 
that is already compressed at that high a speed, but shouldn't flow 
control prevent over running the chip's FIFO ? If I reduce the speed to 
19,200, the compressed files transfer fine, but less than half the speed 
(1800 bps). I'd be really happy if the compressed files would transfer at 
a higher speed. Anyone have any ideas ?

BTW: I have the same problem when using DOS/Telix on the receiving end.

A friend of mine justed landed me a IBM HD-Drive to check.

I've connected it to my PAS16 scsi port, and rebooted, 
here are the loggin messages, can someone give me some 
explications/interpretation?
 
Note that the PAS16 scsi is my second, my first is Adaptec 1742A. But no

Even easier: use col.
man blah | col | lpr

This will give you the man apges printed out without the funky control
characters and you don't need to worry about pre-compiled, compressed, etc
man pages.

I'm using gs with a DeskJet 560c, but the options (with the
exception of the -sDEVICE shoudl be the same.  Mine is hooked
through a lpr filter, here is the exact file:

gs -q -dSAFER -sDEVICE=cdj550 -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=- -

I think that the important thing is to supress the dialog
messages that gs prints to stdout/errout during processing.

The IBM TCP/IP for DOS product with the NFS option should work fine

I use the base product but haven't had a reason to try the NFS option.
You may find this slightly less pricy than some of the commercial

Thanks! I'm going to get mgetty+sendfax software, and I excluded
