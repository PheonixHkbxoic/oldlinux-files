        My linux box is in Wonder Land!

        My machine stopped booting (either 1.1.27, 1.1.50, or 1.1.52)
        with the message vaguely like:
        Unable to handle page request at virtual address ...
        right after the partition check (before mounting root).

        I can boot from a floppy, mount all my partitions, install the swap.
        But no way to boot from my IDE drive. 
        I reinstalled lilo, fsck'ed all my partitions, rebuilt the
        swap, shuffled memory simms, but still...
        Oh! BTW, dos still works but what can I do with it? :-(

Yeah, what Patrick said.

Surely the man who thinks his breaking into MY machine and using MY 
system resources for something I didn't intend is not a crime wouldnot 
mind if I broke into his car and borrowed it to run drugs??? I'll return

As Patrick ably poinetd out the issue is that the system in question

I posted a similar article to comp.unix.questions a few days ago and 
thought I would come to you all too.  I want to know if there is a DOS 
linker for Linux?  I know SCO has one available and I need to finish up a 
DOS project (chuckle chuckle) but I don't want to give up the Linux 
environment.  What my plans were.... 
        a) find a linker (I like this idea <g>)
        b) see if DJGPP's linker will compile and work easily under Linux)
        c) write one... (EGADS I don't like this IDEA at all)

Thanks
Paul 

BTW - I could just reboot and load DOS 6.2, but the novelty of writing 
DOS apps under Linux is... well funny to me.

IMHO the best one is E0Q2, that is modem response codes enabled in originate
mode (for things such as uucp dialout chat-scripts), and disabled in answer
mode (then you just have to find a getty that opens the serial port in
blocking mode : it will sit around till it senses something on the Carrier
Detect line.)

This reminds me of the joke:
A guy is driving on the higway and listens to the radio. It say: "Attention!
There is a crazy driver driving the wrong way on the highway!" The guy is 
amazed: "One? All of them!"...

Seriously. I do not agree with you. If 99% of admins are against your opinion 
you still might be right, but the probabilities are *very* low.
And if you want to be shown something you really steal when breaking in,
then two things:
CPU cycles. Others have to pay for them and you don't pay. (Yes, even 
universities have a theoretical value for CPU hours and if they sell 
time to companies they have to pay for it, even if the ordinary user,
e.g. an employee of the univ, or a student doesn't have to pay, and it 
seems free.)
You yourself mentioned that you might break in just to use a compiler
you do not have access to. Well, wherever you break in and they have that 
compiler, they have paid for it. (It might be a free software, but I don't 
think so, since in that case you likely would have to access to it.) So
if they paid for it then you are using other's property without their
permission.
These are just two examples and I'm sure there are more.

I do hope that in time you'll realize that you are mistaken - at least in
the opinion of 99% of the admins.

   than that.... Could someone point out what I'm missing in my XF86config?

You need to specify the RAMDAC.  Evidentally the X server isn't
detecting it.  On my board (an Actix GraphicsEngine UltraPlus S3
card), The X server would hang because it couldn't figure out the
RAMDAC.  Try running SuperProbe to see what kind of ramdac you have, &
then put the apropriate command in your XF86Config file.  I'd tell you
the command, but I've only installed 3.1 at home & I'm at work now.
In any case, the man pages (either for XF86Config, or for XF86_S3)
should document the exact command.

Also, to get 16bit color, I had trouble getting the line directly to X
via startx.  The command "startx -- -bpp 16" didn't work - I still
ended up with 8 bit color.  Finally, I started the X server by hand
using "X -bpp 16", & then switched back to a console, where I set my
DISPLAY variable & started the window manager.  I then got 16bpp
color.

Good luck,

If you have Linux in mind and if "performance" has to include "features",
there is only one choice today. Guess which. ;-)

A busmaster DMA SCSI controller can save you some CPU time; on the
other hand, you can get much more than the maximum double speed transfer
