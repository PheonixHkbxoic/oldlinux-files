   work.  I then ping'ed some hosts using the real IP address - nothing work.

Had the same messages on my system to.  I am not running the named daemon
though, and it did not bring my system down.  My network manager explained
it to be my kernel making a request through the wrong gateway, and thereby
getting the rigth way to go back from the router.

The fix which worked for me was putting another line in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
(running Slackware 2.0.0) which contained the correct information about the
gateway to use.  This is the line:

/sbin/route add -net 158.38.62.0 gw 158.38.60.250

where of course 158.38.62.0 is the net I am trying to reach using
158.38.60.250 as the gateway.  Since you are using the named daemon
I don't know if this is the rigth thing for you to do, but I guess
it is worth trying. 

   Can someone tell me what the "redirect from 128.97.175.1" means??
   This machine has been running solidly for at least 3 months now.

To me it came with one of the kernels between 1.1.18 and 1.1.51, but
I don't know which, as I upgraded directly.

        I feel the  Slackware 1.2 is OLD...  Thus the driver
        source file might have been moved since then..

        At the moment there is no way to externally tell the kernel to look
        at somewhere non-standard -- except at my own machine. (Linux 1.1.52)
        I have been developing LILO options for AHA1542, which lets users
        like you to override the default locations (and to set some other
        more esoteric configuration parameters...)

        For now your option is:
                - install the Adaptec on 330, deinstall the MIDI/Sound
                  for a moment
                - generate new kernel AFTER you have edited the
                        /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/aha1542.c
                  to look for the new controller location(s).
                  Edit the file, and start by looking for '0x330' in it.
                  Preceeding comment explains what to do with it.
                - install that new kernel, change your Adaptec,
                  install the MIDI/Sound-card..

        This SHOULD be FAQ, I guess -- I hope my LILO-things are

The "Motif" version is better.  Check-out:

 http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/mpeg_play/mpeg_play.html

Although, all the mpeg_play programs seem unstable.  i.e. If the
mpeg file is even slightly corrupted they tend to core dump or
at the very least abort the rest of the file.

Upgrade now. You'll see a quantum leap in X performance. The difference
between 4M and 8M is far more significant than the one between 8M and 16M,

Since I first posted this I've noticed that if I run a telecomm program
everything works fine. The modem doesn't have to be off hook, I just
have to have either minicom, seyon or term running. I don't understand
why these things are connected. The modem is on comm 1 and the dumb (really
dumb) terminal is on comm 3. Since the modem doesn't have to be off hook
it apparently needs to be initialized for my dumb terminal to work. Can
someone please explain?

Download the sources for the newest version (lynx2-3-1).  It has 
the linux-ncurses entry that I submitted.  They sort of screwed up
the entry though.  Edit the Makefile and find the entry for
linux-ncurses.  You need to add -DFANCY_CURSES to the defines, this is
the option which allows the nice looking (highlighted, not reversed)
links.  I have also changed my setup to use optimization (makes a large
difference in the speed! ;-) ).  Then compile with:

make linux-ncurses

Try "mixer +rec line". That does it for my PAS16 soundcard. The mixer

I am running Yggdrasil P&P (summer 1994). It used to check the
