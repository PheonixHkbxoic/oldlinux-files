Subject: starting nfsd from inetd?
Date: Thu, 1 Sep 1994 05:46:16 GMT


It is possible to start RPC programs from inetd instead of having
them running all the time. However, if I add

nfs/2          dgram   rpc/udp wait    root    /usr/etc/rpc.nfsd       rpc.nfsd
mountd/1       dgram   rpc/udp wait    root    /usr/etc/rpc.mountd     rpc.moun

to /etc/inetd.conf and restart inetd, it doesn't work. why?

rstatd/1-3     dgram   rpc/udp wait    root    /usr/etc/rpc.rstatd     rpc.rsta

doesn't work either (If rstatd is started from inetd, it causes
portmapper on the server and rstat on the client (linux) machine to go
berserk).


however, these RPC programs do work when started from inetd:

rusersd/2-3     dgram   rpc/udp wait    root    /usr/etc/rpc.rusersd    rpc.ruse
walld/1         dgram   rpc/udp wait    root    /usr/etc/rpc.rwalld     rpc.rwal
pcnfs/1-2       dgram   rpc/udp wait    root    /usr/etc/rpc.pcnfsd     rpc.pcnf


*walld acts funny on my system, but it does the same thing whether I start
it from inetd or not.

        :pl#59:\
        :pw#80:

create an executable file:
# deskjet.filter
#------------snip----------
#!/usr/bin/perl
while (<STDIN>) {
print ($_,"\r");
}
#-----------snip-----------

Thats it !
(I know there are several more possibilities to do this - but this works)

Hope this helped....

Probably "root" is in more than 8 groups on your machine. Many older
NFS servers, including SOSS, don't like this.

Edit /etc/group to remove root from some groups, logout, login again,
then try again.

Why on Earth are you backing up your /proc file system? It's meaningless.

If you use GNU tar, you can use the -l option to stay within one file system, 
and not back up /proc.

Sorry, this is wrong. There are 2 speeds here; the first is the line speed
the modems talk to each other at (DCE<->DCE rate), the second is the speed
your machine talks to your modem (DTE<->DCE rate).

The Sporster, as the 14400 implies, is capable of a line speed of 14.4k/s
(V32bis). It's also capable of 9.6K (V32) and lower. When 2 V32bis modems
connect, they can test the line to see what maximum line speed it's quality
will support.

Compression comes in 2 flavours; MNP 5 and V42bis. MNP 5 is capable,
theoretically, of 2:1 compression, so you can drive a modem that's
connected at 14.4k (DCE rate) at 28.8 (DTE rate). V42bis theoretically
manages a max of 4:1 compression, so you can drive the modem at 57.6k.
Both of these are optimistic top ends and should be taken with a
pinch of salt, in practise.

V42bis is generally considered the better of the 2 protocols, as MNP 5
can actually cause a performance drop when transferring compressed files.
V42bis is "smart" enough to know that the file is already compressed, and
doesn't try to compress it any further. However, I've seen reports that
MNP 5 is better at compressing UUencoded files than V42bis.

Both compression schemes require error correction to be in operation.
MNP 2-4 are used with MNP 5, and LAP-M is used with V42bis.

Your modem should be configured to try for a "best possible" connection
first (V32bis/V42/V42bis), and to only drop back from this if a) the line
quality won't support it, b) the other end's modem doesn't support it.
All modems capable of it should be set for RTS/CTS hardware handshaking,
(&H1,&I0,&R2 on the Sportster, I *think*) as opposed to Xon/Xoff, if
supported. At a DCE - DCE rate of 14.4k, the DTE-DCE rate should be at
least 38.4k *provided* that you don't get hardware overruns at this speed,
as these kill TCP/IP throughput.

I'm afraid it's a case or RTFM to configure the modem to do this.

If that's compressed files, it's about right. If it's text, it's low.

Hello Linux friends.  I am having problems with NFS-exporting to a
domain.  My /etc/exports looks like this (abbreviated)

/usr ramius(rw,link_absolute) ahab(rw)
/usr/nuars w9bgx.nuars.nwu.edu(rw)
/usr/linux *.nwu.edu(ro)
/ solo(rw)

I have tried with the ancient nfsd I had on my system, which fails
with a strange error (cannot get root inode, and a lot of other
veribage) and nfs-server-2.0 from the sunacm directory on sunsite,
which fails with a permission denied when I try it from other hosts in
the *.nwu.edu domain.

Is this a known problem, and if so, what do I need to do to fix it?
This system will hopefully be used by our incoming freshmen to install
Linux on their machines in the fall, so I'm quite eager to get this
running.  My network admin has vetod exporting it to the world, so I
need this working.

Humongous thanks in advance,

Ok, this isn't an explanation or a cure, but only a record of

where, at one point when I was copying to the floppy, there 
was a write to the floppy that just never stopped.  I did 
kill -9  PID and that didn't stop it,.  Nothing would stop it and 
a reset was the only thing that would.  ctrl-alt-del would not
even work.  That was with 1.1.48.  So, I'd like to know how 
1.1.49 does with the floppies.  I didn't expect to see that

Then you're probably a victim of a braindead default configuration. A
port at 0x3bc usually uses IRQ 7.

But please check that you don't have another port (usually at 0x378)
that uses IRQ 7 as well. This is a HARDWARE problem, you have to check
the jumpering of the ports; not using one of the conflicting ports does
not help.

For a usual configuration, you have to edit drivers/net/Space.c and to
change the IRQ for plip0 to 7.

AFAIK, they are _not_ compatible. Try using the same kernel version on
both machines. I'm not entirely sure at what kernel version the

Hi together,

I just  have had a little bit of luck and got an used Exabyte streamer
from my company (for nearly no $$ :-) ).
Unfortunately it seems that linux don't like such a beast :-(
I plugged it in and everything seems to be okay. While booting the
kernel tells me Target 5  Exabyte Model: EXB-8200 Rev. 4.25  SCSI-1
But when I try to access the device nothing happens.
The streamer had been connected to an old SUN but I haven't got any
documentation. Did I miss something or doesn't Linux support Exabytes?

By the way, of cause I created the device files.

Any clues

Subject: smail bug ?
Date: 1 Sep 1994 11:49:32 GMT

Just before summer I saw a posting somewhere stating a security hole in
smail v3.1.28.1 causing the "mail-bouncer" to run scripts as root...
Does anybody know anything about this one, or is it a misconfigure on this
particular guys site ?
I'd like some more info to track it down if it really *is* a hole here...
Tell me if you know anything, please !
