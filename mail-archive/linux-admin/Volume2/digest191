Hmm.  Does Sun's OS do a good job of sharing libraries and executables?
Linux should need only one copy of libc, libX11, LibXaw, libXt, xterm,
fvwm, etc in memory at once.  All each successive user needs is the
local data space.  I suspect 8M + 4M/user is a better estimate for
Linux, although I haven't tried it.  I am about to go from 8M to 16M,
and that should take me from 0 users to 2 users - sounds about right :-).

I have the same problem :) I already have a very well connection to the

route my Novell Netware through the Linux box. I don't know why Linux

You can you /etc/lilo.conf instead. E.g:
# LILO configuration file
# generated by 'liloconfig'
#
# Start LILO global section
boot = /dev/sda7
#compact        # faster, but won't work on all systems.
# delay = 5
vga = -2
ramdisk = 0     # paranoia setting
# End LILO global section
# Linux bootable partition config begins
image = /vmlinuz
  root = /dev/sda7
  label = linux
  read-only

I changed my root password, being security conscious, but apparently changed it
to something I can't repeat. I have tried all the combinations of what I
thought I used but to no avail.

The way I have tried to get out of this mess is by bring up my system in 
single user mode, which works, and then changing the password. The problem is
the system indicates that it has mounted my files as rw but everything behaves
as if has been mounted read-only. If I cat mtab it shows (rw). I am new to
Unix and especially to 'Unix administration'. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

at 40 Mhz with a TI 486DLC-40 chip on it.

So when is AMD comming out with a 486dx4-120? :-)

XFree86-3.1 is neet alright, but is anyone having problems with the 
WD90C33 part of the SVGA server?  When I start a new application with 
color buttons, xpaint for example, parts of the buttons leave residue on 
the screen.  The "residue" "sticks" to the glass, so no matter which part 
of the virtual desktop I am on, it is still there.  The effect is 
cumulative and won't go away.  Is there a root window refresh? or maybe a 
function to redraw the whole screen?

: Yeah, have a look at /etc/resolv.conf. There might be a reference to an

: (perhaps) your delay. Also have a look at /etc/host.conf whether bind

We have a similar login problem, especially when connecting to a MUSH
port.  The connection from a remote host can (sometimes) sit there forever.
If, however, from the machine I connect to that port (telnet localhost 7567)
the connection from remote becomes instantly connected.  We were at first
thinking this is a problem with our code, as regular telnet appears to
work okay(who knows where that lag comes from? :).  But these
problems  may be related.  Running 1.1.49 on a Slackware setup.

If you typed 'mkswap' instead of 'mke2fs' then you haven't lost anything
that mke2fs would not have destroyed anyway. So just go ahead and do the
mke2fs again.

Now, if you did mkswap on the wrong partition or something, then you
would be in trouble, but no more trouble than if you had done mke2fs 
on the wrong partition.

   Nope.  Just plain false.  No measurable "busy waiting" is used for IDE drives
   under linux.  Read/Write operations are interrupt driven, not polled.
   Note that the effect of this is unnoticeable under most single-user situations,
   since writes are deferred by the buffer-cache, and reads usually imply that
   the user is sitting there waiting for the data anyhow.  With lots of processes
   running and performing I/O, the general (unproven) opinion is that SCSI really
   ought to perform better.  I agree.

Results on my system 486dx2-66 with SIDE enhanced IDE VL-bus
controller and Buslogic 445s SCSI-2 result in similar transfer speeds
for the two (within 20%) but in the case of IDE the CPU is more than
95% busy and with SCSI it is less than 50%.

I don't know what the CPU is doing and I don't think it really
matters, whether its waiting, busy making commands to the disk or
transfering data - the net result is that the use of SCSI leaves much
more resources for other processes.

Subject: NFS not enabled in q2/idekern.cfg Slak 2.0.1
Date: Mon, 10 Oct 94 18:55:39 GMT

Hi,

Dont know if anyone already noticed this. Ignore if so.

I was trying to install the 1.1.18 kernel from the q1/idekern.tgz
on Slackware 2.0.1 and found that NFS mounting was not possible.

Turns out that the idekern.cfg shows that the kernel was compiled
with NSF disabled! Here's the extract:

        if [ "$CONFIG_INET" = "y" ]; then
        bool 'NFS filesystem support' CONFIG_NFS_FS n
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So I had to install scsikern.tgz instead which works fine, though
hogs a little more space. However, on one machine (Compaq 386/20),
the scsikern creates some funny errors, so I had to stick to the
standarad 1.0.9 issued. 

Could the person who maintains the distribution please fix this?


Thanks

I am running a multi-line SLIP dialin server. For months we have had problems 
that sometimes the "sliplogin" program was not getting killed.  We finally 
found that the problem is in the Kernel " close() " function; this function 
does sometimes *not return*.  We have fixed the problem with a patch that 
re-kills the program after a 15 second timeout, when it is still 'alive'. The 
problem is definately in the kernel, but we have never found anybody who could 
do something about it.  Our dirty patch keeps our system online, but does not 
fix the root of the problem.  You problem could very well be the same.
