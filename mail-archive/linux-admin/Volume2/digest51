Just so you are aware, by giving users the ability to mount file systems, 
you ARE giving anyone with a reasonable knowledge of UNIX root 
permissions to your machine. All they need is roto permissions on another 
Linux machine (all to easy, since Linux is preading fast).  They create a 
shell with setuid to root, owned by root, then mount it on your system 
and run the shell.

This is why mount permissions are usually reserved for root alone on UNIX 
systems.  We are talking a MAJOR security hole otherwise.  (Remember that 
UNXI was designed for mini-computers, where new volumes were almost never 
mounted except for software installation or tape back-ups.)A

Well, I don't know a lot about this, but aren't there ways to get syslogd to 
do this kind of thing?

Or, if you're looking for something simpler, the command "last -3 user" will 
give you the last 3 logins of user, telling you where they logged in from and 
for how long...  It uses a file called "wtmp" and if someone knows of a way to 
grep through it (it's in some weird format), you could extract the info you 
need...  Careful, though...  I think that this file is wiped and retouched on 
boot up (you'd have to update your accounting after booting everyone off but 
before the system restarts in your "shutdown" routine)

Hope this gets the discussion going...

Yes.. a problem with ftp, but probably not with rlogin/telnet (at least on a
commercial system).  As far as Linux is concerned, you could probably modify
the kernel tcp/udp code to log outgoing connections.

However, the OUTPUT command does not seem to work for sending HEX 00. Any

Result : only \4 were transmitted!

Subject: Need DL/Time Limiting ideas - Linux BBS
Date: 11 Sep 1994 12:27:14 -0600

I'm currently in the process of setting up a BBS under Linux.  All of the 
BBS software I've seen for Linux already is cryptic, difficult to use for 
callers used to MS-DOS boards, and not very configurable.  For this 
reason I've decided to write a BBS using a conglomeration of shell 
scripts and the menu system program used at Nyx (A public access UNIX 
site at nyx.cs.du.edu).  This is getting to be very tedious.  I'm using 
programs already written to accomplish message bases and E-mail, however 
I have to FTP the source (over my provider's 2400bps dial-up :( ) and 
modify it to eliminate shell escapes and other security hazards.  This is 
also very time consuming.  I'm willing to stick with this however because 
of the configurability.  However, my biggest problem is finding a way to 
limit login times and establish an upload/download ratio system.  If you 
have ideas on how I could accomplish this with shell scripts or simple C 
programs let me know.

I'm concerned with the security of using shell scripts like this.  It 
seems secure so far, but you never know.  That's why I'd also be 
interested in hearing about pre-written BBS software for Linux that will 
offer what I'm looking for.  The system I am planning will be largely 
information based (offering topics of all kinds, kind of like Internet).  
I'll use the gopher system (which is already set-up and merely needs to 
be called from the BBS) as a means to access this information.  I need 
the BBS software that will provide message and file areas as well as 
E-mail.  It would also be nice to have FIDO (internal or external, 
doesn't matter) support and Usenet support.  The system should be easy to 
use because a majority of my users will be used to MS-DOS type boards 
like Renegade and Tag.  Since my service provider only has a 2400bps 
dial-up I don't want to download all the Linux packages.  Recommendations 
will be most welcome.

Also, if I can figure out how and get somebody to provide an inexpensive 
link, I'd like to allow Internet E-mail and news on the system.  Who 
should I contact about this?  I've heard of UUCP.  Is there an integrated 
network of epople that do this already that can provide some pointers?  
Can it be done cheap?  This will probably be a non-profit system.  Is 
there another BBS in the Detroit area that I can poll if I decide to take 
that route.

I have a lot of questions and if you've read up to the end of this 
message I appreciate it already.  Anybody with replies or pointers for 
any of the problems I've had so far, please E-mail me.  (I normally do 
not read alt.bbs and alt.bbs.unixbbs, however I do read comp.os.linux.admin.)

Thanks.

The appropriate options make it quite safe; here's an entry from my system's
/etc/fstab:

/dev/fd0        /dos-a      msdos       user,noauto

This means that any user can type 'mount /dos-a' and get the floppy all
for herself, without nasty suid root problems.

See 'man 8 mount'.

there is support for limiting login times and for logging out users
in the shadow passwd package. There is no support for limiting the
time a user is logged in though.

This is a very good explanation of the procedure for large IDE drives.
The only thing I would add, is what to do if it's your second physical
drive that's the big one. That's the situation I had and it drove me
half nuts because no one ever gave an example the the hd= incantation
for the second drive. It turns out to be really simple. I my case, my
firs drive is 424 megs and under the 1023 limit while my second drive
is 730 megs and over the 1023 cylider limit. When you get to  the boot
prompt in a situation like this, you include a hd= statement for BOTH 
drives even though the first one (in my case) was no problem. So, in
my example it looked like this boot: ramdisk hd=989,15,56 hd=1416,16,63.
To get lilo to work, you'll have to put these two lines at the top of
your lilo.conf file: append="hd=989,15,56 hd=1416,16,63" and on the next
line: linear.  Those numbers are for my drives, you'll have to substitute
the numbers for your drives. And you do need the quotes like in my example.
I've had lilo booting contentedly off of my large hard drive for quite some
time. Now if I could only figure out how to install lilo on a floppy. Why
doesn't this work? lilo -C /etc/lilo.conf -v -r /flop (where /flop is the
place I have /dev/fd0 mounted.

I've had the same problem.  When people log-in to my machine, the
login name is their nodename with a type-of-service character
prepended, so that foobar UUCP access would be Ufoobar, SLIP would
be Sfoobar, etc.   Unfortunately, I had problems when node names
were 8 characters or longer, so I had to issue shorter, fake ones.
