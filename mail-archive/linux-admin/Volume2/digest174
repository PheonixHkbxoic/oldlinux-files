Louis,

We use the 430NT. Had some problems with an earlier kernel (.99pl15) and 
the GNU-mt program unable to do "setblk". Upgraded to 1.0.9 and was able to 
use "setblk". The thing works fine.

As I understand it having suid root xterms is a security hole, although I
can't give a specific example.  It just makes me nervous.  I don't know
what would happen on a suid root xterm if someone were to do something
like xterm -e <command> .

Regardless, the problem seems to be non-init clients (such as xterm or
rxvt) reporting themselves to init as logins.  xdm actually supports this;
look into the sessreg command. I have been unable to get sessreg to work
however because the sysVinit that I have does wierd things with utmp and
wtmp such that sessreg cannot write to them.  I have not seen a drop-in
solution to the sessreg problem and am still waiting to see if one turns
up. 

I have a program that someone wrote which handles the sessreg function but
the author said that it functioned unreliably when he started using a
getty on his modem; then init was messing up the utmp and wtmp files and
his program was unable to write to them correctly.  If you want to see the
program I can mail it to you... 

However if someone telnets in and starts an xterm then sessreg wouldn't
see it and you still wouldn't have a record of the login.

I too am for reporting everything at once. How else will the things get
fixed? And, the truth often is that once someone discovers a security
hole, it soon spreads to the 'crackers'. Isn't it better for every
sysadmin to know and be able to fix the thing than for only a small

Is this different from the ncr5380 driver that is on the fall94 cd-rom?  
I'm wondering because I'm currently using that driver with my Trantor 
130B, an if there is a newer more rpeferrabled river I'll switch (I have 
rev b., but I haven't really examined it beyond getting my sony-cd to work.)

I may be dense, but I'm not following this.  Once I found out my disk 
geometry using speedstor, I was able to enter it with linux fdisk and 
parition my drive.  I boot fine at the moment, though not off of my HD 
becuase I haven't installed the cd-rom fix yet (new kernel from rev. b).

As I understand the situation (and I may be wrong...) is that the only 
time Linux actually needs the disk geometry info is during lILO boot (I'm 
pretty sure I read that somewhere.)  There is a table you can hand to 
LILO that will set the gemoetry staticly in cases like mine, which was 
what I was planning on doing some weekend when I had nothing better to do.
(Altough if this new rev b. kernel fixes the problem, I guess Ill just 
finish installing it.)

In any case, my setup at the moment looks like this:
Floppy Drive A: - Boot Disk
/dev/hda        - Small DOS parition and large swap partition
/dev/sda1       - root partition
/dev/sda2       - 'home' partition

Actually, now that I've done some more testing, I think I have a plain
old irq conflict. I have a mouse on com 2, my modem on com 1 and the dumb
terminal on com 3. According to everything I've read com 1 and com 3 share
the same irq as does com 2 with com 4. My BIOS lets me choose different
irq settings from what the defaults are supposed to be but I noticed that
when I boot linux it says that com 1 and 3 are set to irq 4 (even though
my BIOS says com 1 is on 4 and com 3 is on 5). I tried moving the dumb 
terminal to com 4 and it worked fine but, as expected, my mouse died.
So how is one supposed to get the convenience of a mouse and a modem and
still be able to connect an dumb terminal at the same time?

Go read comp.unix.security, where there's a lot more information on this.
Having the *complete* information on what a fault is can be essential -
if you are running a network which includes machines of different types,
being able to check the bug on all these machines makes a big difference.

Simply knowing there is an unspecified bug for a small list of platforms is
hardly ideal - how do you know that whoever compiled the list bothered to check 
all your platforms?

Even with SCSI you often have two scsi controllers as CD-ROMS often tie the bus
for ages with their low transfer rate. I'm in the middle of finishing
sorting out our computer society system once we get a bigger case - then it
will be 2 IDE controllers, 3 IDE drives, 2 SCSI drives on a SCSI controller,
4 serial ports, 3 parallel ports, ethernet and floppy on one ISA bus. 

I suspect bus contention becoming a performance issue 8)

You will also have to create (just for the heck of it), two newsgroups,

ctlinnd to create the groups for you (dunno how... just do it the hard way:)

If you have an unpatched 1.1.51 kernel, get 1.1.52. It fixes some

I too have got precisely as far as Andy Dickinson (see below) and
encountered exactly the same problems. The only solution I have
been able to implement is to create a user account on my own machine
in the same name ("efh") as on the mail-server wich I connect to,
and to be logged in on my own machine as "efh" for mail purposes,
even though I would like to send mail from "root" or "ted" on my
machine. This is feasible, even though inconvenient, on a Linux
machine because of tghe ease of switching between virtual consoles.
Using "selection" to copy chunks of text between consoles also helps.
My smail is Smail3.1.28.1 #28.1.

Reply-To: Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk (Ted Harding)

Brian Kramer asks:-

| I am having trouble with some scripts running fine from a prompt, but not
| from cron.  Here's one of the scripts.  Anyone else have problems like this?

I notice that this script includes lines like

        backupmenu()
        {
        echo "Usage backup <what>\n"
        echo "<what>:  full (Full backup) ";
        echo "         root (Root partition /) ";

        echo "         inn  (Inn partiton /usr/lib/news)\n ";
        }

Now, where are the "echo"s supposed to appear when the script is run by
cron? And what console is the input supposed to come from?
When the script is run from a prompt, stdout (and stderr) will
appear on the screen where the prompt is, which can be found out from
the system admin files (utmp I think). Cron doesn't know what console
the script is supposed to write to. One solution would be to reserve
a particular console (I use /dev/tty1) as "system console", so that
the 1st two lines above, for instance, could be changed to

        echo "Usage backup <what>\n" > /dev/tty1 2>&1
        echo "<what>:  full (Full backup) "; > /dev/tty1 2>&1

My guess is that if all lines of the script which write to stdout were
changed to write >/devtty1 2>&1, and all lines which read from stdin
were changed to read </dev/tty1, then the script would work. Could
be wrong - this suggestion is necessary but may not be sufficient!

Subject: Where to find acct for 1.1.49+?
Date: Sun, 09 Oct 1994 10:06:44 +0930

Hello all

Some time ago I had the address for the ftp site that had the process
accounting patch for kernel above 1.1.18.

As you may have guessed I have lost this address and therefore am now
begging for someone to enlighten me as to where I might find this.

I have looked in the regular places but have come up empty handed.

Any pointer???
thanks
Andrew
