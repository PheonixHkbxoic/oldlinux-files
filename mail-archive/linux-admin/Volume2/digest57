Hi Linux/X/Mosaic gurus ( can you guess what I'm going to ask ? :-) )

Yes, You've guessed it - I want to compile/install mosaic on my linux box. 
X is working quite happily, but I need to know what to do to compile mosaic,
i.e. decent makefile settings etc. If anybody can give me the noddy guide
to Mosaic under linux, I'd be really grateful.

please, could you e-mail me direct as I've got a really SLOW news feed.

thanks,

Eamonn

right makefile settings ( best guess and a following wind - I'm no X programmer
)

They all do. Even the SGI version. I think it's quite cute. Shows just how
literally it was ported. Then again, that message could come from the WAD

I have my Lilo set up to ask whether I want to run DOS or Linux at boot-up.
The problem is, if I crash the machine remotely, and I manange to re-boot
it, it will stay at the Lilo prompt until I can get back to my room to hit
enter (to run linux).  Is there a way to set up Lilo so that after a minute,
it will automatically choose the "default" choice?

Subject: Partitioning Question
Date: 12 Sep 1994 18:09:47 GMT

So once I set my partitions (say 250 for Linux and 270 for DOS) using FIPS
or FDISK - is there a way to resize the Linux partition?  I mean, is there a
way other than backing up all the data on the Linux partition, deleting that
partition, then resizing the DOS partition, then remounting the Linux partition,
then restoring the data on it.

I've downloaded quite a bit of stuff for installing Linux.  I don't remember
exactly, but I think it was all the a,ap,x,xd,xv and a few other disks (all the
gnu stuff too).  All tolled, I think I've got about 40+.  The HOWTO says a
ROUGH estimate is about 2.5 megs per disk.  I'm just not sure how much to
allocate for this thing.  250 seems fine but I would love to get away with 200
so DOS would have more room to breathe.

Thanks,

Subject: Term and NNTP security probs???
From: williamj@cs.uni.edu ( Jonathan Williams )
Date: 12 Sep 94 12:28:09 -0500

I've just recently (a month ago) gotten linux installed on my box at home, and
this past week I've spent setting up term v1.19.  What I'd like to do is set
term up so that I can read my news from home, since they're yanking the
account that I've got tin on in the next week or so.

Supposedly, I can run term and use tredir to redirect my nnpt port from my
local port 119 to a remote nnpt feed.  I've checked with the guy who runs the
machine that I want to get my nntp feed from, but he's worried about security.
He's afraid that I'll be able to configure my machine at home to have any
internet address I want, and he considers that to be a security risk.

Are his fears warrented?  I know that I can change my internet address, and I
figure that it would be that address and not the address of the unix box that
I'm running the term client on at school that would show up if someone wanted
to trace the users of port 119, but is there a way to set it up so that the
address would show up as that of the unix box at school?

Subject: Linux ques. Only root can sendmail. Help please.
Date: Mon, 12 Sep 94 09:15:34 GMT


I don't think this is an smail question, but more Linux related
therefore I am posting it here. If I am wrong, please don't
flame me.

I am running Linux 1.0 with uucp Taylor 1.04 and smail 3.1.28
for a uucp only site.

I am able to succesfully send mail between local users and also 
to the internet, but ONLY as a root user. All other users cannot
send mail to the internet via my uucp host.

Using pine or the command line as a user other than root, gives no error
message. I have read all HOW-TO's, readmes, manuals, man notes
and spent several long days on this. 

I think I was able to do this until I tried to instal cnews :-(
I used /usr/lib/smail/tools.linux/mkconfig to set up my config files.
Since it works for the root user, I feel it may be a Linux problem.

I would sincerely appreciate any help. 

Below are the details of my /usr/spool/smail/logs/logfile. It 
clearly show how local mail works ok, mail sent by root to an
external user (vmittal@ecs.umass.edu) is ok, however, mail sent
by any other user (vmittal) to an external user *does not* work.

I would appreciate any help. 

Thankyou very much.

Regards,

Vikram.

There is a program (test-mouse) which is distributed as part of the

       [-m mouse-device] [-p l|m|r] [-s sample-rate] [-t mouse-type]

    -a accel         sets the acceleration (default 2)

    -c l|m|r         sets the copy button (default `l')
    -d delta         sets the delta value (default 25)

You must, of course, have killed selection prior to firing this up.

Subject: *** Why can't Linux access partitions with Linux FDISK? ***
Date: 12 Sep 1994 18:36:12 GMT


Hello one and all...

In setting up the partitions of my 540 MB hard disk,
I have created only one partition on this disk - a 380 MB
MS-DOS partition.

    Question: am I correct in assuming that one (and only one)
    MS-DOS (primary) partition is required on the entire hard disk?

Correct me if I'm wrong... you don't create a Linux partition using
MS-DOS' FDISK utility.  The Install Documentation is a little vague
to me on this. 

After creating the boot and root disks with bare.gz and
color144.gz, and after having booted my PCI Pentium PC into
Linux, I run into the following problems...

I run SETUP, and it tells me that I do not have Linux
partitions set up.  Next I enter 

    fdisk /dev/hda2

and then I get the message

    Cannot read /dev/hda2

or any other /dev for that matter.  Is there something that
I am missing here?

iI have a 486DX-33,8 Meg ram and cheap 1M VLB. Under Doom Dos hte game moves
quite well but with slight lapses, this may be my panic during play :-)))

With X the game moves well enought to play , without sound. But....Even
in the smallest window it isn't quite right for me. When the window is active
Doom is GREAT! but the background is black except for traces of the window title
bares. When the other windows are active, they are fine, but DOOM is blacke!!

What's up. I havnt' seen anyone else see this prob..
