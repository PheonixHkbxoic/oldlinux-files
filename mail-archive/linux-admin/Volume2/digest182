Take a look at the /etc/rc.d directory, I believe the file rc.inet2
In this file the necessary rpc servers are not automatically configured
for use. You'll need the rpc.portmap (/sbin) rpc.nfsd abd rpc.pcnfsd at least

If you're not using root to map your drives, you might want to change the
rpc.mountd line into rpc.mountd -n which lets you mount drives as a non root
user.

I've this setup running a few days and seems stable enough. Originally I was
running FreeBSD-current, but now switched to Linux to compare the systems.
I found the Linux nfs implementation a bit slower than the *BSD versions, but
I haven't tested it much yet on the Linux box. Also when doing heavy compiles
on the Linux box, it seems to effect the nfs performance a great deal more
than that was the case while running the *BSD system. Hope this helps,

PS. I forgot to tell you, you might need to add the following line to
the file /etc/rpc

pcnfsd        1500001     pcnfs


The rpc.portmap program needs this line. After running check with rpcinfo
if the portmapper is initialised correctly.

I have a kernel which correctly boots and works from floppy.
I copied the kernel to /vmlinuz.  When I attempt to
run lilo I get the following message:

Kernel vmlinuz too big!

What is this really telling me?

I get the error when attempting to install to Master Boot Partition
or the Boot record of the first partition. The first parition is flagged
as bootable.

Do I need to leave more room before defining partition 1.

I am running a Maxtor 340 mb drive with a linux native and linux swap

entering is guaranteed as you get a prompt if you break in.  

Succeed or not, you are guilty of trespass.  Succeed, you are guilty of 
breaking and entering.  EVEN IF YOU DO NOT DO ANYTHING BUT LOG OFF!

I'm looking for Mosaic for Linux compiled and linked to XFree 3.1 libraries.
Of course I can get Mosaic for XF2.x anywhere, but I don't have any of
the XFree 2.x stuff on my system, and I'm not real keen on putting the
libs on just to run Mosaic.

If you're wondering, I've got a GXE64 Pro, which is why I don't have any
of the XFree 2.x stuff on my system.  Running X at 640x480 didn't
particularly appeal to me.

To get lilo to look at an alternate address for you adaptec do the

prompts you for any additional parameter type in ramdisk
aha154x=0x230,scsiinterupt here,scsi host adapter id, hard drive host id

High response times you get from a system is most of the time due to to paging
and / or swapping. Adding a faster CPU will not help you very much. Adding
memory will. A nice rull of thumb is to have 8 Meg of memory for every
X display you manage, and an additional 4 Meg for the system software (and thus
you need about 12Meg for a stand alone system). Users only having one xterm
reading news will use less; power users will use more.

This 8 Meg is the amount of menory which is swapped in at a certain moment.
A window manager typically is used often, and stays swapped in. So running
this on a xterminal rather then on the host is a good way to save available RAM.
Besides that, it is one of the X client programs you have to wait for when
it should be paged in. Thaat is the major advantage of running it local -
switching to another window does not cost the time to swap in the 
window manager anymore (but still perhaps the time to swap in another client!)

(PS The above is based upon experiences with Sun Sparc 1 en 2 -- but will be
    similar for Linux boxes.)

:respond to what I am not saying.  It is also possible for someone to
:enter your house and do you no harm.  NOT "do you no wrong" but "do
:you no harm."  Can you accept this statemnt, with no implications?  

How are you defining "harm"?  My Webster's defines it:

        1 harm \'harm\ (noun)
        [ME, fr. OE hearm; akin to OHG harm injury, OSlav sramu shame]
        (bef. 12c)
        1: physical or mental damage: INJURY
        2: MISCHIEF, HURT 

        2 harm (verb)
        (bef. 12c)
        :to cause harm to
        syn see INJURE 

If you are simply trying to say "there is no physical damage", this may be  
true.  But _clearly_ there is psychological damage.  If you are just trying  
to say that the injured party will not suffer "physical" injury (to himself  
or his machine) -- perhaps you are right...  Well "whoop-de-doo"!   
Psychological _harm_ can sometimes last _much_ longer and be significantly  
more costly to correct than the "physical" harms.  I'd be willing to bet that  
someone who knows he's been cracked will spend a siginificant amount of time  
trying to plug the security holes on his system -- time isn't "Free".  I'd  
bet that the "harmed" party will spend some amount of time 'worrying' about  
the security of his system -- mental anguish is not "Free".

:Folks, opposing a statement that is true for what you think it may imply
:is pathetic.  First and foremost is the truth of a statement.   Statement
:"A" if true, is still true if the consequence of believing it is the
:destruction of all living things.  My point: do what you like.  People
:should not enter your system.  If you bend reality in your mind, you
:are pathetic.

First, you are "wrong"!  Second, it is people like you who give "Crackers"  
fodder for thier rationalizations.  Out of one side of your mouth you say,  
"no harm done", and out of the other you say "but it is wrong".  You can have  
"harm" without wrong-doing (accidents), but you can't have "wrong-doing"  
without harm.

The very idea that my computer (and it's cycles) is any less "real" than my  
house or my car is rediculous.  It is _mine_!  If I don't want other people  
using it -- then that is _my_ perogotive.  If you violate my security -- then  
you have stolen from me -- period.  It is no different than opening the  
closed door to my house.

By your logic, I could store food in your refrigerator -- simply because it  
causes _no_harm_ to you.  By your logic, I could borrow your phone whenever I  
want (so long as I call toll-free or local numbers) because it never impacts  
you "physically".  By your logic, I could steal your car while you are away  
(so long as you weren't trying to use it) -- and so long as I maintained it  
properly, and replaced whatever consumable items I used (gas, oil, wiper  
fluid, etc.) -- "no_harm_done".

It is _very_ convienent to re-invent "reality" to meet ones needs.  But the  
reality is: breaking into my house and breaking into my computer are the  
same.  And whether I choose to be forgiving or press charges (depending on  
the circumstances) is not relevant to the nature of the injury to me and my  
property.  I.E., if the cracker is a 12 yo. who is simply out "joyriding" on  
the InfoBahn -- he is no less responsible than the 12 yo. that breaks into my  
house (just to see if he can), or steals my car for a "joyride" -- but brings  
it back with "no_harm_done".
