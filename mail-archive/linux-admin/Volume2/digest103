Hello:

        Does anyone know whether it is possible to access a stacked drive
(Stacker version 3.1) while booting the linux partition? I have my hard
drive partitioned into dos and linux ones, and when I load linux, I can
access the parent dos partition (/dev/hda1) and I can also see the stacker
file (stacvol.000) ... but is there any way to access the files in the
stacked drive?

        Thank you in advance. Please mail reply to

it seems that if you install_component emacs, but not xprogs, you
cannot run emacs without having the CD in the drive.  it says:

        emacs: can't find library 'libX11.s0.3'

libX11.s0.3 is linked from /usr/lib/X11R6/lib/libX11.s0.3 to the /system_cd...

can someone recommend a solution?

Linux is available in several "distributions".  The one
I use is the Slackware distribution, and the latest
version can be ftp'ed from:

  sunsite.unc.edu : /pub/Linux/distributions/slackware

If you don't want to spend a day or two ftp'ing files,
you can get one of the distributions on CD-ROM.  They
can be had for any of several prices, some even include
OSF/Motif.

I find the documentation included in the Slackware 
distribution to be very adequate, and the admin tools
to be good (but then again, I'm a systems administrator).

You can find some good starter documentation on sunsite.


Hope this helps,

Hmmm... No.
The number must be unique in the "IPX network numbers" world, and getting
a number which is unique for IP does not guarantee anything.
The IP address of your system can be the same as the network number of
an IPX network!

As Alan Cox also indicated, there are two different methods of accessing
Netware from dosemu.  One uses the packet driver, and it fails when using
multiple dosemu boxes because they each use the same link-level address
and therefore Netware believes the second logon comes from the same PC
after a crash/reboot (I think).
The other method uses kernel IPX and should be a better way towards a
good solution.  But as you indicate there still are problems.

That's okay. The filesystem is checked only if the partition flag is not
clean (e.g. due to power-failure or switching the computer off without
halting the system) or if the maximal mount count is reached.

There are basically four files you are interested in:

        ppp-on
                ip-up

        ppp-off
                ip-down

Each one of them is a shell script (at least that works for me on my machine)

The first pair is used to setup a connection and take care of all the things
that  might be needed to use the interface.

The second pair does the opposite. 

The ip-up and ip-down are executed by the pppd so they really have nothing to 
do with the wrappers (ppp-on and off).  In my case they look something like this:

==================== ppp=on script begin ==============

Ok here they are.  There is still some problems though.  Namly I am having 
problems keeping the connection up automatically.. I have to manual run 
some command such as ping or something to keep it up.  The automatic  way
which I included in the above scripts doesnt work for me.  

I posted a question about it to the group too so maybe someone else knows.

Also there is no 'on-demand dailing' support in this version of pppd so
you can do somthing like telnet machine and have your modem dial it up
and establish a connection.

A daemon that can do that is dp-2.3 or somthingk like that but I am having
a hell of a time trying to port it to the Linux box.  Maybe someone with more
knowledge of the internals could do that.

I will make the above scripts nice and upload them to sunsite some time soon
or I can post them here since they are small enought if there is interest.

I hope that will help you get started.  I just got my box on the net in the
same way and it kicks.... (or blows chunks as my friend likes to refer to it) ;-)

I'm also looking for a automounter for linux and yes i've lokked at AMD,
but that isn't compatible with automiuntd for SUN's and other machines. So
that isn't a solution that I can use.. (it has to use auto.home/auto.master)
So if any one know about a automounter that does YP, plese tell me.

On the other hand, most of these utilities have been integrated into the 
World Wide Web protocol and can be accessed via clients. When you are 
using a terminal one could use Lynx for ftp, telnet connections, gopher
and much more! Definitively a great tool...
