The HP built-in ethernet should work "out-of-the-box" in a few weeks.  Look
for the updates in 1.1.52 or 1.1.53.

Hello: 
I have a Midwest Micro (DX2 66, 8 meg ram, 520 meg disk)
Dual-Scan Color. I can get X to work with the VGA16 driver
but not vga256.

This machine has 1 meg vram and 256 colors works fine under dos.

It seems that chipset is by Chips and Technology (the dos files
go by the name Chips655XX)
Superprobe hangs the machineine and produces nothing useful.
ConfigXF86 doesn't help either.

So: Do you have an Xconfig that will work??!!!


If so, many thanks in advance.

Better still mgetty from Gert Doering is even more easy to
install and comes with excellent docs. Look for mgetty+sendfax.

If you read the Makefile that comes with rxvt, it will tell you how to enable

Date: 6 Oct 1994 19:12:59 GMT

I just tried to install linux on my Dell 466/T, but I ran into a
real problem.  It looks like the driver for AHA-1542 SCSI controllers
only looks at the default address of 330.  Mine controller is at 230
because my MIDI card is at 330.  That is the default address that
all MIDI software will look for the MIDI card at so I don't want to
change it.  All my other software works find with the SCSI controller
at 230.

Is there a way to tell the kernel to look at the alternate address of
230 for the 1542CF?  I'm using the CD in the "Internet CD" book.
I beleive that release is the 1.2 Slackware release.

I've built the two floppies (Boot, Root) and they work except the
kernel probes never find my SCSI controller or it's devices.

Any ideas?


Thanks,

Mark

Subject: SCSI Problems
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 18:08:21 GMT


   Hi there.  I'm new to linux ('bout three days now) and think it's
FANTASTIC!  I am, however, experiencing a problem.  I have a multimedia kit
installed (ATi Sound Dimension CD) consisting of an ATi Sound FX sound card
and a Mitsumi cdrom.  Linux boots just fine from my boot disk when I pull the sound
card out of it's slot.  But when it's in, say I'm doing something in DOS,
and I decide to go to linux, it won't boot. 
   This is what I get when I boot linux from the boot disk with my soundcard
in place:

   Loading......................................................
   Uncompressing Linux.................
        .
        .

   scsi : 1 host
   scsi0 : warning: SCSI command probably completed successfully before
           abortion  

   
   At this point, the system will just sit there.  I've reconfigured
the board in all possible configurations, as well as selecting different
IRQ combinations for the soundcard and cdrom in the software setup.
   I have also rebuilt the kernel several times, saying no to all of the 
prompts concerning scsi support, cdroms, soundcards and sound support, yet
I still get this if my card is plugged in.
   Some might say just take it out.  As wonderful as I think linux is, I
still use many DOS programs that require my cdrom and soundcard.  It's a 
real pain the have to take the case apart and install the card everytime
I want to use it in DOS!!!!!!

   HELP!!!!!!!!

Please email responses to pmiles@ug.cs.dal.ca
Thanks.

I couldn't get Linux to recognize my 3xi cdrom until I changed the scsi

Unless you use Linux/X over a SLIP or PPP or other modem line into work
to telecommute, like I do... in that case, XFree86 3.1 has LBX support
which will be well worth it once you get it going.

Caveats: LBX is not an official part of X11R6 quite yet, and you'll need
to get the lbxproxy from the X11R6 distribution compiled for whatever
system you're running clients on.

        I've just installed a 4M+ and here's what I learned.  Bootp/tftp will
work, but I had problems getting bootp to work.  My arp cache isn't working
properly, but manually dropping static entries in for the printer fixed that.
Tftp transfers enabled for one subdirectory to send the SNMP config files also
works.  I'm just using lpr/lpd right now, which works fine.  Following the
suggestions above I'm going to look into plp.

        If you look on 'ftp-boi.external.hp.com' (192.6.71.2) you'll find
copies of the JetAdmin software for the Sun and HP (see the license info, but
it's free).  I used the example config files from there as templates for our
setup.
