Subject: xntpd (timed) setup?
Date: 2 Sep 1994 19:33:36 GMT


        I have the xntp package compiled (including xntpd) and a time
server I can access.  However, I'm still having problems; there's
a couple of things not working right.  I have a feeling that I have
it set up.
        How should my /etc/services, /etc/inetd.conf, and xntpd
files be set up?  Any ideas?

        Thanks.

        Of course, if you're storing this tar file on a tape drive,
it might be wise to compress each file individually:  tape drives
have been known to lose a block here and there, and if you lose a
byte 50% into your 100Mb backup tape, gunzip might not have enough
context to continue with the restore.

        Slackware 2.0, Trans-Ameritech distribution, kernel 1.1.18. If 
you don't have a CDU31A installed, then you won't have those files.

        Duh. IF you have a CDU31A drive, and IF you have those files (I 
said previously that if you didn't have those files then you can't use 
this fix), then this is a sure way to fix it. A lot of people have said 
that this worked, and none have told me that it didn't work (yet...)

Since /proc is a virtual filesystem, you can use tar's -l option to
only back up one filesystem at a time.  This keeps the crud in /proc
from getting written to tape.

If you have this version, you do not have the cdu31a.c-* files, only the

Subject: [Q] Why the patch for console.c in FNT01.tar.Z doesn't work ?
Date: 3 Sep 1994 00:07:17 -0500

Hi,

I would like to be able (like proposed) to load different fonts on my VC at
boot time. I read the instructions on how to apply the patch for console in 
my kernel tree but it doesn't work, of course my kernel doesn't compile.

The README file says to apply the patch to:

 /usr/src/linux/kernel/chr_drv/console.c

which seems to me like a (VERY) old kernel tree

instead of my actual:

 /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/console.c

I am wondering if there is a patch that would work with my conf.

Thanks

Offhand, I'd say that "tar * | gzip" would give you a smaller file.
However, if some portion of the resultant file gets corrupted by even a
single bit, all data past that point would be unrecoverable.

"gzip * | tar" would be much safer.

You might look into "afio", too.

No, Mubashir is right. You can use a magic filter which detects what kind of
file you're trying to print and acts accordingly. It says this and gives a 
couple of examples in the Printing HOWTO, but I couldn't get them to work with
my HP DeskJet 520 either, so I too have two different printer names at the 
moment. If anyone can solve this little problem i'd appreciate it.

Subject: Adding Linux to Boot Manager
Date: Sat, 3 Sep 1994 06:26:37 GMT

People have probably asked this for a million times, but I have to ask again
since this is what I am going through now.  

Anyway, my original setup is booting Linux from A: (5.25).  Since OS/2 for
Window comes on 3.5, I swapped my A: and B: around.  I wonder if I can just
add my current Linux partition (on a separate HD) to the Boot Manager, or I
have to boot to Linux and made some changes???

If I have to change anythiny, how and what should I change??

Thanks for your help!!

Nope, not for me at least. I only get error messages in it. talk notices are still placed in the VC.

hi

most probably you have to change a thing or two.

1st add the partition our linux resides on to the boot manager menue.
  (should be clear)
2nd install a bootloader at the partition your linux resides on. assuming
  your fs is ext2 you should use lilo.
  lilosetup is described in readme files and depends a little on your
  distribution.

so you should be done.
a strong recomendation is to stick to this precedence (1st, 2nd).
ugly problems may emerge if your linux is at scsi partition and you
have ide disks present.

i hope i pointed to the right direction and gave the the nessessary
initial information.

hope you succed

Subject: Resolver question
Date: 3 Sep 1994 06:44:51 GMT

Ok, here's an easy one. I'm f*ckin' stumped on this, though. And it's 
really getting to me.

I have NIS (named) running on my machine. My /etc/resolv.conf looks like 
this:

---begin resolv.conf---
# Domain name resolver configuration file

domain  Darkness.Com

# Midnight.Darkness.Com
nameserver 127.0.0.1

# dns2.nmsu.edu
nameserver 128.123.2.19

# dns1.nmsu.edu
nameserver 128.123.3.5
---end resolv.conf---

Now, localhost (127.0.0.1) is running named, so I obviously want this 
activated. But, after that, I'd like to be able to get other hostnames, 
off of my domain. Not a problem. I throw in a couple from NMSU.Edu. Funny 
the resolver never tries anything after the first nameserver. wtf???!!! I 
am a bit confused. I think it's just me trying too hard. The answere MUST 
be so obvious that I'll puke when I see what I missed.

Mail responses. Thanx
