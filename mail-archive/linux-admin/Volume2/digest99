Date: Fri, 23 Sep 1994 10:20:22

Hello..

I'm trying to set up a slip server and I can't seem to get get to the 
outside world. Can Somebody please help?!

Here's what I've done..

Winsock -- modem -- phone -- modem-- linux 1.1.50 -- ethernet----backbone

Winsock = 164.159.2.2
Linux (modem side) 164.159.2.1
Linux (ethernet side) 164.159.1.1
Backbone (164.159.1.0)
Router on backbone 164.159.1.62 (to the rest of the world)
Netmask 255.255.255.192

I'm using dip to set up the server and I have the following entry in the 
diphosts file:

ttyS0::164.159.2.2:164.159.2.1:255.255.255.192:Slip:CSLIP,296

When I dial in, the slip line comes alive and I'm able to ping 164.159.1.1 
which is the host. (Note: the ping time is 465 ms! on a 14.4 modem, this isn't 
right..) I'm NOT able to ping my router at 164.159.1.62.

I've added the arp entry using arp -s 164.159.2.2 {ethernet address} as per 
the FAQ.

I'm not running routed or gated because I thought that adding the arp entry 
would fix the problem. Dip seems to be adding the route to the routing table 
because I see 164.159.2.1 and 164.159.2.2 in the route table.

What am I missing? This seems like a perfect FAQ, but for some reason I'm not 
getting it right. Ideas? Please!

Subject: New version of AUIS available
Date: 24 Sep 1994 09:22:08 -0500

During the Sunsite-troubles, several files from the Andrew User
Interface System distribution were lost.  I have just put up a new
release of AUIS (based on 6.3.1 from CMU).  AUIS is an integrated set of
tools that allow you to create, use, and mail multi-media documents and
apps containing formatted text and embedded objects. AUIS has been
broken into five packages which you may mix in various combinations:

        -wp is aimed at the WORD PROCESSING audience.  All other packges
        require this.
        -src is aimed at the SOURCE CODE DEVELOPER, a programmer writing code 
        -mail is aimed at those needing A BETTER MAIL INTERFACE and
        interested in a MULTI-MEDIA (MIME) MAIL INTERFACE
        -doc contains all AUIS documentation not found in the other packages
        -dev is aimed at those who want to develop their own AUIS
        application. This requires the -src package.

The principle changes are:

-wp (word processing)
        A few fixes
        Default # colors increased to improve look of images
        Can now print documents on A4 paper
        New command, setpapersize
        Improvements in htmltext - WYSWIG editting of HTML docs

    -src (source editting)
        A few fixes

    -mail (multi-media mail user agent)
        A few fixes
        Better instructions on how to get this working

    -doc (the rest of the documentation)
        A few fixes

    -dev (if you want to write your OWN ATK app)
        A few fixes

The following files are currently in pub/Linux/Incoming, but should
eventually be moved to pub/Linux/X11/andrew:

   1384 auis63L2-dev.lsm
3750748 auis63L2-dev.tgz

Subject: URGENT: /dev/cua* problems with mouse and modem
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994 18:28:21 GMT

Hi guys,

Since this weekend I have severe problems with my system.
I tried to install a soundblaster 16ASP using the factory
settings (irq5, irq0 and an unknown irq for the mitsumi
cdrom).

After rebuilding the kernel with sbpcd support and iso9660
I rebooted the system (yes, I reinstalled using lilo).

At the moment I tried to use my modem, some way or other
it looked like I got connected but kermit 5a189 didnot present
any screen output. Looking further I saw my cua0 and cua1 in 
/dev had been changed. For some reason also my mouse does not
work anymore.

I'm using kernel 1.0.9.

I guess I have some IRQ problems. I could only use my harddisk 
again by removing the soundblaster card.


Any help would be greatly appreciated,


Patrick Reijnen

 Ok thats what I do here.I use kermit. WHat I do is this.

call up kermit set the line /dev/cua0 (you can use what ever line)
then set speed 38400
hit c which brings me to the term part then dial the number to the 
remote system. then it ask me for login and passwd. Then it starts it ppp.

I then hit cntrl \ c which brings me back to the kermit prompt. I then 
issue this command.

!nohup pppd /dev/cua0 crtscts -d defaultroute 38400 -detach 

brings the connect right up no problems. There may be a easier way to do 
this but it works for me. Also do you have a ip address assigned to you. 
If not I would ask them to do this.

The reason that there are no examples is that the files in this
directory vary too much from user to user to give examples. The only
file that you need have is the /etc/ppp/options file. This became a
"mandatory option" (if you can call it that) with the 2.1 release. The
2.0 code and before, the 'option' to require it was disabled by
default.

In case you wish to disable it, it is a compile time option in the
pppd process. Look for the REQ_SYSOPTIONS in main.c. Change it to "0"
rather than "1".

The chap-secrets and pap-secrets files are described in the man
page. They are used if you use CHAP or PAP authentication protocols.

The ip-up and ip-down programs/scripts are used only if _you_ wish to
use them. The system does not need them.

"Without reference to the others"? What is "others"? Each file is
independent of the others required to run ppp. There is no
inter-action between them.

[These comments are relative to the setup on the SunOS system]

Easy, but not very secure. It would be better to have one account for
PPP for which all users may use. Do CHAP authentication on the
users. If you have the IP addresses to spare, then subnet the IP
domain and do a network route to the Sun system. Give each user a IP
address. Accept a remote IP address, but fix the local one.

If you don't wish to give each user an IP address, then fix the local
and remote IP addresses. This would mean that they could not receive
mail directly to the remote sysetm, but if you don't have the IP
addresses, then you don't. Something has to give.

In either case the users would then call your system; sign on as the
"ppp" user with the associated password; and the system would run the
ppp software for them.

I always use the slackware 2.0 setup program to do this... All you need

Making a boot floppy is one of the steps.

I recently downloaded the 1.1.45 kernel and un-tared it in my usr/src directory
as the root user (tar -xvf filename) and then type make config which brought
up the script for selecting the options, here are my questions...

1.  Is there anywhere that I can get a detailed description of the choices
    that I can make (what does each selection do...), I would like to know
    if I am making the right choices!.

2.  After I typed make dep and then type make zImage I am left with a file
    called zImage which I copied to a floppy.

*   I rebooted and noticed that I still get a message that says Linux version
    1.1.18 (root@fuzzy), etc.  I know that I can change the MOTD to read
    Welcome to Linux 1.1.45 if I need to but should'nt I be seeing some-
    thing like Linux version 1.1.45 (root@fuzzy), etc.

*   Also how can I test to see if my sound card is working with the support
    that I compiled for it, is there any way to give it a test drive of sorts.

*   If I have successfully compiled the new kernel do I still need the follow-
    ing directories that are located in /usr/src, these are Linux-1.0.9 and
    Linux-1.1.18+UMSDOS-0.3a+IFS-5.1.

It may be complaining about one of the IP's you specified... Without knowing

You have to use "slattach" first.
Try "man slattach".

How?  I read the source when I first heard this long ago, and
couldn't see how this is possible?

This is only partially true. UniBoard _does_ check for time expiration
after each downloaded file (even during batch download) and will disconnect
the user if his time limit is overridden.

Subject: Mosaic & Sound
Date: 20 Sep 1994 07:06:50 GMT

I have Mosaic installed on my computer and I have notice that there are certain
times that you can select an icon to hear sound clips, I beleive that I have 
compiled my kernel correctly for my sound card but when I select the sound icon
I get a message that says spawning external viewer and then the little watch
symbol comes on screen like its doing something but nothing happens after that
point.

Do I need to be doing something different, I have looked at the app-defaults 
and saw nothing that says anything about sound, I really have not researched
this in depth and have possibly overlooked somthing obvious.

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated,

Thanx...

>LPT1 in DOS is /dev/lp0 under Linux.... 

it should be, but my kernel (1.1.33) tells me:

 jope kernel: tty03 at 0x02e8 (irq = 3) is a 16450
 jope kernel: lp_init: lp1 exists, using polling driver
 jope kernel: lp_init: lp2 exists, using polling driver
 jope kernel: Calibrating delay loop.. ok - 3.01 BogoMips

and i can use them as LPT1, LPT2 with DOze. So have a look at Your logfile.
