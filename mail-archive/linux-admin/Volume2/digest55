Hi

I finally got time to make a set of quota patches for 1.1.50. Several people
asked me for these since the current quota patches are against 1.1.21 and
don't install cleanly.

Can anyone tell me where I should upload them? Somewhere in Germany would be
best (due to our internet account).

For me (who has VLB video), the game it about the same speed with or
without sound.  However, if the sound card is not configured properly,
and you leave sndserver in your path, the game crawls.

So, if sound doesn't work for you for any reason, try renaming sndserver
to something else and try again.

I'm running 1.1.49 and when I configured the kernel, it asked if I wanted IP 
Forwarding... I said YES! I did not see any specific 'Gateway' option.

When any host sends Linux a packet, it registers in /proc/dev/net (eth0 or ppp0 
depending on what host sent the packet). However, if the packet is destined for 
the other net, Linux drops it on the floor.

Domain: fone.com = 199.1.142.0 (Class C NetMask = 255.255.255.0)

Router: gateway.fone.com = 199.1.142.254 
                (Linux 1.1.49 NetKit-A-0.06 NetKit-B-0.05)
                (pppd-0.1.4 + chat.???)
        NE2000 ethernet for network 199.1.142.0 (fone.com)
        14.4k V42 modem on 16550 for PPP link

IPGate: tollway.onramp.net = 199.1.11.4 (Annex terminal server)

System boots with Ethernet active, local hosts have full access to Linux.

I manually run the PPP startup, no errors, and Linux has full net access.

PPP command: 
        pppd connect 'chat cmd' /dev/modem 38400 modem debug -am defroute \
                199.1.142.254:199.1.11.4

My 'netstat -r' after PPP link established:

        Destination     Gateway         State   Interface
        loopback        *               U       lo
        fone.com        *               U       eth0
        tollway...      *               UH      ppp0
        default         tollway...      UG      ppp0

I've confirmed '#define CONFIG_IP_FORWARD 1' in ...include/linux/autoconf.h

Any ideas why my packets don't route ???

I'm not to sure about that...I've got a dx2-66 w/ 20 meg of ram and an
ISA tvga 8900 chipset and it runs plenty fine.  No slowness problems at
all...with sound even.  PAS-16.  An AHA-1540b ISA scsi card.  330 meg
seagate (doom is on that one).  Like I said...no problems...

: Ok.  I think 1.1.50 should fix this, although I haven't really tested it
: (I'm still in Australia, so..). Could you check out if that is indeed
: the case?

:               Linus            

I *just* tested the floppy drive with 1.1.50 put on a Slackware 2.0.0
boot disk, and it behaved much better than 1.1.45.  On .45, it would 
not load the root disk to the RAMDISK at all.  With .50, it detected a
disk change after booting the kernel even though the same boot disk
was still there, so I was not prompted to put in the root disk (it
loaded the boot disk there instead!.)  But I got sneaky, and while the
kernel was decompressing/detecting SCSI drives I switched the disks
and I got in just fine.  With 1.0.8 and .9 I  remember it prompting me
to put in the root disk...of course it is past  my bedtime and I am
sleepy to I could be wrong ;-)

Fine.  I would like to verify that my mouse is installed correctly though.
Are there any utilities that support the mouse?  I have not installed any

I have posted a related message previously, so disregard this if you 
answered to previous posting.

I have installed Slackware distribution for Linux 1.0.9.  I have configured
for inbound and outbound slip using the DIP product.  My outbound slip
connection works flawlessly and automatically.  But my inbound connection
required me to issue these three commands before the connection becomes
active:
         ifconfig sl0 farside
         route add farside
         route add inboundhost

farside = my matchine, inboundhost = the dial-in machine desiring slip

It is my impression that DIP should build the routing tables for me.  
However, 'ifconfig sl0' reveals the incorrect ip address, and the routing
tables don't contain any entries other than the loopback entry.

Thanks, Jerry

Sure is, I managed to compile the latest source from UIUC? wherever.  
Anyway, I've got the distribtion in my anonymous FTP directory.  I needed 
to do the following for the compile:
(Notes from 8/7/94 - thb):
1) brought down sources from  boombox.micro.umb.edu

2) extracted them to a directory (duh!) I used /usr/local/src/gopher2.1alpha

3) Edited conf.h
   CLIENT1=your address
   CLIENT2=another address
   AFTP_HOST=your address
   #define DESCRIBE_GOPHER_GRIPE
   #define LOCAL_GRIPE_ADMINISTRATOR

4) Edited Makefile.config

5) make

6) make install

that was easy! :-)

The reason why you don't see it often is because most services or BBS-s you 
call that have 14.4 modems drive it at 19.2 or 38.4; so there is no chance to 
have a throughput higher than that.

I have seen throughput much higher than 56k when I connected two modems of my 
own (115K DTE-DCE rate) and transferred highly compressible stuff.

I am trying to connect a laser printer to the parallel port.
The printer HOWTO file specifies to use /dev/lp1 for this port, but it
doesn't work.  I even tried ls -l > /dev/lp1 and I got the following error.

                            bash: /dev/lp1: No such device

I am running Slackware 1.0 on a 486 DX2-66.  The lpd daemon is
running in the background (it's in the rc.local file).  lpr doesn't
return any errors. Spooling seems to be working, it just seems that
lpd isn't aware of the print files or the parallel port driver isn't
present in the kernel.

Question: Isn't parallel port support available in the Slackware release
kernel?  Not being a Linux guru yet, I dread the possibility of stuffing up
my kernel by attempting to recompile it.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I have installed Linux in a classroom with 16 identical boxes.

Boot from a floopy and type:

Typed from memory but you get the picture.
No need to use fdisk and you can automate the process 
by putting suitable commands in /etc/rc.

If you have ethernetcards in the machines you can 
use ifconfig and paremeterize the name of the machine based
on the MAC-address.

(I use this to keep track of the drift of a particular machine.
