   It's a fairly trivial task to add code to getty_ps to parse the connect
string, and save it in a file for use by a BBS package.  I've done exactly
that for my UNIX system, and the BBS software I wrote.  The BBS can then
reasonably estimate download times, based on the connect speed and an
efficiency factor assigned to each file transfer protocol.

This is what I suspect will be the case as well.

Currently I'm using the "at" command to execute a script that will kill 
all of ther users processes if they're still ogged on after s specific 
amount of time.  This will kill any downloads they are conducting.  I 
plan on displaying a warning before they begin their dow~nload.

I'm making progress slowly but surely.  The message system, gopher 
system, online games, and file system are all in place.  I just have to 
expand on the bare bones setup I currently have.

This is likely a I/O address conflict.  What kind of disk controller are you
using?  What address are the cards jumpered to?  Remember that the NE2000
takes 32 I/O locations.

Are there any Tx or Rx errors reported in /proc/net/dev?  What about error

Linux can't detect what kind of printer you are running, be
it laser or not (how should it - parallel printer interfaces are
unidirectional?).

There is a Linux Printing-HOWTO. Look for Chapter 2.13 (Printer device
names).

No, the destination address must not always be a 'host'. If you make a 'nestat -rn'
for example, you will not find as many 'host' routes as 'network' routes.
'host' routes have the 'H' flag set wheras 'network' routes have the 'G' flag set.
Therefore there could conceptually be a network with number 127.0.0.0. But this
number is per definitionem reserved for local connections on your computer.
I.e the kernel can use the same addressing scheme for local connections (remember
the 'localhost' entry in /etc/hosts), as it would use for external connections.

If you want backup device of that size, you will need to raise your

around for less than $750 US or so. Also, I dont think you can split
a backup across multiple tapes with the current ftape, you need to make
seperate tar files on different tapes.  Kind of a pain but better than
no backup at all.

Type: mailq
It will show you all the mail waiting or defered for shippment.  There seems
to be a very large hole in the smail setup stuff... if you want smtp, then
you will need to doctor some of the files or specify the IP addresses of the
hosts that need and address/MX record as the dist. smail has no support for
bind compiled into it... a major flaw IMHO.

Has anyone else got metamail installed and running on 1.1.50 ?

I was using it before I did the upgrade from 1.1.18 to 1.1.50
and now when I run it, I get an "Oops" from the kernel.  I got

Date: 20 Sep 1994 18:15:16 +1000



hi,

forgive me if this is anewbie & very dumb question.

I run linux 1.1.18 from the InfoMagic Slackware distribution. I am 
connected to the internet via a SLIP line. I am runnign Smail /\==/\ 
Smail3.1.28.1 #28.5 (that's what smail -V prints).

occassionally, well more than occasionally, smail decides its not going 
to deliver the mail. it chucks it into its /var/spool/smail/error dir. I 
have to manually move this mail from there into its input dir.

I can supply my setup files if you want, although they are basically what 
the install/config script setup for me.

hgere is the error messages it prints (to standard output!) when this 
opccurs:


endmail: smcphee@banksia.itd.uts.edu.au ... deferred: (ERR_124) router
 world: path database maps/world, open failed: Connection refused
sendmail: mail moved to /var/spool/smail/error/0qmwVy-000IVXC

Later, when i move the message into the input dir, it sends it ok. i 
don't have to change anything, excpet just moving the mail toi the input dir.

There is a similar error that occurs if the SLIP link is down (of course 
- this wasn't the problem above, as I was telnetted in) - how can i 
modify smail's behaviour so that it merely queues the mail?

i have chacked the linux mail HOWTO which doesn't tell me anything 
(excpet that it should work "out of the box" ;-) ) and the man pages that 
i can find.

any help would be appreciated, even if its a pointer to the FAQ.

thanks, scot.

PS sorry for the typos: i'm in a hurry (i'm late!!) and this telnet link 
is pretty clogged right now so its a bit of a pain to correct spelling 
errors. ;-)

No it reads the exports file on every mount request (just like DEC's).

Nope there is no support for biods to do read-ahead/write-behind's. However
