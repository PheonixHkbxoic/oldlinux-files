Hi all,

I have set my own MANPATH in my .tcshrc file
but if I look to the env settings they are not
there.

So I thougt I will change man.config but it doesn't 
work (e.g. I wanted to include (/usr/TeX/man etc.)!          

Does anyone know where the real System MANPATH is stored
and how I can install a additional private MANPATH!

Subject: c++ problem with Slackware 2.0 distribution
Date: 25 Sep 1994 11:40:53 GMT

Hello,

Perhaps this question would be better off in a gnu group, but since I use the
Slackware distribution:
        I am trying to compile c++ programs, but they seem unable to find or
use the c include files like <stdio.h> and <math.h>. For C everything works fine.
Did I miss some setup things? Or what am I doing wrong? I do have the c++
libraries and include files installed ...

An example of what happens:
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

main(){
  float x;
  x = cos(3.14);
  printf("Hallo");
}


gcc -o test test.cc
/tmp/cca041071.o: Undefined symbol _cos referenced from text segment

Compilation exited abnormally with code 1 at Sun Sep 25 13:40:34


Thanks for any help,
Peter

To save resources.  Without 'exec', the shell will go to 'sleep' and wait
for fvwm to terminate.  The sleeping shell can occupy memory as well as
other resources such as process tables, etc.  'exec' just tells the shell
to die and execute fvwm.  So, the shell process gets replaced by the fvwm 
process, using its process space, etc.

Subject: bind() bug, might have a fix
Date: 25 Sep 1994 12:57:24 GMT

  Whilst testing out my talker code I happened upon a rather nasty bug
in Linux, I certainly hope it isn't meant to be a feature!
  Basically for non-systems ports, ANY user can at ANY time bind() any
port number, if a process already 'owns' the port, even if the process
is owned by root! This means that if you run some sort of server,
someone else can come along and run a program to bind() the port, and
any new connections go to it. With the help of a friend I managed to
track down where the bind() for AF_INET sockets is actually done, and
worked out a fix. It seems to work fine, got it running on test atm.
  The code now allows uid 0 to always grab a port as before, and any
other user to grab non-system (>= 1024) ports if and only if there
isn't a running process that is bound to that port. I'm using the
->dead data member to test if there is an 'alive' process attached to
the port, is this correct?
  I have a diff patch against the sources for 1.1.51, but have been
unable to find who is the best person to send this to for it to be
checked and maybe made official, any offers?

Subject: Repartition linux disk without lose of data
Date: 25 Sep 1994 12:34:17 GMT

I repartioned the disk for the use of Linux as following:

 Disk /dev/hda: 13 heads, 32 sectors, 983 cylinders
 Units = cylinders of 416 * 512 bytes

    Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
 /dev/hda1   *       1       1     394   81936    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M

 /dev/hda3         455     455     983  110032   83  Linux native

In the begining, I had quite few RAM. That is why gave 12MB for swap.
Now I extend the RAM to 12MB and need less swap than before. 

How can I repartion the disk and reduce the size of swap without
loss of data?

Thanks in advance.

There is a package in ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/pub/comp/os/linux/local/network/netboot
called netboot that allows you to boot a PC-Linux based X-Server from the network.
I haven't tried it myself and as far as I know it is beta-ware, but you might like it.

Use the option -r in the mount command, this will mount your CD-Rom
readonly.

>I checked ftab, and etc.., but can't figure it out.

In /etc/ftab you should use the option ro at the end of the line that
mounts the CD-Rom.

There's the problem. Try -sOutputFile=lpr. If you want the output to go
to the stdout, you'll have to use the -dQUIET switch along with 
-sOutputfile= -.

I've just installed a2ps and apsfilter which do much of what you want.
They make it easy to print ps, text that it converts to ps, dvi, and the
output of man converted to ps. You can print single pages to a sheet or
double pages to a sheet, with or without headers.

If you're interested, it's on (amongst other places) ftp.demon.co.uk, under
/pub/linux/distributions/slackware/contrib as aps-23.tgz.

There are a couple of little bugettes with it as it comes out of the box.
One's just a missing command option in the apsfilter script file for single
sided printing. The other is in the a2ps source. It assumes the output from
"man  foo > test" will have the bold characters represented as a
sequence of 3 backspace/character combos when, in fact, it only produces 1
on my setup. Without tweaking, it didn't embolden the output of man.
It's a trivial tweak, so if you decide to go for apsfilter and want to
chase it, let me know. I'll have to get round to mailing the author.

You could, but I would use "tunelp /dev/lp? -i 7" to use the interrupt for
printing again (performance).  B.t.w. as long as you don't print, the
printerinterrupt is free. 
When using a newer kernal, try ' cat /proc/interrupts' when printing and
when not.

You need to read the documentation for the SB16 to find out the IRQ and
base I/O address for the mitsumi.  Don't use the sbpcd support, use the
mcd support.  You'll have to specify the base I/O and IRQ in mcd.h because
the defaults probably won't work because the SoundBlaster will be occupying
the normal mitsumi IRQ.
I have a SB16 + Mitsumi 2x and this is what I had to do.  It works fine.

Hey, David, the system told you -> you have to mount the CD-Drive readonly.

On my system:

My Monitor is the VS15 that came with my Dell XPS P60 - if anyone's got

Assuming that the rest of the networking configuration is proprely
set on your machine, the part of the README.Linux file starting
with these lines:


/* -- begin quote ---*/
CONNECTING TO A PPP SERVER

To use PPP, you invoke the pppd program with appropriate options.
Everything you need to know is contained in the pppd(8) manual page.
However, it's useful to see some examples:

Example 1: A simple dial-up connection.

Here's a command for connecting to a PPP server by modem.

  pppd connect 'chat -v "" ATDT5551212 CONNECT "" ogin: ppp word: whitewater' \
      /dev/cua1 38400 -detach debug crtscts modem defaultroute 192.1.1.17:

Going through pppd's options in order:        
/* -- end quote ---*/

...should be sufficient to get you started.

(The login chat script can also be used to start a command on the
 remote machine, if the remote PPP is not starded as a login shell).

X likes memory (big time).  My box with 8Meg would always be swapping.
If you are using Motif, even worse.  I upgraded to 16Meg and now I 
have speed and no swapping.  If you need X, it is worth the $300 for
the memory

I am successfully using the Tsoft NFS client software. It is available with 
support for several TCP/IP stacks. It can be found at various MS-DOS archive 
sites. A new version was just announced in the comp.protocols.nfs newsgroup.

There is also a package of similar functionality called XFS.

They both work well.
