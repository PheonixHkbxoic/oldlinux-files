Subject: Idle telnet sessions being killed
Date: Sun, 2 Oct 1994 18:10:35 GMT

 
Hi everybody. I just installed gcc-2.5.8, libc-4.5.26 and libg++2.5.31.2.
This made me very tired. But I wanted to do this so that I could upgrade
my kernel. I am now running kernel v1.1.45. I use my Linux box, a 486/33
pc, to connect to a Sun SPARC running SunOS 4.1.2 via ppp 2.1.2a at
both ends. The Sun is on our University network, so it is my gateway
to the Univ network.
Since I did the upgrade, I have noticed that login sessions to remote
machines on the network (actually, telnet sessions) are being logged out
if they are idle for more than a couple of hours. This is a little annoying,
and I never had this kind of experience before. I was running v 1.1.20 of
the kernel previously.
Does anyone know what in this version of the kernel is causing this
anti-social behaviour, and how I can circumvent it? I am not running
the logoutd daemon, nor do I have an /etc/porttime file, but I never
have run logoutd and have never had a /etc/porttime file before either.
I feel maybe there is some process running, though, which is checking
for activity on the ppp link, and logging out users who are idle  for
some time. While the telnet sessions are being killed, though, the ppp
link remains up. Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance. Please reply directly to me by e-mail.
 
Chris Nicol.

I dunno.  But I had a whole 540Mb compressed with Stacker 4.0 .  When
I try to shrink it, I discovered that the Stacker uncompressing
routine can't handle that much data!  What a crook of Messy Dos.

I use "g3topbm < fax.g3 | pnmtops -dpi 240 -noturn | gs ...."
If I don't use -noturn, then the image is turned 90 degrees and printed
on its side. Resized to about a quarter of its original size, of course.
I print my faxes on an Epson-compatible 9-pin matrix printer, for the
time being. No money yet to buy a decent laserprinter.  :-(

By the way: Faxes that are sent to me using the 'fine' mode print
out just about perfect, while 'normal' faxes look very compressed.

I (still) use mgetty*sendfax 0.18 with a ZyXEL U1496E+ modem.
Thanks gert, for this great package!

Subject: SLIP idle statistics?
Date: 2 Oct 1994 19:02:23 GMT

I'm looking for a way to detect SLIP connection idle times.  I'm
connecting my machine to an on-campus SLIP server, for access in
both directions.  Since others will be using the connection from
the outside, I won't necessarily be sitting in front of the machine
to terminate the connection when not needed.

In essence, I'm looking for a way for a cron job to find out how long
the SLIP connection has been idle, then cycle it if required.

Any ideas, hacks, etc?

You can also use Apple File Exchange.  Its not a convenient but it comes 
with system 7 at no additional charge. (It deosn't mount the DOS disk, 
but allows you to copy files off it and onto it from the mac.)

Alternately, I use ACCESS PC (does basicly the same thing as dos 
mounter) so there are many choices to accomplish this task.

        Look in your /etc/inittab.  At the very top is a way to set
your default runlevel.  If you haven't modified this file extensively
(and you haven't) runlevel 6 is for an windows only (almost) system.
Change the line that is commented about the default rulevel.
        Next, at the bottom of this file you will see what recource
file is run for the Xwindows runlevel.  This is PROBABLY
/etc/rc.d/rc.6, for runlevel 6.  If you look at this file, you will
see that it runs xdm (xwindows display manager). This is the daemon
that restarts you Xserver and prompts each user for a login.
        Finally `man xdm`. Read the FAQ, too.

   In a response to a post about Pentiums, I noticed someone mentioned
a gcc optimized for Pentiums. Is this GCC 2.6.0? It is the most current
version I have been able to find (new as of July) and its README does
not include i586 as an optimized processor.
   Am I missing the boat? Does this exist someplace else or do I already
have it? The implications are huge. My box would be *that* much faster,

Subject: PCI vs. VLB
From: riku.saikkonen@compart.fi (Riku Saikkonen)

Which system would be better to use for Linux (+X), a VLB motherboard
with a VLB display adapter, I/O card, and whatever, or a PCI system?

I've heard that PCI would be somewhat faster; how much? Also, I've heard
that PCI isn't too stable yet, some cards won't work together; is this
right?

Does the kernel support VLB or PCI IDE host adapters? Are they much
faster than ISA ones?

A common PCI display adapter seems to be an 'AvanceLogic' (I don't know
of a model) card. Does XFree86 2.1.1 support this? Which chipset does it
have? Would I be better off with a Cirrus? (Which is better, a 5428 or a
5434?)

Does the kernel support the NCR SCSI-2 controller that is integrated in
some PCI motherboards? I found some NCR PCI drivers in drivers/scsi; do
they work with the integrated chip (unfortunately I've forgotten the
chip model number)?

Which is the fastest, a double-speed SCSI CD-ROM with an ISA host
adapter, the same with PCI/VLB (does it make a difference with something
as slow as a CD-ROM?), or a double-speed Sony interface CD-ROM?

        Well Andreas,

it `should' do so, but for me it didn't--at least not pretty nice. I
got apsfilter-4.8 from ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de and installed in
in /usr/lib/apsfilter, following the installation instructions. I
expected the package to run from scratch, as the further versions (up
to now I used V2.3) did, but I was dissapointed.

First I recognized, that the file permissions didn't allow any other
user except of root, to access any of the files in the apsfilter
directory. After changing the permissions I wondered about search path
settings, which didn't match my system setup. I had to change the file
GLOBAL.SH to meet my needs. What about using the user's PATH?

After these changes, apsfilter seems to work 'pretty well' ....

Date: 2 Oct 1994 20:16:31 GMT

Hi

We have been having a very serious problem with our Linux boxes.  The 
problem, when it happens, jams our local network.  The % network traffic
goes through the roof.
The problem happens happens every time someone tries to ghostview any of
the postscript files on our nfs server.  Ghostview is not the problem,
because this happens sometimes when nobody is on the machine.
I think there is a problem with one of the many daemons (nfsd,mountd,ypbind,
etc..).  Don't ask me which though.

We are using Slakware 2.0, and all that implies.  I tried that fix for 
the portmapper, ie the fix to libc 4.5.26, but it didn't seem to help.

Any help would by appreciated.

Thanks...

And what about those of us that DON'T see it?  Basic setup is a
dedicated PPP link on a 14.4 dialup, NET-3 stuff, ppd 2.1.2a,
etc., with an InfoMagic/TransAmeritech CD-ROM combined install.

I move many megabytes of files around via FTP daily, and another
many megs around with mosaic and lynx.  Sendmail+IDA's been
rock-solid.

The AMPR code is still beta-stuff, I think.  Do you really need it?
Also, are your users using ncftp or 'stock' ftp?  Aside from the X25
stuff in your kernel, and the fact your dialin users are seeing/causing
this, there probably isn't much difference in the way we do things.
I have no dialup users.  So, if that's any help, there might be 
something in the way your getty handles buffering (if there is
such as thing); I use agetty.

   install it, follow the instructions. It will work wonders for you :)

I got apsfilter (see comp.linux.announce for a recent upgrade) and,
while it now works like a charm, I'd caution anyone using it to be
VERY warry of the printcap entries it sticks in your /etc/printcap
file.  I spent an entire day to find the following out:

apsfilter installation puts printcap entries of the form:

lp|lp2|deskjet-letter-auto-mono|deskjet auto mono:\
        :lp=/dev/lp1:\
        :sd=/usr/spool/deskjet:\
        :lf=/usr/spool/deskjet/log:\
        :af=/usr/spool/deskjet/acct:\
        :if=/usr/local/lib/apsfilter/filter/aps-deskjet-letter-auto-mono:\
        :mx#0:\
        :sh:

Into your /etc/printcap.  The entry looked EXACTLY like the above
entry but failed to work on my system (a page with a dribble of
nonsense always printed before the real thing).

Solution: Eliminate all the whitespace and continuation characters (\)
in the entry, and then re-format it yourself, with tabs beginning each
line and no spaces after the continuation slashes.

This solved the problem for me anyway.  I hope my hours of frustration
helps someone else.

But that causes problems.  One of which (the only one I really care about) is
the login sequence gets screwed up:

jgotts.ccs.itd.umich.edu login:

instead of:

jgotts login:

My solution for this was to use the new hostname program and the old domain-
name program in my /etc/rc.d/rc.M:

/bin/hostname jgotts
/bin/domainname.old ccs.itd.umich.edu

This should resolve one of the most recently asked questions around here
(besides "How do I configure my X server?" and a few others).

I'm having trouble with tar.  When I try to us it, all I get is:

tar: can't open /dev/rmt0 : No such device or address

Why does it say this?  I looked for /dev/rmt0 and it's there.
Thanks.
