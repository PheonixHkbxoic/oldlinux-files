There are base programs for UL/DL protcols for x, y and z modem.  They 
are command line driven.  Using curses you could probobly write your own 
nice looking front end that could launch them...

        Something strange happened to my MFM when I swapped MB's and suddenly
I couldn't delete anything, "del", "chkdsk" , "format" and "fdisk" all didn't
work, nothing could touch the HD.  Even Norton's disk doctor could do anything.
Solution, use Linux's "FDISK" to delete all the partitions.  After that, Dos
"fdisk" worked just fine.  I don't have a clue why????

There are different postgres packages around, and some miss the most
important docs.  Try getting the newest postgres version from:

    s2k-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/pub/postgres/unofficial-ports/linux/newbie*.tar.gz

These contain about 1 Megabyte in the docs subdir.

Heh.  I got the same error a few weeks back.  I had told the
configure script I didn't want ppp/slip support.  At the time, I
didn't.  It wouldn't ld.

Decided to try again today.  This time I told the configure script
I wanted ppp/slip support.  I did, this time.  It worked fine.

So far, so good.

Relax guy, there is already serious work afoot to get seperate DOOM 
catagories for thsi over in rec.games.  When they are ready, we can send 
all the doom-ies over there.  Meanwhile, might i suggest you use a

From the Sound HOW TO by Jeff Tranter

  An alternate sound driver is available that requires no additional
  sound hardware; it uses the internal PC speaker. It is mostly software
  compatible with the sound card driver, but, as might be expected,
  provides much lower quality output and has much more CPU overhead. The
  results seem to vary, being dependent on the characteristics of the
  individual loudspeaker. For more information, see the documentation
  provided with the release.

  The current version is 0.6, and can be found at site sunsite.unc.edu
  in the file pub/Linux/kernel/misc-patches/pcsndrv-0.6.tar.z.

For a little more information look at chapter 5 of the Linux Sound User's
Guide also by Tranter.The current version is ALPHA 0.1, and is available on
tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory /pub/linux/ALPHA/LDP.

I know about a program that can merge two (primary dos) partitions,
in wich the data on the first is conserved. (Called FIPS, source:FTP)

But i don't know a program that can do merge/split/move/etc partitions 
in general.
As a matter of fact, i don't know wether a Linux-partition uses any specific
partition information, like cilinders etc. for it's file system.
If so, nothing's possible.
I know for a DOS-partition that it -should-  be possible to these things.

I'm sorry, i think there's no alternative...

If you aren't running the lp driver which uses the IRQ for interupts, then
yes, you can use IRQs 5 and 7 for whatever you want.  (I have both lp1 and lp2
ports in my machine at home, and I use IRQ 5 for my ethernet card.  Then again
I have nothing connected to lp2 right now either.)

DOS doesn't use IRQs by default for either serial or parallel ports.
Some DOS software may.  You have to know.  I'm not sure about windows.

Gack!  What an over-simplified, over generalized statement!  /dev/lp1
is for the printer attached to the parallel port with address 0x378.  Some
people have a parallel port with address 0x3BC, and it's /dev/lp0.  Others
may have a parallel port with address 0x278, and it's /dev/lp2.  IT HAS 
(almost) NOTHING TO DO WITH DOS DEVICE NAMES! (see my previous posting
on the subject.)  AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT THE PRINTER
IS A LASER PRINTER OR NOT!  For crying out loud, there are serial laser
printers out there too, which means they could very well be connected
to some /dev/ttyxx (or /dev/cuax).

It depends.  Who is publishing your MX records, and what do they say?
Usually your service provider will publish your records, and will point
them to one of there machines, which will hold on to your mail for 1, 3, or 7
days (or whatever they have configured, and probably negotiable to something
you want).

If you are publishing your own MX records, then you are definitely doing
something wrong.  When your machine is down, you have no MX records, and
nobody knows how to route mail to you, or they will use old, possibly
VERY old (by their standards) stale MX records in the hopes that they
will still work.  If some site (like your Internet provider) is not willing
to act as a store and forward site for you, then yes, mail will bounce
when you are not up.

Talk to your Internet provider.  They may charge extra.  Then again, they may
not.

How are you adding it?  Certain that you're using setenv rather
than just set?  Not putting an equal sign in the line are you?

The following should work:

setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH :/usr/TeX/man"

Well, on my Slackware 2.0 system, it's set in /etc/csh.login.

Of course, this means that one has to maintain separate copies
for csh  and  profile (for those bash users).  IMO, a better
solution would be to create a MANPATH file, and have the
appropriate start up shell extract the info from it.  That way
only one file needs to be updated.

Hope this helps.

Subject: lockup after VFS mount - help!
Date: 25 Sep 1994 16:55:03 -0400

I am attempting to install the Fall '94 release of Y's Plug & Play linux. 
Hardware listed below - all are recognized and check out ok.  The boot
runs all the way through the "VFS: Mounted root (iso9600 filesystem)
readonly." then just sits there (and sits there, and sits there)...  I
can't even get to the login prompt to continue installation!  Any
comments/suggestions gratefully received.

**** Hardware setup ****
Gateway 2000 4DX2-50V
Mitsumi CD-ROM w/SB "compatible" card
405MB IDE hard drive, partitioned into hda1 & hda2
8MB RAM

   I have noticed the same thing-- I need to set the time with my BIOS
   config program.  Setting it through Linux always gets it reset after
   a reboot.

        I've seen the same problem, and I've also seen my clock wander
frequently.  Not suprisingly, the clocks in PC-COmpatibles aren't very
stable.  If you run "netdate" froma cron job every day or so, your
clock should remain accurate to within a second.  If it isn't that
accurate, you may have power supply problems or something else weird.
