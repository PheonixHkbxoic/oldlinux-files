I don't know - but may be it has something to do with files the /ftp/lib

The version of cron that comes with slackware does not support other shells

You should know the facts before posting "stupid" flames. The "4" has
nothing to do with the clock-tripling but with the performace compared
to a normal 486.
And you should have said: AMD will "copy" another chip from Intel. :-)

Yes, since there are tolerances in the production of chips they can actually
test if the chip runs with 40MHz internally. If they want to sell it as a
Dx/2 80, they are going to check that it runs with at least 90Mhz or so, which
means if you overclock an DX2/66 it might run with 80 (it almost always will),
but it doesn't have to, and your range of tolerance is pretty small.

It IS possible without modifying ppp. I run ppp from my linux-box at home
over a telnet-session and a pppd on a sparc. It works fine but you have
additional latency over the internet-link.

On the sparc I start ppp with:

pppd passive proxyarp asyncmap 200a0000 mru 296 remotename my.bix.at.home

and similar on linux. I use chap to authenticate and a simple kermit

This is normal for Intel EtherExpress users.  Changing / upgrading kernel 
won't help unless there is a newer version eexpress.c.  As of now, I don't 
know if there is a newer version or if there will be one in the future.  
Donald Becker (the author of this driver) told me something about the design 
of EtherExpress that causes it to behave like that.

I ended up switching to a Novell NE2000 and it has been solid ever since.

That's possibly not a good idea if /tmp is a mount-point because it trashes
lost+found too, which you may want to keep.

It also will not de-allocate the directory entries for deleted files (some
file-systems might do this, but I'm not sure which).

The way I usually clean up temporary areas which are not mount-points is
to completely remove and re-create the whole directory.

From the little I know I'd say the problem with answerbook is that it
needs Display Postscript in your X server. The standard 2.11 server
from XFree86 does not have this. Theoretically that means it should
work with XFree86 3.1 (which has DPS), however I wouldn't bet on it.
Answerbook is very persnickety. I can run it on the console of my
Sparc 20 while running the openlook window manager (olwm) but not
fvwm.

More than likely it is the same problem with imagetool, but I'm
not sure.

Undelete in all generality is called 'restoring from a backup', so you might
talk to your backup medium. Several good backupprocedures exist, e.g.
backup-X.YY.tar.gz at ftp.icce.rug.nl /pub/unix (by Karel Kubat).

Apart from that, I sometimes use an icmake-script: am for 'attic move'
that stores files I'm not sure I want completely gone in an archive on disk.

Every once in a while I 'clean up the attic' removing from it the
files I'm sure I can do without. If I remember well am is in the examples of
the icmake distribution (at sunsite, tsx, or ftp.icce.rug.nl, /pub/unix)
(otherwise I'll put it on our ftp-site on request).

Apart from that, no undelete/unerase exist.

Good Luck.
