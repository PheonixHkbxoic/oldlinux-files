You are wise to be conserned. Anyone can hack your account at this
point with the command:

  rlogin -l acg remotehost

Obviously, this is the incorrect behavior, since "rsh" and "rlogin"
should be SUID=root.  So I just corrected this bug, and uploaded the
fix as term-2.1.2.tar.gz.  So now you will find any user can do

  rlogin localhost

but only root, and you can do:

  rlogin -l acg remotehost

I had a peculiar problem with one Linux box I used. It would stay up for
ages with any problems.  But occasionally, I used to build up a static
charge on my clothes.  When this discharged into the desk (not electrically
attached to the computer), the keyboard would immediately freeze, and the
machine would have to be rebooted.  It only happened occasionally.  But just
enough to worry about frying the internals.

It never happened with DOS.

The easiest way is to ask your provider to create a normal user account on his
internet box for you. You should name this user the same as on your local box, so when replying to usenet messages the right user@domain is given as reply address. To read your mail you simply telnet to this user, login and call your favourite mail reader (you read your mail remotely and online this way, if you don't want that, perhaps because you were on vacation and millions of msgs have arrived, you can also copy the mail-directory via ftp to your machine). You can write mail on your own machine via slip or remotely, the latter has the advantage that you have only one mail directory.

You should also check that your domain name is right on your local box (just call "domainname"), it should be that of your provider.

Subject: floppy problems on Linux 1.1.51
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 09:03:42 GMT

Hi,

Recently installed Linux 1.1.51. However, when I mount a DOS floppy
and try to unmount it when finished, in about 50 % of the cases the
unmount command crashes with a Segmentation Fault and exits.
This leaves an /etc/mtab~ hanging around and corrupts the filesystem
information:

'df' then yields an entry for /fd0 (my floppydrive) with the statistics
of my Linux partition.

A second mount and unmount (after removing the /etc/mtab~) often fixes 
the problem.

Anyone who experienced the same or anyone who knows how to avoid this ?

Thanks in advance.

I had a similar problem with talk, except that mine said "couldn't attach to

Putting an entry in /etc/hosts for your own machine (not localhost) fixed it

Err.., my Mosaic runs without any Motif (shouldn't it ?). OK, i don't have BUILD
it from the sources. I got the compiled stuff from a ftp-server in Germany
(ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de) and it works like a champ. But since this is a 
mirror of server(s) in the US, this stuff should be available for you on a server 
nearby (sunsite ?). If MOTIF is necessary to build Mosaic, it isn't to run it.

Subject: ETHER 16+
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 01:01:28 GMT

Hi there!

I recently bought me a used Ethernet card to connect my two linux boxes. 
But I didn't get any driver (yet) to go with it (Kernel 1.0.9) :-(

Maybe someone else can help, because unfortunately I do not have
any further docs or config software.

Here is some stuff about the card:

It is a 16 Bit ISA card.
Printed on it: "ETHER 16+ REV-B". It has Cheapernet (BNC) and Tranceiver
(15 pin D-Sub Female) outputs.
One big ASIC with "DL3516A" (big) and "F25D 119" (small) on it, 
one 24 Pin DIL with "B9218" and "DP83910AN" on it, 
one 20 Pin DIL with "DE-200+ 01" and "A1134-00-1BS 9229",
one 16 Pin DIL with "B9224" and "DP8392CN" on it.
Two 5864 RAM (I guess they make up 16 kBYte RAM)
an (empty) BOOT-ROM Socket (28 Pin)

Jumper:
JP3: IRQ for 3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,15
JP6: labeled "I/O", numbered from 1 to 5, I assume them
     being Address lines A5-A9
JP5: labeled "MEM", numbered from 1 to 3,
     they seem to set buffer and/or boot rom address ???

I tested it with a Cx486DX40 Board, having the I/O-jumper
set to 0x300 (which is free in my system) and drivers see that
there is something but don't recognize. IRQ was set IRQ 10,
having ETH0_IRQ set to 10 in the CONFIG-File in drivers/net.


Thanks in advance
Andre

: George

Actually, MS-DOS uses a seek sequence to set up lpt devices.  It searches in
the same order as linux for lpt devices, but the first one found is put at
lpt1, the second at lpt2, etc.  You will never see a DOS machine that has
an lpt2 but not an lpt1.  Linux, on the otherhand, uses a table to identify
lpt ports.  If the first port isn't found, then lp0 will not exist, regardless
of whether or not other lp devices do exist.  It is quite possible then that
lpt1 under does can be the same as lp2 under linux if the only parallel port
is installed at 0x278.  What device a certain lpx port is connected to
depends entirely on which cable is plugged into which piece of hardware.
With multiple lp devices it may take some experimentation to find out which
device is connected to what.  So, to answer the original question, the HOWTO
may say that the printer *should* be connected to lp1, which for the most part
is correct because 90%+ of all parallel ports installed in systems use the
address of device lp1, but it also *may* be connected to another lp device.
As I sais, experimentation sounds like it is in order here.  One easy way to
tell is to check /var/adm/messages after a boot and look for a line that
says something like "lpx exists: using polling driver".  This will tell you
what lp device you have, if indeed any is found, which depends on the lp
device driver being configured into the kernel.

XBBS does get the connect speed from the termio structure and uses it to
determine the length of time required to download a particular file.
After saying this, there is still a problem with the technique. On my
lines that are connected to my 28.8K modems, the computer baud rate is 
always 38.4K baud! Therefore, whenever a user logs in on one of those
lines, the computer thinks, reguardless of the actual modem connection
speed, that the caller is calling in at 38.4K. 
 
Each port has a log file associated with it called callers.bbsxx, where
xx is the last two characters of the port id. In this file ( or files )
the calling baud rate is logged for the sysop. Unfortunately, on lines 
that are fixed at a particular baud rate, such as 38.4K, it will always
show the fixed baud rate since that is what the computer thinks the connection
is at.

Are there any commonly used backup scripts in the Linux community?

I've looked at the FAQs, HOWTOs, comp.os.linux.* newsgroups, Ftape

the System Admin Guide) from sunsite.unc.edu.  

I haven't been able to find info about commonly used backup scripts

'tar/gnutar' or 'cpio' (has anyone ported BSD 'dump' to Linux?).

Subject: Need Hel p with fixing possible ATI Mach 32 X server
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994 22:17:40 GMT

I have a question relating to ATI graphics cards, and I hope some one
can help me.

I've read some where that there exists some problems with ATI cards.  I 
have recently installed Linux on my PC but I have much knowledge about UNIX.
But I have a question regarding the the XF86_Mach32 server.

I got X windows running; that is, I do get the blue screen and the three
pop menus.  I can use X applications and shells, but the problem is exiting
X windows.

When I wish to exit and select the exit windows option, the blue screen 
background sure disappears, but I never get the black text mode I started
X windows from.  Instead, the blue screen background which size is the entire
monitor's display then changed to a green flickering screen which size is
around half the display and in the center of the display with a border of 
black.  And I never return to the text mode with a shell prompt such as
csh or sh.  

This problem also occurs when I try to switch to a virtual console using
the CTRL-ALT-F(1...) key sequences, and again I get the some problem, a 
display with a flickering rectangle centered around the middle of the
display with a black border.

I've tried some utilities in the svgalib package from ftp:sunsite -- 
savetextmode and restoretext, but I have no success there since the problem
stated above was still existing.  No matter what window manager I use, mwm, 
fvwm, or olwm, I still have problem exiting X-windows in that the X server
never shuts down.  According to the error I have got from starting X with
'startx', the error messages indicate that the X server is slow in shutting 
down.  Why is that?  Is the green screen an intermediary step before returning
to the text mode?  Just wondering...  For me to exit, I have to dreadfully
use CTRL-ALT-DEL to reboot and return to a text mode display.  

I've included my Xconfig file, and I have a 486DX2-66 AST Advantage Plus
PC.  It has an AST local bus and the ATI graphic chipset 68000 is integrated
on the motherboard itself; that is, the ATI chipset is not an add-in board.
My monitor is a Panasonic C1795E (PanaSync) 17" monitor which also conforms
to VESA monitor signaling.  I am using XFree86 2.1 or 2.1.1.

Another Linux user told me to try to use XF86_Mach32 2.0 server but it didn't
work.

Seriously, is the ATI mach 32 X server pretty stable and compatible?  Or I 
haven't fine tune my video modes?  

I hope you can lead me to try to find an answer, and I appreciate any help.
Thank you very much.
