   csmith@convex.com (I think) wrote HPFS for linux. When I asked him
   he pointed out that write access to HPFS is a very difficult thing
   when you want to do it right (fragmentation, performance ...), and
   he didn't know if he would have the time to figure out how OS/2
   does it, because IBM didn't release any information about HPFS -
   the only official document that exists by now is the some years old
   one by Microsoft.  I think it helps us much more if someone
   continues the work on ext2fs for OS/2.

I will try writing HPFS at some point, but as you say it's much harder.
Especially if the system crashes -- Linux does not normally write
everything out in a way that leaves the disk consistent at all times.
Linux fsck can live with this, it's not clear that OS/2 CHKDSK can,
especially given the way HPFS directories work.  But we shall see.

This is a great idea, IMHO. But it is only useful if there is more than one

This is actually a problem, because most (if not all) today's modems have
large internal buffers that will drain the whole banner instantaneously...

Use the orignal boot disk you used to setup linux.  Then mount the root
partition.  Since that disk has a blank password for the system,
you should be able to access the password file and delete the password
and try again.

I have a lot of keyboard problems wit pre53_19, too,
but I don't think it's the modmap, because the
problems are allways different.
Capslock doesn't work on one machine, but works fine on another one.

TYpically UNIX mv does not work across volumes.  I'm suprised it doesnt 
error out on you.  The standard way to move things across volumes is to 
use tar to copy it, and then rm -r the original.

on Linux by Pascal Cleve@tiac.net

The NCSA distribution compiles cleanly on Linux and then you just have
to follow the directions in the docs (you can either get and install the
doc html pages or just view them at NCSA via Mosaic or whatnot) to set
up the config files.

The setup was more or less a piece of cake although I still have a
question:  how to set up the directory, etc permissions such that when
my Linux box is accessed via Mosaic without calling a specific page, it
would go straight to the default page as opposed to attempting to list
the directory and THEN displaying the page below (if I restrict access
to all files there's still lines left indicating that directory is being
read but its empty as far as httpd is concerned).

Any clues appreciated.

PS. To the original poster, if you have any specific questions about the
installation, drop me a note.

Hi there folks,

I've got a major problem trying to network a couple of my machines.  Basically,
I use machine A to dial into SLIP and connect me to the net.  Machine B is
connected to machine A via PLIP, which works just fine.  Machine A can see
hosts on the Internet and can telnet anywhere.  Machine B can only see
Machine A, and nothing else.  I want to set it up so I can telnet out from
either Machine B or Machine A, by using Machine A as a router or gateway to
the net.  ANY help would be greatly appreciated.

Depends on what "man" you have. For definite (I use it) man-1.4b lets you
