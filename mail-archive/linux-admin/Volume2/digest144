Better yet, I use suntar 2.0, a macintosh freeware that reads and writes unix tar format.
This way you could tar up all the text right to the floppy on the mac and untar it on the
Linux box. No need to go through an intermediate PC format. 

You can get suntar 2.0 from usual mac archive sites.

I've been running an FTAPE since Bas took over maintaining it.
It's worked for me since then (386DX-25, Linux 0.99p12 or so).

I did it between 0.99p12, 0.99p15, and 1.0.0 (which I've been running
for the better part of the last year).  If you can remeber EVERYTHING
you've done in the last year, you have a better memory than me!

The perhaps you should have assigned it an "unreasonable" number?   B^)

I seem to remember that early version of the audio driver had some context
switching problems.  If I tried that under X-windows, output came out in
"chunks" with spaces between them.  If I left X and tried it again under
straight Linux, it came out better (but on my PC speaker, the quality
was terrible, but recognizable).  Since the documentation said the quality would
be terrible on my PC speaker, I didn't worry about it.  I've never had the time
(or disk space to go back for a more up-to-date version, sorry.  So I can't tell
you when (or if) they've fixed that problem.  One of these days I'll be buying a
SoundBlaster-16-ASP.  I'll probably retry it again then.

Yes, change the protocol you are using.  "G" protocol is limited to 64 byte
packets, but someone wrote up a "g" protocol which supports larger packet
sizes (or do I have them backwards?).  BOTH ends of your UUCP connection must
support it.  Login to your UUCP host by hand and check out the protocols it allows.
Or increase your debugging output for one call and look in the log files for it.
Then get some documentation on UUCP that describes the various protocols, and see
what your options are.  (You could always get a faster modem, but that is probably
not a useful answer B^).

libXpm-3.4c _seemed_ to compile fine under XFree86 3.1, but any apps 
linked with the resulting shared library seg fault when executed.  The 
static version of libXpm works, though.  (Mitch - are you planning to

If you have a card that is supported for 16bpp oar 32bpp and enough
video-memory, then go for it! (I have a cheap cirrus 5428-card and 1M of
memory on it, so I can only have 800x600 resolution with 16bit colour,
but I use it anyway)

And the doom-mode is good too :)

But if your card is not one of the supported cards or if you are not
interested in TruoColor, etc. and use X mainly for xterms, stick with
2.11.

You're out of luck. No one has been successful in getting enough information
from HP (or really any other flatbed scanner manufacturer except for maybe
EPSON) to develop a scanner driver. Take a read of the Scanner Info Sheet
below.

BAJ

===============================================================================
LINUX SCANNER INFO SHEET (Last updated October 1, 1994)

[This is an editorial comment. I'll have a scattering of these in the document.
These are my own personal comments - BAJ ]

1.0 INTRODUCTION
================
Scanner drivers for Linux seem to be few and far between. In addition
documentation for the software is non existant. This document attemps to 
describe the available information about scanners for Linux and propose some 
directions for future development.

The current editor of this document is Byron A. Jeff. I can be reached at
byron@cc.gatech.edu.

1.1 The misconception of TWAIN compliancy
=========================================
One of the comments I often see is "If we write a TWAIN driver then all
scanners will work..." Unfortunately this is an incorrect assertion. TWAIN
is a standard that the scanner manufacurers came up with to provide a
common, standard interface between their scanners and the DOS/Windows
applications that use them. Quick Picture:

###################-----------------------------------------
# DOS/WINDOWS APP #
# PhotoShop or    # This is the application. it can function
# PhotoStylers or # with different manufacturers scanners
# OCR.            # because of the TWAIN interface on the
#-----------------# bottom edge.
# TWAIN interface #
# Application     #
# Side            #
###################-----------------------------------------
# TWAIN interface # This is the software driver that comes
# Driver Side     # with the scanner. It has a TWAIN interface
#-----------------# on the top end so that it can mate with
# Hardware Driver # different applications. Each hardware driver is different.
###################-----------------------------------------
# Scanner Card    #
################### This is the scanner hardware.
#    Scanner      #
###################

The problem for us Linux folks is twofold:

1) We really don't have any DOS/Windows applications we can run. 
2) For each scanner a different Hardware Driver must be written
   and the hard specifications for that scanner must be available to
   accomplish this task.
  
So TWAIN doesn't buy us anything in terms of getting a single driver to
run all scanners.

Anyway TWAIN is just a hack that the Unix/Linux driver interface already
solves. So there's no joy here.

2.0 CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
=============================
[ Instead of writing about currently available stuff I'll just put the
post where I've seen it. If anyone has updated information, let me know.]

3.0 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT

[Again for now I'll just copy the posts I've seen. This is primarily Dr.
G.W. Wettstein's work. He posted something recently about continuing 
development on SCSI scanners. Hope to see something concrete soon.

Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.development
Subject: Re: Scaner ?

I am embroiled in the middle of such a project right now.  My current
work is to develop an image processing/storage system for our corporate
Linux network.  I vended a Fujitsu scanner for this project and it is
sitting at home right now, connected to my Linux box there.

The Fujitsu scanner conforms to the SCSI-2 standard for scanners.  I
bought the technical documentation for it and it too is sitting at
home.  I currently have the basics of a driver for it built on top
of 0.99.13.  The driver currently only implements some selected ioctl's
and the basic framework for read etc.  It is not currently capable
of really scanning a document.  Finishing this is on an absolutely
high priority so the next month or so should bring this to fruition.

I would like to donate the driver back to the Linus for inclusion into
the official kernel sources.  I do not know how much appetite there is
for this type of thing but rumor has it that scanners are not well
supported (at least SCSI-2) in the desktop UNIX market.  Perhaps Linux
can be a leader there as well.

I am not sure what type of interface that the HP machine uses.  We
considered vending one of their scanners but the technical support people
were a little bit baucky about giving out interface and programming
details.  We chose the Fujitsu because it was one of the few that
seemed to support SCSI-2.

I will let everyone know when the driver is capable of doing things more
intelligent that it does now.  I would be interested in hearing from
other's who have similar interests or projects in progress.  E-mail
to the address in my .sig is probably preferable to referring to the

4.0 POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

4.1 Epson Scanners
[ OK this is my own personal baby. I don't have time to work on it now.
  with the permission of the author and a hookup with me maybe someone
  else can pick up the ball. ]

Terry Gliedt has written a scanner driver for the Epson series of scanners.
While the code is specifically targeted for the 300C it'll likely work
with the other models (600C and 800C). But more importantly Epson has the 
programming specs for the devices available. Here is the info:

References:
  "Epson Color-Monochrome Image Scanners ES-300C Programmers Guide"
  (X-ES300C-P) available from Epson at 1-800-922-8911 for $7.50.

I have the code. It was written for the NeXT. I'm not sure about distribution
and one of the copyrights specifically states that it can't be modified
without the consent of the author. 

However if it can be ported then we'll have another class of pretty good 
scanners to work with.

[Update: One day I finally got around to playing with it. The code compiled
         with a little massaging. But of course it's looking for the 
         underlaying driver. I still have plans to purchase a 600C and write
         the driver but it'll be fall at the earilest. ]

4.2 Desperate? Internetworking with DOS machines.
=======================================

Another faster way of getting a scanner working is to use the scanner software
in the native DOS environment and then transfer images to the Linux box.
For example I have access to a BJ10 color scanner/printer that I can't
even explain what I want to do to their tech folks much less get technical 
specs.  However they do have a test program than scans in an image. It is 
involked from the DOS command line. So a possible scenario might be:

1) Drop the scanner and ethernet card in a second machine running DOS.
2) Get a copy of Wattcp and NFS along with a packet driver and PKTMUX. 
   These are all freeware/shareware products available via ftp.
3) Set up the DOS box with the software so that you can mount Linux directories
   and so that the Linux box can telnet to the Linux box (using telnetd, a 
   program in the Wattcp package on the DOS box.)
4) Ok. Now the linux box can send commands to the dos box using telnet.
   The linux box tells the dos box to do a scan. The destination for
   the scan file will be a file on the NFS drive. So once the scan is complete
   the scanned image is sitting on the Linux box ready to be processed.

This can work for any scanner that has a DOS scanner command. It may be
possible to write an app for windows - but I don't know Windows.

I thought he was clear the first time. When the modem is set to autoanswer
it will answer the phone even if the system connected to the modem is
down.

The alternative is to leave the modem as is and run a getty that will
tell the modem to answer when the getty sees the 'RING' string that the
modem sends whenever the phone rings. That way if the system (and obviously
the getty) is down then the phone will just ring off the hook instead of
the modem picking up the phone, negotiating the link with the other modem
and then - nothing - because the machine the modem is connected to is down.

It's really just a matter of taste. I prefer the system answering the phone
because the modem connecting implies to me that I'm going to get a connection.
With the system controlling the answer process the modems will never connect
if the system is down.

Clear?

Another reason for using PPP is because you CAN set an asyncmap to escape
control characters.  If you have to go through a terminal server on the
way to your PPP server, you will want to escape some extra control characters
like escape if you go through a telnet.  I don't _think_ this can be done
with SLIP, but if it can, i would be happy if someone would correct me (and
tell me how).
