Reply-To: simmons@EE.MsState.Edu

Does anybody have a good, well thought-out system of assuring that a PPP
link between two UNIX boxes stays up, through the use of crontab entries?

Presently, I have two linux boxes at each end sitting on their respective
networks, and hooked up to the phone lines via 28.8kbps modems.  The machine
on the campus-side is running a getty on the line, and the remote machine
calls in to it.  (Under ideal curcumstances, it would just have to call in
once, and the link would stay up perpetually, but alas, we do not live in
an ideal world.)

Presently, I have a crontab entry on the campus machine which is invoked
every {14,29,44,59} minutes past the hour.  It checks to see if the link
is up by pinging the remote machine a few times, and grepping for a positive
responce.  (Regretably, this is the BSD-style ping, not the Sun-style ping
that will report an "alive" or "no answer".)  If the remote machine does
not pong the pings, the ppp process is killed off so that the getty can
be run and accept calls from the remote machine trying to re-establish
the link.  There is also a crontab entry at {1,16,31,46} that makes sure
arp tables entries and routing tables are set up correctly, but that
is immaterial.

The remote machine tries to ping the campus machine every {0,15,30,45}
minutes past the hour and if dead, runs the char script that logs in to
the remote computer and re-establish the link.
(hopefully exactly one minute after the campus machine realized something
was up and killed off the useless ppp so the getty could answer the call...)

This mechinism seems somewhat kludgy, and I was wondering if anybody
has implemented any better way.  (And yes, the PPP link does die every
now and then due to natural causes, requiring a mechinism.)

Thanks for any ideas.

David

This is almost certainly due to using gcc 2.4.5.
Both the kernel _and_ insmod have to be compiled with gcc 2.5.8

Sorry, but that's the way it is...

Try this:
gcc test.cc -o test -lm

You're not linking in the maths library. The -lm cures that. You shouldn't
have been able to compile the above as c or c++ without it. I'd also be
careful of calling your executable test. I've got Slackware 2 installed and,
if you do a man 1 test, you'll find the manpage for Gnu test. On my system,
that lives in /usr/bin, which was before my home directory in my path. Oh,
cos returns a double as well.   :-)

It worked for me back then; just *don't* apply the ftape-irq-dma.patch.
It's for the new kernels.  If you buy a Conner C250MQ, apply the
ftape-conner.patch if you use Conner's DOS/Windows software to format
your tapes.

Hi all,

I have to make a terminal server, containing a 16 port serial board, mostly 
for SLIP dial-in work. At the moment I have 4 modems installed in our Linux 
Server itself, but I want to move all modems to a sepparate machine, which 
will be connected to our Ethernet backbone. I would like to 'run' this 
terminal server from a floppy disk, while all disk-io should come from the 
main server.  How do I do this?  

Also, which 16 port board, compatible with Linux, should I buy, and where can 
I get it? Here in New Zealand I cannot get the BOCA board. Anybody has an 
address where I can order one?

Any help and hints are very much appreciated!

Bart.

(1) Create the file /home/cheema/work/nofinger.c :

main()
{
printf ("get that finger outa my face!\n");
}

(you may wish to replace that message with something more apropos)

(2) compile with : cc -o nofinger nofinger.c

(3) now replace the "finger" line in /etc/inetd.conf to read :

finger  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /home/cheema/work/nofinger nofinger

(4) find the process ID of inetd (29 on my machine, of course it depends
    on your startup sequence) with ps aux, kill -HUP it to make inetd 
    re-read its configuration files.

    Killing it outright and restarting will doubtless work too, but may mess
    something else up.

(5) now "finger" your machine (using full netpath of course, i.e.,
    finger @sparco.com to see your message.

Obviously move the files around to taste.

NOW, the nasty bit - the usual way to "secure" a local net is to firewall
it via the gateway, that is, you have a bridge machine which filters out
what gets to you. It does bring piece of mind to the suits, who don't know
their computers from their fax machines, and who certainly wouldn't like 
just *anyone* from messing with the system parameters. For example, my 
nofinger program *could* be written to have a hidden back door. And people
who are afraid of the finger program are generally pretty tense.

If you're firewalled, this won't work because the daemon will never be 
woken up, because the datagram will never get there. 

Maybe you know all this. If so, sorry for prattling on.

Good Luck.

                        LINUX JOURNAL FAQ
                             6/23/94

This  FAQ  contains information about Linux Journal, the magazine
covering the Linux Community. Topics covered are:
  o general/history
  o content
  o subscriptions
  o writing for LJ
  o advertising in LJ
  o Linux-related product releases
  o consultants directory
  o distributors/retailers
  o misc
  o if all else fails ...

General/History

We see our mission as serving the Linux community  while  working
to  promote  the  use of Linux. Although most of our initial sub-
scribers have come from the Internet we expect half of our future
readers  will  find  LJ as their initial source of information on
Linux. This means that LJ can provide a way for  people  to  find
hardware,  software  and help in getting themselves going. We see
this as a benefit to the Linux newsgroups  by  reducing  "newbie"
questions as well to our advertisers by providing them with a new
way to reach potential new users.

The idea for producing Linux Journal arose in early 1993. In late
February, 1994 we mailed our first issue. The magazine received a
very positive response - both on the Internet and elsewhere.  Is-
sue #4, the August issue, will be released in mid-July.

SSC,  publisher  of  Unix  and  C  pocket references for over ten
years, is now the publisher, with Phil Hughes having the  overall
responsibility  for  the complete publication. Phil's 11 years in
publishing and 15 years of experience with Unix will  be  applied
to  ensure  the  quality of the publication as well as its promo-
tion.

Michael K. Johnson is now the editor.  He  founded  the  original
"man  project",  which  was  the forerunner of the current "Linux
Documentation Project", and maintains a few  Linux  packages,  as
well as the "Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide".

Content

Each  issue  of Linux Journal offers articles that appeal to new-
comers as well as serious technical articles for  long-time  Unix
users. Although LJ is Linux-specific, many of the articles are of
interest to Unix users and other users of freely  redistributable
software.

Regular columns include:
  o Interviews with prominent Linux personalities
  o Linux Programming Tips by Michael Johnson
  o What's GNU? by Arnold Robbins
  o Cooking with Linux by Matt Welsh
  o The Debian Distribution by Ian Murdock
  o New Products
  o Letters to the Editor
  o Book and Product Reviews
  o Linux Counter
  o Linux Consultant's Directory

Features that have appeared in Linux Journal include:
  o Tips for Optimizing Memory Usage by Jeff Tranter
  o Sendmail+IDA by Vince Skahan
  o World Wide Web by Bernie Thompson
  o Comparison of Linux, Windows NT and OS/2 by Bernie Thompson
  o Onyx: a copylefted 4GL by Michael Kraehe
  o Icmake: a new make tool by Frank Brokken and Karel Kubat
  o Linux and Hams: what hams involved in Linux have to say
  o Hints & Tips for Optimizing Linux Disk Usage by Jeff Tranter
  o Linux Systems Administration by Mark Komarinski
  o Linux Journal Survey Results
  o Linux Around the World
  o The Linux File System Standard by Daniel Quinlan
  o Linux Distributions
  o Wine Status

Subscriptions

Subscriptions are available internationally through SSC directly.
They are also available in specific regions through our  interna-
tional distributors. Magazines are mailed internationally through
a "surface air lift" service which delivers the magazines quickly
to  the countries of destination where local mail will be handled
by surface delivery.

Subscription rates are as follows:
    $19/year U.S., $24/year Canada, $29/year Foreign
    $34/2 years U.S., $44/2 years Canada, $49/2 years Foreign
    Back issues are available for $4 ($6 airmail) while supplies last.

At this address we can accept payment by  checks  in  U.S.  funds
drawn  on a U.S. bank or a foreign bank in their native currency,
American Express, Visa and MasterCard.  Since the internet is not
a  secure  network,  you may not wish to send credit card numbers
via email.

Subscriptions start with the next issue of Linux  Journal.   Back
issues,  if  still available, are $4 each or $6 each for air mail
delivery.

Writing for Linux Journal

Articles in Linux Journal cover the range  from  "how  do  I  get
started"  to kernel hacking. We intend to try to strike a balance
so the magazine will be accessible to the newcomer and  yet  con-
tinue to contain useful information to long-term Linux users.

Also,  in  order to legitimize Linux to many business unix users,
we need to offer articles on commercial uses for Linux. They  can
be  in  the  form of documenting a place/job where Linux is being
used commercially, a technical article on the  development  of  a
commercial application, or a review of a commercial product.

If you are considering writing for LJ or have a lead to a commer-
cial use, contact our editor, Michael Johnson. He can be  reached
via e-mail at ljeditor@sunsite.unc.edu, or as Editor, Linux Jour-
nal, P.O. Box 85867, Seattle, WA 98145-1867

Advertising in LJ

Linux Journal is supported by a combination of  subscription  and
advertising  revenue.  Rates  are  competitive  for the number of
readers we reach and our specific  target  audience  matches  the
needs of those who have products targeted to the Linux market.

We currently only offer display advertising. Future plans include
classified advertising and a card deck. If  you  are  interested,
request a media kit and rate card.

Consultant's Directory

We maintain a directory of consultants that work with Linux.  The
directory  is  published periodically in Linux Journal. The first
listing is currently free, and rates for subsequent listings  are
reasonable. To be listed, send your name, company, address, phone
and e-mail and/or fax contact information along with a brief  de-

Distributors/Retailers

We are in the process of setting up newsstand distribution of LJ.
Computer Literacy Bookstores and Barnes & Noble carry  the  maga-
zine  and  we  expect to get distribution to many other stores in
the next few months.

If you are aware of a store that should carry LJ you can  suggest
they  contact SSC at (206) 527-3385 about reselling or send us e-
mail at dist@ssc.com with their contact information.

Misc

Q: Is LJ available Electronically?
A: Not yet. Once we have the paper copy under control we plan  to
work on this. It requires contract arrangements with both authors
and advertisers before we can do it.

Q: Can information printed in LJ be reprinted?
A: Authors may use the material with the only  restriction  being
that if they use it immediately they include the phrase "reprint-
ed with permission of Linux Journal". Other people wishing to use
material  should contact LJ.  Permission is generally granted ex-
cept where restricted by author or other prior copyright.

If All Else Fails ...

If your question isn't  answered  here,  send  e-mail  to  ljedi-
tor@sunsite.unc.edu.   We  will send a e-mail response and, if it
is a common question we will add it to this  FAQ.  If  you  don't
have  e-mail,  you  can  fax  questions to (206) 526-0803 or call
(206) 524-8338.

OK, let's leave it like this.
Try the ftape that comes with slackware 2.0.0.
If it works, great. You're one of the lucky few.
You ought to play the stock exchange.
Why not ask Sharron Stone to marry you?

But if that ftape doesn't work,
upgrade to Linux 1.1.50 --
it may not be necessary to go all the way, but why not? --
and use ftape-1.13b with the ftape-irq-dma.patch.

Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?

I have the same problem. When I ftp from my novell server to my linux box. 
The entire file will transfer except the last 1 or 2K. How can this be fixed?

The file you want to have in your homes is .xsession, not .xinitrc.
Xdm sources the sytem Xsession, which sources the user's, or uses a
failsafe config.  man xdm is very helpful.  You should be able to just
copy your .xinitrc to .xsession (or symlink it...).  Nose around with
the man pages and look around in your xdm directory. (probably
/usr/lin/X11/xdm - for slackware at least)

hope this helps,
Stephen

An Xconfig won't do you much good... there are currently no Xservers
that support the Matrox MGA chip.  You can run the card in absurly low
resolution by picking the VESA defaults/generic options for the vga_16
Xserver.
HOWEVER, there is a VERY nice COMMERCIAL Xserver in beta test that
works on the MGA.  It is made by Metrolink, and is well on it's way to
being ready.

Subject: Information when TELNET
Date: 29 Sep 1994 19:54:58 GMT

Does anyone know where to modify in the Linux system so that I can display  
some information telling people what login name and password to use when  
someone "telnet" to this Linux system? I have some accounts set up for  
public access and would like to provide an informative pointer.

Thanks a lot  in advance.
