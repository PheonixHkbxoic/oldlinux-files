Hi,

As I wrote earlier, our Linux system hangs up occasionally and we simply
have been unable to figure out why (everything works fine).

Last day when one of ours logged in, the following message appeared:

panic: kernel trap (ignored)

Could somebody explain when the system prints out this message?
Maybe that could help us to find finally the reason of our problems.

Additionally, we get this "failed" message at every boot (But WHAT failed???)

Aug 30 12:23:51 cern kernel: Calibrating delay loop.. ok - 33.22 BogoMips

   Hi  !

   Does anybody know when the new dosemu is available ? I'm just
   asking, because at this moment we're using Kernel 1.1.25 with dosemu0.52
   and we want to upgrade to the newest kernels, but dosemu isn't running
   with these kernels. I've read that this is a bug in dosemu [ perhaps not
   really a bug ] and that the new one will work with the newest kernels.
   So I kept looking at sunsite and tsx11 for the least few weeks but no new
   dosemu was there. Does anybody know, where to look, to find the most 
   up-to-date Version of dosemu ?

             Thanks in advance

Hello there:

        I can not remembered where I got that file because it has been a while. 
I tried the sunsite, but it seems not there. I can only find the generic one

        Can anyone who has this file send me a copy or tell me where I can find

I currently use dip 3.3.7 lilo to connect to my internet slip service provider.
I am able to ftp, telnet, ... just fine through the connection.  
I have a httpd server setup to serve documents to Mosaic users.  When I access
the server locally, all is ok.  Also, access from a remote Sun and PC with
winsock works.  However, access from three other locations gives the
error "Socket has been reset".  I have run on two different httpd servers, and
their logs say that all is ok.  The only thing in common is that all of the
errors have shown up on PC's (but not all PC's).  I don't believe it is the
server.  The PC's are all running WinMosaic 2.0.  Does anyone know of a protocol or kernel anomaly that may be causing my problems?  I am REALLY pulling hair over this one.  Thanks so much to anyone with advice...

For Linux, you have to pass the "single" argument to the kernel.

At the LILO prompt, just type "linux single" (if your image's name is

Date: Thu, 1 Sep 1994 18:39:37 GMT

        If I'm not mistaken, gzip only compresses 1 file.  In other words,
if you have a group of files, gzip will only zip one of the files.  TAR's
functionality is very different from GZIP, where gzip is a compression 
product, TAR's function is to combine many files (and in different 
trees) into one file.
        So your question is really moot, as tar and gzip are really
different things entirely.  If you have many files to zip, you should use
TAR to combine them into one file, and then use gzip to zip the resulting
file.

Subject: NFS/pormapper security bug and fix (Linux)
Reply-To: Thomas.Koenig@ciw.uni-karlsruhe.de
Date: Thu, 1 Sep 1994 16:26:54 GMT

There is a security bug in Linux NFS implementations.

This problem lets any user on the Internet gain access to file systems
which can be mounted on the local host.  Apparently (from discussions
on comp.security.unix) it is being actively exploited.

There are two possible fixes to this problem:

- Install a fixed portmapper, which is now available from sunsite.unc.edu,
  and mirrors.  For the LSM, see below.

- As an emergency fix, make sure that it's impossible to mount the NFS
  exported directories locally; you'll need to edit /etc/exports for
  this. Try

# mount localhost:/exported/directory /mnt

and

# mount yourhostname:/exported/directory /mnt

to see wether you're vulnerable.  For secrity purposes, it is best
to restrict exporting NFS filesystems to exactly specified hosts
you trust, even if it's readonly.

Also note that there's a bug in all libc versions up to 4.5.26 (at
least) which throws the portmapper into a forking loop under some
conditions.  To avoid this, you'll need to use one of the newer kernels
with the CONFIG_I_AM_A_BROKEN_BSD_WEENIE option, or apply the (binary)
patch to libc 4.5.  26 contained in portmap_3_rpcfix.shar.gz (to be
found in sunsite's Incoming).

Begin3
Title:          portmap
Version:        3
Entered-date:   1994-08-31
Description:    This is a replacement portmap to fix some security holes
                in the original protocol.  Don't install any of the "old"
                portmap versions.  It also features access control to
                the portmapper via /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.
                The *shar files contain source; apply portmap_3.patch
                and compile.  You'll also need the libwrap.a from the
                tcp_wrappers package.
                To install the binaries, for which you need libc >= 4.5.26,
                copy portmap_3_bin.tar.gz to /tmp, then do (as root)
                # cd /
                # gzip -c -d /tmp/portmap_3_bin.tar.gz

    Jagadeesh> But who knows!

That was true with term 1.X versions.  Term 2.X supports
connectionless protocals.  However, NFS requires binding
to a port < 1024 on a machine that is connected with a
networking protocal supported by the kerenel.  So for right
now, NFS still won't work over term.  I've heard rummors
that the PCNFS protocal does not have this restriction,
but I've yet to see a free PCNFS driver.  So at present
I can't test this assertion.  If anyone knows of a free
PCNFS driver, please send me a reference where I can get
the source code, and I'll try to get term 2.1 to support
it.  As a secondary alternative, someone can try to write
a driver equivlent to Ange-ftp on the remote machine and
NFS on the local machine.   However, that would be a rather
major project that I'm not prepared to tackle yet.

tar * | gzip will give a smaller output because the headers will be
compressed & because the file is larger, minimizing gzip's own headers. 
You can get the same effect by using the GNU tar -z option.  gzip -r
recursively gzips files: it does not create a single file.

Thats a different and stickier question.  I don't know that either of
these is especially robust.

Point well taken, I should have looked up the README, but it was a Slackware
install, and I'm not sure the README was on the disk.  Could be, but...
I think the problem occured when I moved to a new version of Slackware,
trying to keep all the /etc stuff as is, and changing out the binaries from
underneath.  Probably a dangerous move at best.  Thus I think we had your
crond running from Vixies' config files.  Pure recipe for disaster.

Still, by way of suggestion, READMEs are great but I prefer man pages, as
they tend to stick around after the source code has been compiled, installed
and deleted.  Your man page explained the options pretty well, but the above
suggestion in the man page would have been nice.  Just a thought. ;^)
