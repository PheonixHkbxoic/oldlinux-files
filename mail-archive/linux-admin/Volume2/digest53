The easiest solution is to use the patch I posted several months
ago and apply that to lmain.c.  It closes the hole correctly and
doesn't require any extra wrapper commands.

Just to echo my disdain for binary-only distributions, I had a friend
who recently was forced to buy a Linux CD pretty much because the
spare CD I have was binary-only.  So far the only people making money
off of Linux are the CD shops.

I am trying to setup fvwm on my linux machine.
I have looked through the man pages and tried modifying
the xinitrc and the fvwmrc files.

What I want it to do is start some programs such as an
xterm and xbiff and a clock after I log into the
X console.

Is this possible with fvwm ? 
I know twm can do this but I have had other problems trying

The problem I am having is that whenever any user tries to ftp

The ls binary is in the right place I checked.

I can even do a 

ls * filename

I am setting up some Xterminals. The linux box will be the
server. The X terms run under MS Windog and hence are
capable of managing their own windows.

The only problem is that the linux box insists on managing
the windows, so I have to run the Xserver in a virtual root
window.

Teh xterminals connect to the linx box initially by an XDMCP
broadcats. The linux box replies with (willing to manage)
message. 

I had previously set this system up in a SUN os environment
and the suns would let the Xclient manage its own windows.

Can linux let the client manage its own windows ?
Do I have to create an entry in the Xaccess or Xservers file ?

please help...

(I *SHOULD* say RTFM, since *MY* sportser manual tells me the answer...)

Reeally what you should do is set the port speed to the highest possible
rate the the chip will support. If you have a UART 16550, then go ahead
and set it to 38400 (or even 56700??) Remember that a 14400 modem will do
compression and the such, and I have HEARD (never seen) that on good
days, when the moon is right, and so on, you _might_ get a throughput rate
of 56kB.

I run mine at 38400 with a UART 16550, and it works just fine.

Of course: just put them in your .xinitrc together with all the command
line parameters they need. First execute these x-apps and then as last line in
your .xinitrc state 'exec fvwm'

Subject: A couple of Linux problems...
Date: 11 Sep 1994 23:07:24 -0400

I have Linux installed on my system in addition to the latest OS/2 Warp-II
beta and of course DOS/Windows using OS/2's boot manager.

Whenever I shutdown OS/2 and boot linux, I always get a 'HPFS Drive Improperly
CLosed Flag Set' (or something like that) and my HPFS partition never gets
mounted. (I always do a proper shutdown though so I should not be getting this
error)

Also, when I boot from floppy (linux) there is a section where it says
'Calibrating Delay loop' 25.04 Bogomips...

When I boot from hard drive though, immediately after the Bogomips count I get
a 'Failed' message on the next line...

What is failing ? ANd how can I fix it ?
. 
Thanks for any advice.

It appears to me that the 38400 mark is just a convention.  You can
have the serial driver reinterpret it as 57600 by using the spd_hi
option with the setserial command.  What you are doing, in this case,
is sending data at 57600 bits per second to the modem, which compres-
ses it, then sends it at 9600(+?) baud over the phone to another modem
that decompresses it.  V.42bis compression can achive a 4:1 ratio, so
57600 is an ideal rate.  You must enable rts/cts flowcontrol, though,
I believe, since otherwise you can overflow the modem's buffers (if,
say, it can't quite reach 4:1 compression, but is getting stuff in
at the maximum rate of 57600).

I might remind everyone reading this that I'm no guru (if that's not
obvious).  I just had this incredible brainstorm that maybe the FAQs,
HOWTOs, and man pages might have something useful to say.  I'm always
the first to encourage old hands to be nice.  But the crabby netters
who go around screaming RTFM do have a point.

Tell Linux that the modem is 38400. This should work fine with a Sportster.
The line speed is still 14400, but the serial port speed (computer to modem)
is higher. This has to be in order to get any use out of compression. If you
use minicom, be sure to set auto baud detect off, and ALWAYS use hardware
flow control at these (relatively) high speeds.

One word of caution - be SURE to power the sportster off before plugging/
unplugging the power supply - I have had THREE of these modems fry this way.
And I had one power supply decide to send a bunch more volts than usual one
day - also fried the modem. IMHO, these cheap modems are just that - cheap.

Hello all.

I am trying to install the ftape package onto my 486 and I
can't seem to get the "modules" package to compile.

I've got the modules.tar.gz package from sunsite
under /pub/Linux/kernel.  I am using GCC 2.5.8 running
under Slackware Linux 1.0.  Apparently, the compiler returns
an error that "struct symbol_table" is undefined.  I can't find
it anywhere in the #include files.  Was the declaration left out?
Am I missing a .h file?  (There were none included in the
modules archive!)  Help!  

I'd love to get my tape drive (a Colorado 250 Jumbo) up and
running!  I need desperately to do a backup!

Thanks in advance for any help!!

Apparently, Warp-II is failing? I've heard there is a CSD already for this,
but I can't find it anywhere. Linux may also be making false assumptions 
about the OS/2 HPFS 'dirty' bit - I think I read something about that here
once before.

For example, take a look at the "dialog" program, as found on:

I have not checked, though, whether 0.3 is still the latest version

The "user" option automatically turns on the nosuid, the nodev

to plug another security hole: otherwise users could bring in
their floppy disk, which contains a user-writable copy of the
/dev/hda (or /dev/sda) device special file ...
