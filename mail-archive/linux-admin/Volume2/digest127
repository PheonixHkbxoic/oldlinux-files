Patch, like make (when it comes from GNU) has the option '-s' for silent, to
report errors only, not the files it succeeded on.

You can too do a 'find -name \*rej' after applying the patches.

As far as I know, the EE32 and the later versions of the NE3200 are identical.

And then, the AC3200 driver should also work with the Mylex LNE390, the Eagle

The only difference from model to model is the table that translates the

Hi,

I have to copy very well filled up 16GB-tapes between two SCSI tape drives
on a daily base under Linux. Does anyone know to do this task with low level
commands. I think there are basic SCSI-commands for simply copying from
one device to another which should be a lot faster than 'dd'. But how are

I've helped a couple folks get this straightened out this month... and I
guess I did a fairly good job of it, because one of the HOWTO editors
asked me to write it up.  I'm in the midst of doing just that, and I
should have it vetted and ready to post by the weekend.  

As soon as I have it double checked by a couple people, I'll be mailing it
to the editor in question, and posting it to c.o.l.admin and possibly
somewhere else, if someone is convincing enough. :-)

So look for the Routing-HOWTO in about a week or less.

Bad News Bret.... Compaq doesn't like to tell people developing free
software what bits to tweak on their hardware.  I've been down this road
on several items.

You know that nice 32-bit ethernet Netflex NIC they sell?  Linux doesn't
like it or even try to recognize it.

Motherboard SCSI controller?  Same damn story.

Memory past 16MB?  Good luck - please let me know if you figure that one
out. 
I wore out TWO EISA Config discs trying to get my Prosignia P5-60 to use
anything above 16 MB.

So I run an Adaptec 2740, SMC Ultra-16 ethernet, and 16MB RAM on my
Pentium server.

I don't know the answer to your questions but an alternative would be to use plp
instead. You can find its latest version in ftp.iona.ie. It's got a lot more
features than Berkeley's lp suite and one of them is to have optionnaly lpr
directly log accounting information. So no more need to have it done by a filter.

Well I can vouch that the problem exists and so can seveal other Linux users.
With my system I get the same exact problem, but when i connect to
Xylogics, Annex or Chase TS's the probelm isn't there.
 
But, I have used Lan Workplace for DOS, Chameleon 4.0, Super TCP,
Trumpet, CUTCP, WATTCP, and InterSLIP and I must admit the
problem doesn't seem to occur with them.
 

It is pretty annoying though.  I keep having to escape back to the
TS pronpt to see the next line and get lots of timeouts on
Zmodem downloads.  rlogining in after issuing the "term down"
command seems to help for downloading though....

How about using a "fake" ethernet address.  Modify dosemu packet driver
to return a different fake ethernet address for every dosemu process.
And then set the network card to promiscus mode. (ifconfig eth0 promisc).

I did this with one dosemu process and I was able to get CUTCP working
from within dosemu. In theory it should work with multiple dosemu's.
(I hope there won't be problem with multiple SOCK_PACKET sockets ....)

A better mechanism (without having to set the card to promiscus mode) 
would be to have a virtual network device that communicated between 
packet drivers and existing network interface,  to allow multiple 
packet drivers for same/different dosemu's ...  This is already being
discussed so hold on!
