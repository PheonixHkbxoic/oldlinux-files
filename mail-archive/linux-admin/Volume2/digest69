Subject: SLIP hangups?
Date: 14 Sep 1994 20:13:27 GMT

My SLIP connections (via dip 3.3.7-strauss) hang up afer a random amount
of time from 3 minutes to several hours.  The hangups seem to be 
independent of traffic amount.  

What actually happens is that dip spews several error messages to 
the console, then drops the connection.  I remember seeing 

dip: tty: set_disc() : I/O error
dip: tty: set_state() : I/O error
dip: tty: hangup(DROP) : I/O error

usually all at the same time.   [as a side note, the first time I 
tried to post this I was trying to remember the error messages 
and my emacs cursor was right after the ``seeing'' in the above 
paragraph when the bug occurred:  I heard the modem relay click 
and the errors appeared on my screen right where I wanted to type 
them!  How helpful of the computer.  I cursed loudly.]

If I set the modem to ignore DTR, the line will stay connected after 
dip spews and exits.  This leads me to believe that the problem is 
with dip, not with the modem or the phone line.  

Has anyone else seen this behavior?  If so, is there a fix?

Thanks for any info --

 have heard that Linux can run COFF and ELF headers, so I think that it is possible to run programs that were compiled for SCO UNIX.

My question is: is this true? Really you can run programs compiled for SCO
over Linux? What are the steps you need to do it. Where can I find documentationon it?. What about dosemu?

Please, answer to my e-mail system. I am not sure of getting of the answers

Date: 14 Sep 1994 02:46:28 GMT

It seems that I'm not the only one who is having problem with the
PAS 16 SCSI.  I've got the Yggdrasil Summer release and a NEC 3x.
Almost every time I boot the machine I get this:

SCSI host 0 timed out - aborting command
SCSI host 0 abort ( ) timed out - reseting

and hangs.  The door on the CDROM don't even open.  I have to shut
off the machine before it'll work.  It work just fine under DOS.
I think there is something wrong with the drivers?  I've tried to slow
the mahcine down but no luck.  For some reason I got it to work once
and I installed the CD just fine.  After I shut it off, it don't work
again.  What's going on?

check out the setting you are using for your MTU

MTU = Maximum Transmission Unit

If MTU is big (>1024) you will get higher ftp rates but, when you are
ftp'ing you will get slow response times..

if MTU is small (<1024) you will get lower ftp rates but things will
be more responsive...

Hope this helps..

The 'user' option automatically implies the 'nosuid' option. 'noauto' means

Well, I hate to say this, but if you haven't made a back-up for 8 months, 
you were kind of asking for it.  Unless your data is worth nothing to 
you, Ild suggest you invest $100 in a Colorado Tape unit and make regular

Uh Uh.  Linux needs linux partitions. FDISk doesn't know how to make 
these (there's an ID numebr that identifies what kind of parition you 
have.)  The thing to do is make your DOS parition under DOS fdisk, and 
your Linux partitions under Linux fdisk or cfdisk.

Uh uh again, sorry.  All fdisk /MBR will do is install a DOS boot over 
your LILO in your boot sector.  If you reformatted a partition for Linux, 
its history in terms of DOS data.  (Actually, thats not 100% true.  There 
are data recovery services out there that can generally recover part of 
your data after a re-format, but they're very expensive and there is no 
gaurantee of what you will get back.  Also, the more you used the drive 
after you did this, the less data will be available for recovery...)

No, actually there are plenty of legitimate sys-admin type questions to
keep their lines busy.  I've called them at their office in sunnyvale
about my one installtion problem (the Fall94 sony interface problem) and
they were quite helpful.  I was also courteous, organized, and recognized
that in a very real way their time is money.  i made it easy for them to
tell me what was up, and they in turn were nice enough(or reasonable
enough, if you prefer) not to charge me for it.  In fact, one of my 2
questions WAS a sysadmin question, and I offered them my credit card, but
it only took a minute so they told me not to bother. 

Cut them some slack.  I think you're assuming they are just like the big 
OS makers (such as that one in Washington.)  I've found them to be 
reasonable, helpful people.

Why? Thsi person already has the yygdrasil, and unless he tells us more 
details, it sounds liek his problem is just not cracking the binder.  
If you read their docs, the getting started instructions are about half a

as has been mentioned before, the big tree also seels a Linux Bible that

No, i don't work for them.  I have just found their products to be 
reasonable and their attitude helpful.  Thats soemthing tht aught to be
