Help!

I have 2 hard drives.  The smaller hard drive is my /home directory.  For
whatever reason, if I copy/move large files onto that drive, Linux crashes. 
It goes into guru meditation mode, in which you can type anything you want
on the screen, you will not get a prompt.

This happened on my other system as well, so I am very sure it is a general
Linux problem.  I am using IDE drives.

Any hints?  Any patches to fix this?  I am using Linux Slackware v.1.0, with
no patches on the kernel.

Please email any replies.  I don't get to read the newsgroup too often, so I
miss a lot of info.

One caveat: some (all?) Linux distributions do not have the user
"nobody" and group "nogroup".  I created them, gave them bare minimum
privileges, and set them up as user and group in "httpd.conf".  It
seems more secure than running httpd as root (but perhaps I'm
just giving myself a false sense of security).

On our SPARC, many programs require "nobody" and "nogroup" to work.

Please folks, don't make this kind of fixes inside kernel since
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS. The kernel and it's drivers are designed to compile
without errors. This kind of compiling error is 99% sure indication that
there are serious error on your installation. For example the driver is not
compatible with your current kernel at all. It could also be possible that
some sources are from older version than the others. 

The _ONLY_ safe reaction in this kind of situation is to perform the 
installation from the beginning. If it doesn't help then the next step
is to ask for help usinig comp.os.linux.help.

Running kernel compiled using this kind of trick causes almost certainly
serious crach sooner or later.


The error "/dev/audio: No such file or directory" means that you have to create
the device files (/dev/audio etc) using the script at the end of
linux/drivers/sound/Readme.linux.

Currently I have the Walnut Creek Yggd. version (Fall 94).  I want

reason the system cannot find the file libX11.so.3 when I run
xinit.  "find" sees the file on the hard disk ok and so does
 "which".  I have my XFILESEARCHPATH set to the hard disk, but
 this doesn't help.  If I remount the CD it all works fine

I am trying to use xdm, so the users can boot directly into X.  It runs
great, except it loads the openlook window manager by default.  I want
it to load Motif (or any other wm for instance).  I've searched through
all of man pages on xdm and none of them mention the window manager.
None of the xdm config files mention a windows manager.  The .xinitrc
loads Motif.  Motif comes up fine if I don't use xdm and type startx.

Any suggestions?

A better solution is to USE the features of tcpd.

There are two files which determine whether or not a daemon gives out
information under tcpd:  hosts.allow and hosts.deny     (hosts_access(5))

You might like to do this:

<hosts.deny>:
fingerd: ALL : cat nofinger.text


<hosts.allow>:
fingerd: .your.domain



This says:  if anyone in my domain tries to finger accept the connection,
            otherwise, cat some text at them.

I'm interested in getting an account package that will work with a
serial postscript printer so that I can charge user accounts for the
pages that they print.

I'm trying to compile the lprps-2.5 package (I was using lprps under
Ultrix until that machine died recently).  Does anyone have a working
version of this or another utility to do postscript page accounting ?

Here's the output from a make or lprps:

Who the hack told you that 46 was the correct major device number?
Try 9 instead, and it should work. 

BTW: the official lists of device-numbers can be found in:

This is official because its the one that the kernel incorporates during
compilation...

Subject: Slackware 2.0.1 on CD-ROM! Trans-Ameritech Release 4 !!!
Date: 29 Sep 1994 00:58:21 GMT

Trans-Ameritech Systems announcing the Linux Plus BSD  CD-ROM Release 4.

The company that pionered the Slackware distribution on a CD-ROM, the "live"
file-system and DOS-assisted installation procedures is proud to announce
a new revolutionary Installation Free (tm) release of Linux. 

We hope you will find it easy to install and use. This CD-ROM has one feature  
not found on any other distribution of Linux: it is possible (and very easy!)
to start running Linux from your hard drive WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE NORMAL
INSTALLATION ROUTINE! It will work with ANY CD-ROM that DOS can read. The only
assumption that the automated procedure makes,is that you have an IDE drive C:
with at least 20 MB of disk space to automatically put a Linux system with
X-windows on! We call this a Test Drive. After going through this, you can
add software by a normal "setup" procedure or you can decide to dedicate a
partition to Linux.

The Release 4 is based on the brand new release of Slackware  2.0.1 that is
considered by the author (Patrick Volkerding) to be very stable and a major 
milestone. The full Slackware tree (145 MB compressed!) is provided as well
as the Slackware sources tree. And of course the Trans-Ameritech trademark
"live" filesystem that can be used to save disk space. In addition to the
many kernels of all flavors that come with Slackware, we provide a number of
kernels based on the post-code-freeze Linux kernel 1.1.50. It has many 
desirable features not found in the 1.0.x kernels standard with most 
distributions:  
        Considerable improvements in disk performance - SCSI and IDE
        Support for huge IDE disks (over 1024 cylinders).
        Support for the IDE CD-ROMs (NEC 260).
        Standard support for UMSDOS filesystem.
        Way too much more to list here.

The highlights of this release:

        DOOM for Linux!!!
        Read-only Double-Space filesystem!
        NCR PCI SCSI.
        IDE CD-ROM support.
        TGIF - Xlib based interactive 2-D drawing facility under X11. 
        An X server for et4000/w32-based boards. 
        Software for the Ham Radio enthusiasts.
        Two sets of compilers and libs - 4.4.4 and 4.5.26
        Kernels from 1.0.9 to 1.1.50.
        qfax 1.0
        Jazz 1.0 - a  comfortable MIDI sequencer 
        Easy configuration of Xwindows.
        New NTeX 1.2
        BSD Sendmail 8.6.9
        util-linux-1.10
        term 2.1.0
        calc2.9.3t8 - arbitrary precision calculator. 
        irsim - An event-driven logic-level simulator for MOS circuits 
        DOSEMU 52.3 beta for the new kernels.

        FreeBSD packages 1.1



Other important software:
        GNU emacs 19.25 and 19.26 for tty and X.
        Interviews - text and graphics utilities
        ANDREW
        

If you prefer to go through a much more flexible custom installation, an MSDOS
based program provided on the CD-ROM ("install.exe") will help you make the 
right choice of a boot kernel depending on the hardware that you have and will
actually create the two floppies to be used for Linux installation. 
Furthermore, the "setup" script modified by the Trans-Ameritech, will put the 
kernel used during the installation on your hard disk for use with actual 
operation. This guarantees that all the hardware that worked during the 
installation will continue to work afterwards.   

The important documentation is uncompressed and ready to read under DOS before
installing Linux on the CD-ROM.

Subject: how to set up my Linux box as a GATEWAY?
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 00:40:28 GMT


Greetings, *.

I've put together a little home network, consisting of several DOS PC's 
(running TCP/IP packages) and my Linux box.  I have my own set of IP 
addresses assigned from the NIC (192.160.60.xxx, Class C).

My Linux machine has a PPP connection (through a local Internet service 
provider) to the rest of the Internet.

I would like my Linux box to act as a "gateway" between my local 
network, and the rest of the Internet.

The details:

All of my machines are assigned addresses in the 192.160.60.xxx range.

My Internet service provider assigns my Linux box it's own address when 
it dials in -- usually something like 199.201.128.101.

All of the DOS PC's are set so that they use my Linux box as the gateway 
(i.e. if you try to use an IP address not on the local network, it gets 
sent through the gateway).

Picture of network setup:
