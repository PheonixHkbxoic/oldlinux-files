This is the Linux Project Registry, v.1.1. It is divided into several parts, as
follows:
	*  (I) Short Listing of Projects Underway 
	* (II) Abstracts/Descriptions of Projects from (I)
	*(III) Short Listing of Continuing Projects
	* (IV) Abstracts/Descriptions of Projects from (III)
	*  (V) Linux Mailing Lists/Channels
	* (VI) Completed projects

But first, some Administrivia.
First and foremost: 
	You will notice that there are two new sections:
		(V) Linux Mailing Lists/Channels
	       (VI) Completed Projects
	If you have additional entries, send 'em my way. I know there
	are more lists and channels,but danged if I know what they are. :-)
Also:
	This is a Project Registry. I am not a project coordinator, and
	unless my name is listed on a project, I really can't help you
	with questions on that project. I'd like to, but I really can't.
	Please direct questions on projects to the appropriate person,
	mailing list, or to comp.os.linux.
Next:
	The list is going weekly, at least until it gets established. 
	I've recieved excellent responses to the list, and it looks 
	like this thing will actually work! :-)
	Oh, yeah. It's moving from every Friday to every Monday.
Last:
	New entries or changes to entries will now be marked with an
	asterisk (*) in the first column. Also, the section listing
	above will have a * in front of its section number if there's
	a changed entry in the section.

As always, We Thank You for Your Support! ;-)

And now begins the Linux Project Registry...

================    PART II    ===========================================

I have translated the comments of the programmers/porters as best I could.
Quotes ("") indicate that the programmer/porter's own description is used.
(If I've messed anything up, please feel free to let me know. Nicely. :-)

1) Port of X386 to work with standard VGA
2) Keyboard patches to allow switching of keys (eg--<Ctrl> for <Caps Lock>)
   gone from back burner to fridge.
3) Kernel TCP/IP support, in Alpha.3 Release. Testers are needed; see the 
   NET channel of the mailing list for more information or to volunteer.
4) "boottime root choice. i.e. at boot time, as user for root partition
    (with default and timeout)." 
5) "ISO9660 filesystem (CDROM)" now beta; no known or outstanding bugs.
6) "SCSI support for CDROM" works fine, but has known bugs and difficulty
   with existing SCSI support; now beta
7) Port of X386 server to work with video cards regiter-compatible with 
   IBM 8514/A Display Adapter. Alpha testing begins 27 July, 1992, and
   testers with non-ATI, 8514/A-register-compatible adapters are needed.
   Please contact martin@cs.unc.edu (Kevin E. Martin) to volunteer.
8) Implementation of Common Lisp for Linux 
9) Err, 'nuff said, eh? :-) 0.97, Patch level 2 is the most currentest 
   version (as of Noon, CST, 28 August, 1992 :-).
10) 0.97.1 is the most current version of the root disk.
11) Due for an end-of-August release (maybe). "Hopefully the best damn
    guide you will ever see." ;-)
12) SoundBlaster/SoundBlaster Pro/AdLib sound card support; currently only
    plays sampled sounds; full support in the works.
13) Will begin work on AHA 1732 32-bit SCSI drivers in late August (unless
    someone beats him to it).
14) porting Patrick Powell's PLP lpd software from U of Minnesota.
15) X386 Trident support is in alpha test stage, and has been sent to Orest
    for inclusion in the next release of X386.
16) MS-DOS file system support is currently supported in the kernel, and
    allows MS-LOSS (err-I mean "MS-DOS" :-) floppies and HDs to be mounted.
17) LILO is a fs-independent boot loader which can boot other systems and
    allows interactive selection of the kernel or OS to be booted.
18) GRASS (Geographical Resources Analysis Support System) 4.0 is a PD
    raster/vector GIS (Geographic Info System), image processing system,
    and graphic production system used extensively at government offices,
    universities, and commercial organizations encompassing 250 user
    programs, written in C, containing over 300,000 lines of code. 
	(Description provided by Alastair Small, from "Intro to GRASS 4"
	 by Jim Westervelt, 17, July, 1991)
19) sc (spreadsheet calculator) is in beta test, working on arrow key support.
20) Math Emulator Refinement is currently on hold.
21) The extended fs is now included in the kernel,  but Remy is still working on
    enhancing its functionality.
22) Linux kernel TCP/IP support to provide BSD4.3 socket support, as BSD source-
    based FTP and TELNET will form part of alpha release. Hopefully, socket
    routines will allow development of NFS routines.
23) Xenix emulation; now in alpha test, testers needed.
24) User space block devices--requests for read/write ops passed to user
    process instead of device driver. Once network support is added, could be
    easily modified to allow remote (non-shared) mounts of HDs. Currently works
    well enough to have user process ramdisk; wants to make Stacker-like
    program, but needs block compression code. If you want to take it over,
    email him.
25) port of xtank
26) implementation of IEEE 754 standard; still reading standards
27) working on more generic bootsect.S, to allow boot from floppy or 1M HD
    partition. Currently works on his machine, but diffs in boot sequences
    causing problems on others.
* 28) Enhanced serial drivers

     file listing

================    PART IV    ===========================================

1)This list, obviously :-). To get your project on this list (which will be
   posted bi-weekly, or weekly, if there's sufficient demand), send a 
   message with the Subject line: Linux Project Registry, and the
   body containing:
	1) your email address (if you don't include it, I'll use the address
	   from the mail-header, which tends to be messy around here)
	2) a short description of your project (see above for examples)
   and  3) a status report (eg, Alpha.3 Release, beta testing, etc.)
   to
	constellation!biglaw!registry@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu
	(constellation!biglaw!registry works from some sites;
	 constellation's full address is constellation.ecn.uoknor.edu)

   or, (IF and ONLY IF the above address doesn't work for some reason)

	callison@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu

   If you send me something to include in the list, please send me a note
   when the status changes, as well. It's kinda hard to keep up with you
   guys, as fast as you're going on some of these projects. :-)

2) the Frequently Asked Questions List. If you have a question, read it
   first. 'Nuff said.

3) The "Meta-FAQ"; a short list of pointers with accidental answers :-)

4) The "official" Linux Bug-Report site. The proper procedure is:
	1) post to comp.os.linux to determine if your bug is, in fact, a bug, or
	   if it is a problem with your system (or your system's admin :-)
	2) get the Bug Report Template, fill it out, and mail it to
		ml-linux-bugs@dg-rtp.dg.com
   If you have a bug fix/workaround, follow the same procedure, but with 
   a different template.

5) Frequently Asked Questions about mtools; primarily addresses installation
   issues. Posted regularly.

6) Linux BBS registry: a world-wide list of Linux-carrying BBSs (for those
   without Internet access).

* 7) "00-index.txt" ASCII file, lists directory contents with 40 character
      file descriptions, like those at wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and
      wuarchive.wustl.edu. Needs info on what is what at tsx-11.mit.edu.
