(V.15)   I have a Stacker volume on my hard drive.  Can I access that?
======================================================================

   ANSWER:  Yes, but you will have to do that through the dosemu
program.  For more information on it, check out the file
/pub/Linux/docs/stacker.doc at sunsite.unc.edu

   Special gcc information are located in section IX. A special section
is devoted to it since it's *the* compiler of Linux. I have
subsectionned this part in 3 subsections:

* Menu:

* VIA-00:: Misc Information
* VIB-00:: Minor/Major Information
* VIC-00:: Serial Information

(VI.01)  It seems that $#@! ported on linux don't run correctly, what do I do about reporting bugs?
===================================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Matt Welsh) It's possible that either the program itself
has a bug or that Linux has a problem that this program brings out. :)
But first check that the size of the file(s) corresponds that of the
files(s) on the FTP sites where it's available. If they're different,
either you downloaded them incorrectly (i.e. you forgot to turn on
"bin") or whoever put them on the FTP site uploaded them incorrectly.

   If that's not the problem, then post to comp.os.linux asking about
the program, to verify that it is a bug. PLEASE: when posting possible
"bug reports" include all error and output information from
running/compiling the program. Just saying "it doesn't work" isn't very
helpful. Also mention your specific setup, Linux version, GCC version,
etc. Some of these things depend on running under certain versions and
you may have missed that information.

   Note that my "ml-linux-bugs@dg-rtp.dg.com" bug reporting list has
been phased out. It turns out that Linux has so few bugs, most of which
are resolved on the newsgroup or through Linus before I can accumulate
them and post. :) In short: if there's a bug in Linux or in Linux-ported
software, it will usually be fixed in the next patchlevel or version.

(VI.02)  Has $#@! been ported to Linux?
=======================================

   ANSWER: First check out the FTP sites and read the monthly
INFO-SHEET, as well as the new "Linux News" and the META-FAQ's (all of
which are either available on the FTP sites and/or posted to the
newsgroup as they're written). Also check out the "Linux Project
Registry" (posted to the newsgroup and on the FTP sites) which lists
ongoing/current Linux projects.  Also look in the "old" Linux digests
and mailing-list archives, kept on tsx-11.mit.edu and nic.funet.fi.
Also, see if there's a GNU(*) version of the program you're looking for
(which are available everywhere).  Since Linux uses GCC as its native
compiler, most GNU software ports directly to Linux without problems.
If all else fails, ask on the mailing list or newsgroup if the program
is ported and where it's available.

   (*) GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix, which (besides being a recursive
acronym) is a project started by the Free Software Foundation (the FSF)
to write a freely distributable version of Unix.  The GNU kernel is
named HURD, and is based on Mach.  It is currently being written, and is
not yet done.  Many of the GNU utilities, however, are completed and are
much more functional than the original Unix utilities.  Since they are
freely available, Linux is using them as well.

(VI.03)  I've ported $#@! to Linux, what should i do to add it in the standard distribution?
============================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Matt Welsh) First read the previous Q/A, then talk to the
maintainers of the various releases (MCC interim, SLS, and so on) about
including your program with those releases. The best way to make
programs available to the rest of the world is to upload it to one of
the Linux FTP sites (such as tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/incoming or
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming).

   BTW Whenever you submit binaries, please think that if you link them
with shared libraries, this might cause problems for those who (gasp!)
don't have the shared libraries installed. You can either link them
using -static, and if someone wants to build a shared version on their
own machine they can get the sources (which you should also make
available) and build it themself. Or else provide the shared lib.

(VI.04)  I want to port $#@! to Linux, what are the flags?
==========================================================

   ANSWER: Recall that Linux implements subset of SYSV and POSIX, so
-DUSG and -DPOSIX work in general.

   NOTE1: SIGBUS is not there, and can be safely commented out in
general.  NOTE2: see section related to GCC, in the third part of this
FAQ, for more details.

(VI.B.) Major/Minor device number
=================================

     *** This section is maintained by Rick Miller, any comments,
     suggestions, remarks should be mailed to him at <rick@ee.uwm.edu>

     Last Update: April 1993

* Menu:

* VI-05::  What are the device minor/major numbers?
* VI-06::  (Chuck Boyer) Could some one clear up the devices meaning?

   This is a list of the device names, along with Major and minor
numbers, which the Linux kernel may currently recognize.  I say "may"
because some of them may require patches to your kernel, others must be
configured-in using the Linux kernel's "make config" routine before
compiling.

   My profuse thanks to all the writers of device drivers for Linux,
and to all those patient folks who took the time to explain their
devices to me.  May they become obscenely rich.  Until then, I hope
this list will help prevent driver collisions and perhaps lend a clue
to a newbie or two.

        IF YOU WANT ANY CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO THIS LIST, *TELL ME*!

        DEVICES NOT LISTED HERE SHOULD USE MAJOR NUMBERS *ABOVE 127*
        UNTIL ALLOCATED A MORE PERMANENT NUMBER IN THE LOWER RANGE.
        (I suggest using a more-or-less random number to avoid the
         chance of collisions with any other experimental drivers.)

        TO HAVE MAJOR/MINOR NUMBERS ALLOCATED (OFFICIALLY) FOR
        YOUR DEVICE DRIVER, SEND E-MAIL TO:  RICK@EE.UWM.EDU

Breakdown of minors by Majors:
------------------------------
  0.  Unnamed .......  (unknown) ....  for proc-fs, NFS clients, etc.
        Minors?

  1.  Memory ........  (character) ..  ram mem kmem null port zero core
        (0.  /dev/ram:  was supposed to be the ramdisk, but never got used.
         As of this date it has not been implemented and probably won't be.)
        1.  /dev/mem
        1.  /dev/ramdisk: a BLOCK device (the RAM-disk)
        2.  /dev/kmem
        3.  /dev/null
        4.  /dev/port
        5.  /dev/zero
        6.  /dev/core:  like /dev/mem, but in "core"-file format for gdb

  2.  Floppy ........  (block) ......  fd[0-3]<[dhDH]{360,720,1200,1440}>
        Minors are [[4 * type] + drive] where drive 0-3 == A:-D: (floppy)
        and type is:    0: Autodetect           4: 720k on 3.5" DD
                        1: 360k on 5.25" DD     5: 360k on 5.25" HD
                        2: 1.2M on 5.25" HD     6. 720k on 5.25" HD
                        3: 360k on 3.5" DD      7. 1.44M on 3.5" HD

        0. /dev/fd0:  Autodetected first floppy.
        1. /dev/fd1:  Autodetected second floppy.
        2. /dev/fd2:  Autodetected third floppy.
        3. /dev/fd3:  Autodetected fourth floppy.
        4. /dev/fd0d360:  360k on 5.25" DD in first drive
        5. /dev/fd1d360:  360k on 5.25" DD in second drive
                (You can work out the rest of the intermediates...)
        8. /dev/fd0h1200:  1.2M on 5.25" HD in first drive
        12. /dev/fd0D360 (/dev/fd0H360):  360k on 3.5" DD in first drive
        16. /dev/fd0D720 (/dev/fd0H720):  720k on 3.5" DD in first drive
        20. /dev/fd0h360:  360k on 5.25" HD in first drive
        24. /dev/fd0h720:  720k on 5.25" HD in first drive
        28. /dev/fd0H1440:  1.44M on 3.5" HD in first drive

     Naming goes like this:
        fd[drive][media][size]
         where: [drive]=0-3:  Corresponds to DOS's "A:"-"D:".
                [media]={d,h,D,H}:  d=Double Density 5.25" diskette
                                    h=High Density 5.25" diskette
                                    D=Double Density 3.5" diskette
                                    H=High Density 3.5" diskette
                [size]={360,720,1200,1440} kilobytes.

     Floppies are assumed to be double-sided (DS), and
        drives are assumed to be high-density devices.

  3.  AT-Disk .......  (block) ......  hd[a-d]<[0-8]>
     (For IDE, MFM, and RLE drives and controllers.)
      On the first AT controller card:
        0.  /dev/hda (/dev/hda0):  The whole first HD, including its MBR.
        1-4.  /dev/hda{1-4}:  Primary partitions on the first hard drive.
        5-8.  /dev/hda{5-8}:  Extended partitions on the first hard drive.
        64.  /dev/hdb (/dev/hdb0):  The whole second HD, including its MBR.
        65-68.  /dev/hdb{1-4}:  Primary partitions on the second hard drive.
        69-72.  /dev/hdb{5-8}:  Extended partitions on the second hard drive.
      On the second AT controller card:
        128.  /dev/hdc (/dev/hdc0):  The whole third HD, including its MBR.
        129-132.  /dev/hdc{1-4}:  Primary partitions on the third hard drive.
        133-136.  /dev/hdc{5-8}:  Extended partitions on the third hard drive.
        192.  /dev/hdd (/dev/hdd0):  The whole fourth HD, including its MBR.
        193-196.  /dev/hdd{1-4}:  Primary partitions on the fourth hard drive.
        197-200.  /dev/hdd{5-8}:  Extended partitions on the fourth hard drive.

        Notes:  BE *VERY* CAREFUL WITH the four "whole drive" devices (hda,
                hdb, hdc, and hdd)!!  These four devices embody the *entire*
                *drive*, not just one partition.  The only things that use
                them are things that need to read/change the partition table
                (like fdisk).

                Linux doesn't order anything.  It perceives partitions in the
                order in which they appear in the partition table.  Thus,
                /dev/hd?1 may follow /dev/hd?2 in the cylinder numbering.

                The names of the hard drives are not the same as under Minix.

  4.  Tty ...........  (character) ..  tty's and pty's
        0.  /dev/tty0:  This is the currently active Virtual Console.
        1-9.  /dev/tty[1-9]:  Specific virtual consoles.
        10-63.  /dev/ttyV[10-63]:  More virtual consoles that nobody uses.
        64-127.  /dev/tty[0-?][0-63]:  Dial-in serial ([controller][port]).
        128-191.  /dev/pty[p-s][0-f]:  PTY Masters.
        192-255.  /dev/tty[p-s][0-f]:  PTY Slaves. ([0-f]=0123456789abcdef)

        Notes:  NOTICE THE NEW NAMING FOR SERIAL LINES.  Serial lines will
                be named either "tty..." or "cua..." (See Major #5) followed
                by the one-digit number of the *board* the line is from, and
                the number of the line on that board.  The four default lines
                are considered to be on board "0", so what DOS calls "COM2:"
                should now be known as "/dev/tty01" or "/dev/cua01".

                For more information on the use of multi-port boards, read
                the documentation which accompanies the serial patches.

  5.  Dial-out ......  (character) ..  tty cua*
        0.  /dev/tty:  the tty that owns the process calling it.
        64-127.  /dev/cua[0-?][0-63]:  Dial-out serial ([controller][port]).
                (See Major #4 for NEW NAMING CONVENTION.)

  6.  Parallel ......  (character) ..  par[0-2] lp[0-2]
     Parallel (printer) ports.  (Increasable in include/linux/lp.h)
        0.  /dev/par0 (/dev/lp0):  First XT parallel port
        1.  /dev/par1 (/dev/lp1):  First AT parallel port
        2.  /dev/par2 (/dev/lp2):  Second AT parallel port

        Notes:  The number of line printers is defined by LP_NO which is
                found in [/usr/src]/linux/include/lp.h.

  7.  Unused.  (First come, first serve.)
        This one's getting old.  No minor numbers are yet assigned.
        It's not even in the source code.  Maybe it never will be...

  8.  SCSI-Disk .....  (block) ......  sd[a-h]<[0-8]>
        Minors numbers are ((16 * Drive) + Partition)
        where
          Drive is the number of the physical drive in order of detection
        and
          Partition is as follows:
                0   is the whole drive
                1-4 are the DOS "primary" partitions
                5-15 are the DOS "extended" (or "logical") partitions, so...

        0.  /dev/sda (/dev/sda0):  The first (detected) SCSI drive.
        1-4.  /dev/sda[1-4]:  Primary partitions on the first SCSI drive.
        5-15.  /dev/sda[5-15]:  Extended partitions on the first SCSI drive.
        16.  /dev/sdb (/dev/sdb0):  The second (detected) SCSI drive.
        17-20.  /dev/sdb[1-4]:  Primary partitions on the second drive.
        21-31.  /dev/sdb[5-15]:  Extended partitions on the second drive.
        32.  /dev/sdc (/dev/sdc0):  The third (detected) SCSI drive.
        ...and so on.

                NOTE THE CHANGES TO DIFFERENTIATE MOUSE TYPES!
                (Please implement these in the distributions.)
        0.  /dev/logibm:  Logitec-'compatible' bus mouse
        1.  /dev/psaux:  PS/2 mouse port (may not work on some lap-tops, yet)
        2.  /dev/inportbm:  MicroSoft "InPort" bus mouse
        3.  /dev/atibm:  ATI XL bus mouse

 11.  CD-ROM ........  (block) ......  scd[0-1]
        0.  /dev/scd0:  The first (detected) SCSI CD-ROM.
        1.  /dev/scd1:  The second (detected) SCSI CD-ROM.
        ("There's not much more to it than that" says Eric Youngdale.)

 12.  QIC-tape? .....  (character) ..  rmt{8,16} tape<{-d,-reset}>
     (I really don't have much info on this one... )

(VI.06)  (Chuck Boyer) Could some one clear up the devices meaning?
===================================================================

   ANSWER: (Jim Winstead Jr)

>port

   This allows programs to access the hardware ports directly.  Not
something you generally mess around with much.

>ptyp0-3
>ptypa...tty

   These are the pseudo-tty 'master' devices.  Each pty connection uses
a slave-master set of tty devices.

>tty0...

   tty[1-8] are the virtual consoles associated with Alt-F[1-8].  tty0
is the current virtual console (so writing something to tty0 goes to the
current vc).

>tty64 I've figured out is the modem connection

   Yes, that would correspond to COM1 under DOS.  However, the tty64
name is obsolete - ttys[1-4] should be used instead.

>ttyp0...
>ttypa...

   These are the pseudo-tty 'slave' devices.

>ttys1...

   These are the serial devices.  ttys1 corresponds to COM1 under DOS,
ttys2 corresponds to COM2, etc.

Douglas E. Quale:

   This has come up a couple of times already (including the case of
serial mice as well), but for the record stty acts on stdin not stdout.
Old stty's (from V7 through BSD4.3) used stdout, but this is
suboptimal and doesn't conform to POSIX.  The GNU stty you are likely
using on Linux uses stdin, as does the stty distributed with BSD
Networking Release 2.  (Also, "stty -a" is more informative about
possible parameters, although it's pretty hard for me to remember what
90% of that stuff does without refering to the man page.)

Jim Gifford:

   However, there are a few older (of mysterious origin) stty's that
work on stdout(I have one myself!)

(VI.07)  Is there a list somewhere where I can get help with serial communications under Linux?
===============================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Jim Gifford - jgifford@world.std.com)

   There is a list for the discussion of serial communications under
Linux.  It is for problems, drivers, new developments, etc... with the
Linux serial devices. The list is: linux-serial@stolaf.edu To join,
send mail to linux-serial-request@stolaf.edu I hope that this list will
prove beneficial to the improvement of Linux. This list is maintained

=====================================================================================================================

   ANSWER: Nothing, you just need to create /usr/spool/uucp (kermit
4.6?) or /usr/spool/locks (this is for the kermit5A), which is where
kermit like to lock files.

(VI.10)  can anyone give me a sample /etc/inittab entry for login from a pc attached to serial line /dev/ttys2?
===============================================================================================================

   ANSWER: "Humberto speaking :), updated by Rick Miller"

   First set up the modem to turn off echo and enable auto answer, I do
this in kermit by connecting to the modem and typing "ate0s0=1"
followed by enter (w/o quotes). Then setup inittab to spawn getty on
the modem

        ttys2:vt100:/etc/getty -m 1200 ttys2

(Replace "vt100" with the name of the /etc/termcap entry for the
terminal type you will use, or use "dumb" if you don't have one.)

   Then it should work. Some modems can be permanently set to disable
echo and set auto answer, see your manual.

Jim Weigand says:      disable all messages. This will prevent getty
from hanging up    your modem.

        Set       For:
        ATE0      No echo
        ATQ1      No messages
        ATS0=2    Answer 2nd ring
        ATS7=60   1 minute to answer (shorter if 2400 baud)

You can use kermit to set these. Do an AT&W to save for power-up.

Michael K. Johnson says:

   If you would rather not save these commands as defaults to come up
on power-up, perhaps because you want to use your current modem
settings under a DOS communications package, you can also shove these
command out ttys? from /etc/rc (or /etc/rc.local) using the command:

           echo "<modem_settings>" > /dev/ttys?

(VI.11)  How do I set parameters like parity for serial login?
==============================================================

   ANSWER: Use stty and redirect input from the serial line.  ex: stty
parodd < /dev/ttys2 which gives ttys2 odd parity.  type stty -a to get
an idea of possible parameters.  Or 'man stty' as well :)

(VI.12)  (Juha Ursin) I run SLS pl6, kernel is pl8 and I use libc.4.3.2. Trying to allow login on my terminal (on ttyS1 with only three wires (RX, TX, GND) connected). Getty 9600 /dev/ttyS1 starts and I get the login prompt, but the password prompt newer appears.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Ted Ts'o)

   Setting CLOCAL is the correct way to solve this -- it is not a bug in
the kernel.  Since you only have three wires connected, it means that
the carrier detect line was left floating, and probably floated to
ground.  Thus, the /dev/ttyS1 device blocked waiting for carrier detect
to go high.  The reason why the login prompt appeared is that getty
opened /dev/ttyS1 with the NODELAY flag; but when /dev/ttyS1 was
reopened for /bin/login, it did not have the NODELAY flag, and you ended
up blocking.

   That's what the CLOCAL flag is for -- it indicates that the serial
port is hooked up to a local (hence CLOCAL) terminal, and so the carrier
detect line should be ignored.  In general, whenever the carrier detect
line is not supported by a serial device, or if your RS-232 cable does
not support the CD wire, the CLOCAL flag should be set.

(VI.13)  (Juha) Where are my Call-out-mode -serial ports (cuaX) ?, When should I use these cuaX ports ?, Why on my system ttys3 is used instead of ttyS3 ?
==========================================================================================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Ted) Ask the person who created the install procedure (Peter
MacDonald, in the case of SLS).

>When should I use these cuaX ports?

   When you're dialing out (i.e., kermit, cu, seyon, uucp, etc.).

>On my configuration ttyS3 is named ttys3 incorrectly - why?

   Again, see the person who created the install procedure.  Recent
versions of SLS create the serial devices using the new convention
(ttyS3).  ttys3 represents an older convention, and some older install
procedures may not have switched over.

(VI.14)  (Juhan) What other possibly free IRQ's there are than IRQ5 ?, Can I use IRQ7 when not printing ?,
==========================================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Ted) IRQ 2 is also often free, although some networking
cares use them.

> Can I use IRQ 7 when not printing?

   It's generally a bad idea to have two cards plugged in sharing an IRQ
address.  It happens to work with most serial cards, but it doesn't
alwas work.  You can use IRQ 7 if you don't have a parallel port plugged
into your system.  If you do have a parallel port plugged in, you can
try using IRQ 7; it might work, it might not.  Be sure to also make sure
that the printer works after you plug in your serial card configured to
use IRQ 7.  Another alternative: If you are using the version of the
parallel printer driver that doesn't use interrupts, you can go to your
parallel port board, and disable the IRQ, thus freeing IRQ 7.

   Is pin 1 nearest to the plate or is it 31?

   If this is a sample PC ISA card, then A1 is the pin closest the
"back" of the card, and on the top, if the pins are held down and the
"back" of the card is to your right:

(VII.01)  How can I backup my Hd under Linux ?
==============================================

   ANSWER: I know at least two ways. One possibility is tar and mtools,
another possibility is the diskbackup/diskrestore of Diamano Bolla
(digest37 vol. #2) which saves big hd to floppies using the
stdin/stdout. These utilities have been uploaded to the major sites in
file disksplit.tar.Z.  An example usage (Roger Binns) is:

     tar cvf - bin dev usr etc .. | compress | diskbackup

and to restore:

     diskrestore | uncompress | tar xvf -

   BTW: if you are on Ethernet you could send your files via tar..|rsh
(tar...) or even via NFS to a host which is regularly backed up !

(VII.02)  Where is 'which' ?
============================

   ANSWER: It depends on the sh you are running:

     in bash         'type -path'
     in tcsh         it's a builtin

for rc you can try the following (untested by me) script from Kevin
Brown:

     #!/bin/sh
     for i in `echo $PATH | sed 's/:/ /g'` ; do
       for j in ""$@" ; do
             if test -x "$i/$j" ; then
                echo "$i/$j"
              fi

(VII.03)  How to use setterm: for the novice?
=============================================

   ANSWER:The setterm utility provides access to most of Virtual
Consoles (VCs) functionality.  You can set your screen up to blank at 10
minutes using:

                     setterm -blank 10

   You can set colors, and clear the screen.  For a full list of
commands, just type "setterm" with no arguments.

   There are a few tricks with the screen dumper can really make VCs go
a long way.  Here are a few of the common ones that I use:

                     setterm dump

   Dumps the contents of the current VC to screen.dump (in the current
dir).

                     setterm dump 4

   Dumps the contents of VC 4 to screen.dump

                     setterm -file mydumpfile -dump 4

   Dump the contents of VC 4 to the file mydumpfile

                     setterm -file /dev/tty0 -dump 4

   Dumps the contents of VC 4 to the current VC.

                     setterm -file /dev/tty4 -dump

   Dumps the contents of the current VC to VC 4.

                     setterm -file /dev/ttys1 -dump

   Dumps the contents of the current VC to the serial port.  Handy if
you are logged on and want to paste a screen full without having to
resort to doing a file transfer.

                     setterm -file mydumpfile -append 4

   Appends to instead of overwriting the dump file.  Useful if you have
several screens you wish to concatenate.

For clear, you can also write a small script (which use the cl: part of
/etc/termcap wrt your TERM), or use bash where ctrl-l will do it for
you.

(VII.06)  I know there are shared libraries; does there exist an easy way to check an executable for sharing ?
==============================================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Claude Morin:) There exists at tsx-11 ldd.tar.Z If you
follow the instructions, you will be able to type "ldd <executable>" to
List the Dynamic Dependencies of the executables. In other words 'ldd'
prints the name of the shared libraries needed by the executable,
nothing appears for static one.

   ANSWER: (Josh Yelon & HJ Lu) - very old binaries.

   (J.Y.) An executable which shares a library is linked with an
(ordinary, non-shared) "stub" version of the library. One of the first
thing this stub does (when the executable is run) is to ask the kernel
to load the (big) "shared version" of the library (which is usually
named /lib/lib.XX.XX) The upshot of this is that in the code for the
stub (part of the executable), is the string "/lib/lib.XX.XX"; which
can be searched by using 'strings' or 'grep'.

   (HJ. L.) if you have gcc2.11a or later the shared image is changed to
/lib/libxxxx_vyy_zzz. And you should better use nm to find
"__shared_lib" (nm failed on stripped executable). You can also write a
function for "file", which can even check the version number ....

boot-image, it prints the device configured as the root device, and
with two arguments, a boot image and a device, it sets the device as
default root in the specified image.

(VII.08)  How to start Linux from drive B?
==========================================

   ANSWER: There is a DOS utility called boot_b.exe (look at DOS ftp).
Another simple way is to open the box and invert the cables.

(VII.09)  The program boot_b works fine /but/ once the first disk is read the system go back to the first drive, any hints?
===========================================================================================================================

   ANSWER: Yes, change the bootimage in just the same way that you
change it to boot on the hard drive, execept that the major/minor pair
is different. All these information are in the file INSTALL-0.10.
Remember that if you use a sun or other endian machine, you will need
to reverse the byte order when you run the filter program (also in the
same file).

(VII.10)  How can I get Linux to boot directly from the harddisk?
=================================================================

   ANSWER: (Rick) The best option right now is LILO version ALPHA.8. It
has been generally agreed that the days of using "shoelace" are at an
end. See Section III of this FAQ for LILO information.

(VII.11)  I use shoelace, but I want to change my root partition, what is the process to get rid of it?
=======================================================================================================

   ANSWER: With Norton utility you can put back a standard boot sector.
Another possibility is to restore the old boot sector (the one you
should have backup *before* installing shoelace).

on another VC whose working directory is either the one you try to
remove, either a subdirectory of it.

(VII.13)  I'm looking for init, getty, login, passwd stuff, where can I find them?
==================================================================================

   ANSWER: You should find it in shadow.tar.Z (only sources), at least
at tsx in the usr.bin directory. Many people have reported some troubles
with the *OLD* shadow-passwd (shadow-bin.tar.Z and shadow-src.tar.Z, so
do not use them anymore); an alternative might be the mcc-interim which
contains standard passwd binary. There is also the Peter Orbaek's
admutil-1.?.tar.Z and poeigl-1.?.tar.Z which contains source for
shutdown, su, chsh, passwd and a system V init compatible.

(VII.14)  How can I setup a user account other than root ?
==========================================================

   ANSWER: You can either use the adduser program, either do it
manually.  In the later case, you have to:

   a) edit /etc/passwd as root and add a line of the following format:

     user:passwd:uid:gid:user name:home directory:login shell

user is the login name; uid is the numeric user id, it should be
unique; gid is the numeric group id, this number should correspond to
an entry in /etc/group. The passwd field should be left blank 'cause it
is stored in an encrypted form [to set this field just use the passwd
program].

     example
     faq::200:5:Marc-Michel:/home/faq:/bin/sh

   b) Still as root, you shoud now create the home directory and set the
correct ownership.

     mkdir /home/faq
     chown faq /home/faq
     chgrp 5 /home/faq

(VII.15)  I've been trying to get Linux to run on my [3/4]86 box. It can't even boot. Any suggestions?
======================================================================================================

   ANSWER: The most common error/problem is writing the bootimage to a
low density disk. It fits, but the bootstrap code will only recognize
high density disk. So try to format explicitely disk as high density:

     - for 3.5",  'format a: /n:18 /t:80 '
     - for 5.25", 'format a: /n:15 /t:80 '

( VII.17)  Whenever I use uemacs 3.1X on a symlink, the symlink does not exist anymore, why?
============================================================================================

   ANSWER: (Tristram Mabbs) Since ue3.10, uemacs uses 'safe save' mode,
writing the file to a temporary and moving it OVER the original. In the
process, this deletes the original. To prevent this just add the
following in your emacs '.rc' file: set $ssave FALSE

(VII.18)  I have an SVGA, but Linux detect an EGAc/EGAm; is it normal?
======================================================================

   ANSWER: (Jim Winstead) This is correct actually. You have an EGA+
card (SVGA) with a Color/Mono monitor. The only four possibilties are
EGAc, EGAm, *MDA and *CGA (according to the code in
kernel/chr_drv/console.c).

   The true test, if Linux detects your video card, is if you press
<RETURN> at the "Press <RETURN> to see SVGA- ..." boot-time message.
If you have a SVGA  recognized card, it will ask you to choose a screen
size. If not detected, the default is 80x50 mode.  BTW if you have no
SVGA, press the <space> and you are in 80x25 mode.

   If you have dowloaded the kernel, you can automatically skip this
query at boot-time if you set the SVGA_MODE variable in the main
Makefile before compiling a new bootimage.

(VII.19)  How can I change the keyboard repeat rate?
====================================================

   ANSWER: (Michael K Johnson) In boot/setup.S there are the lines:

     ! set the keyboard repeat rate to max
             mov     ax,#0x0305
             mov     bx,0x0000
             int     0x16

   If you don't want to change the repeat rate at all, just comment out
these lines. If you want something in the middle, change the

             mov     bx,0x000
     by      mov     bx,0x??yy
     where ??yy is determined by (Ralf Brown's interrupt list)
     bh= delay value (0x00 = 250ms to 0x03= 1000ms (one sec))
             this is the delay before the repeat is performed
     bl= repeat rate (0x00 =30/sec to 0x1f=2/sec; 0x0c=10/sec [default])

(VII.20)  I compiled fdformat.c and ran it on 1.44Mb and 1.2Mb, the results are unreadable, any clue?
=====================================================================================================

   ANSWER: (M. Pereckas) fdformat only low-level formats the disk. to
use the fdformatted disk with DOS filesystem, run mformat on the disk.
Mformat writes DOS filesystem information but is unable to low-format
:). In order to put a Linux filesystem on a (low)formatted disk you
have to mkfs it.

> serial port at 0x03f8 is a 16450
> serial port at 0x02f8 is a 16450 (what's that the uart chip?)

   Right, the last number should either be 8250, 16450, 16550, or
16550a, and on the two 16550 models, it will report that FIFO's have
been disable (16550) or enabled (16550a).

> 8 virtual consoles (that's how many alt-F's I can get going?
>      but only F1-4 actually work)

   You can get sessions running on Alt-F[1-8], but the 'standard'
/etc/inittab only runs getty/login on Alt-F[1-4].  You can start
sessions on the other consoles by using 'doshell' or adding lines to
/etc/inittab.

> 4 pty's (are these the consoles F1-4?)

   No, those are 'pseudo' ttys, which programs like MGR use to simulate
tty connections.  That's probably a gross over-simplification, but it
gives you the general idea, I think.  :)

> p_init: lp1 exists (0) (is that the (l)ine (p)rinter?)

   Right.

(VII.23)  What is the meaning of files ended by .T.Z (or .taz) ?
================================================================

   ANSWER: The suffix Z is for compressed files (to uncompress them use
the command `uncompress file.Z`).  The suffix T indicates a "tar file"
the usual suffix is tar but, the 14 chars filename limit of the Minix
filesystem makes it cumbersome to use .tar.Z (to untar a file ended by
.T, use the command `tar options file.T` (see the man page for more
details).

   For the .taz file, change them as .T.Z and go-ahead.
