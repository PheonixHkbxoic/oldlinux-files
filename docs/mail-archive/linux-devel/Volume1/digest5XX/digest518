 Hello,

    I guess I had put my question incorrectly earlier.  I will try again.
        I am writing a daemon process to write some data into a file on the disk.
        Since the application is time critical, I don't want toi make any system
        call, `read`, `write`, `open` etc.  The easiest thing would be directly
        call the function which is called by filesystem's  `read` call handler
        [struct file_operations.read()...].  To do this I my daemon needs to have
        a pointer to the actual inode structure for the file.

        I hope this time I am much more clear than before. Now, can anybody help me?

        Daemon process does have root privileges and everything I have said, meant or
        would like know is in the context of Linux OS.

        thanks again for your time and replies.

        sincerely,

[...]

I'm afraid you (that is most or all of you, not only John F. Haugh II)
are overlooking an important aspect: You only consider the definition of
"derivative", but forget the definition of "work". 

I doubt that a driver that needs to be linked (even at runtime) into the
Linux kernel is itself a "work".

The driver can't be produced except as a part of a Linux kernel + driver
combination. Don't tell me you can write such a driver without testing
by compiling it, linking it into the kernel, and running it as part of a
modified Linux kernel. And the driver can't be used except as a part of
a Linux kernel + driver combination.

So the "work" is the modified kernel, and the driver is just a part of
this "work", so it is affected by the copyright of the whole "work",
even if you distribute only this part. The driver author first creates
the complete "work" (modified kernel), and it is in this case covered by
the GPL, because it is obviously derived from the GPL'd Linux kernel
(obvious because it contains Linus' code). Taking one .o file from this
"work" won't change the legal status of this part.

This is where a defined, public interface makes a difference. With a
public interface, you _use_ the original "work" instead of _modifying_
it, so the code using the original "work" can itself be another "work".


BTW, I think your definition of "derive" is too narrow. IMHO there are
other ways of "deriving" besides actually copying source code. It e.g.
can be enough if you only take over major principles or ideas (as with
Apple and the idea of the trash can on your desktop). (This doesn't mean
that I like the general current legal status of software.)


All this doesn't depend on the wording of the GPL and of RMS' (or Linus'
or whoever's) interpretation, but only on the copyright laws. And of
course a final decision can only be made in court. (Let's hope this
won't be necessary.)

Given that the reason Amiga disks can not be read under MS-DOS is
hardware related, this is irrelevent. Obviously an Amiga disk reader
under MS-DOS, were it to exist, wouldn't be an alternate filesystem.

Well, I can only say that I *never, ever* saw a board running faster with  
external cache disabled. Quite to the contrary, each and every one were a  
lot smaller.

That is, unless the cache rams were defect, of course. Then it doesn't run

Basically if you have to program the DMA controller more than once every 4K
of transfers, the overhead is too much(1).  There are often-winning (2) ways
to use DMA for small or random-sized transfers, like ethernet packets.  One
way is to make them look like big transfers.  The i82593 ethernet controller
uses two DMA channels, both configured as recirculating ring buffers.
Received packets are stored one after another another in the ring, with the
host resetting the Rx stop pointer after it removes each packet.  The LANCE
ethernet controller uses another approach: becoming a bus master.  In this
mode the LANCE uses the DMA controller to take over the bus, but doesn't use
the DMA address generation.

(1) Exceptions to this are devices that want data annoyingly infrequently
and don't have any buffer space of their own.  The floppy controller uses
DMA for this reason -- it wants a byte every 4 to 16 usec., which is too
short to take an interrupt but too long to just busy loop.

(2) I say "often-winning" because even the best DMA device is not always a
win.  Some processors will flush their cache after every DMA cycle, which
slows the processor down much more than if it had done the transfer itself.

____
A few other nice features a device should have:

It should be easy to safely probe for a device.  The scheme used on the
3c509 is a good solution for the ISA bus.

Once a device is found it's nice to be able to read the resources
(IRQ, DMA, and shared memory) that the card wants or is already using.

A device should never hold the bus for an indefinite time if data isn't
ready to be transferred.  The NE*000 will hang the machine if you access its
dataport and it's not set up to do a data transfer.  A more robust solution
is to set an 'underrun' error bit and return invalid data.

Make it possible to power down the device if it's not being used.  The
ethercard drivers take care to put the devices into low-power mode at boot
and close() time.  In the case of an ISDN card you should have a
just-barely-awake mode as well as a asleep-and-deaf-to-the-world mode.

No way.  With _several_ different clone motherboards running SCO Unix
and DOS I performed similar tests turning cache's on and off, Pulling
Cache RAM chips and the like. 

In _EVERY_ instance turning on the external cache improved performance
DRAMATICALLY.  And caches above 64K had a MUCH more significant effect
under SCO than DOS (18% improvements vs 5%), and became even more
significant when Load Averages went above 1.00 (As high as 50% 64K vs
256K running compute intensive awk script).

A 486/33 with no external cache and 8MB RAM is darn near unusable under
SCO, (basically with more than one user).

Once we passed the 25Mhz mark multi-way memory interleaving doesn't hold
a candle to a half-assed cache.  Running similar tests under Xenix on
20/25Mhz 386 boxes did not show much of a difference, and in fact some
of the cache stuff _was_ slower.  Now most everyone is using the same
chipsets, so it doesn't much matter.
