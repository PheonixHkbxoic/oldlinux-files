        ELF is supported but it only works for staticly linked binaries.  It is
only the shared library support that is missing.  Without it, very few people
would be willing to switch.

        Quite true.  I am developing a libc.so.1 for SVr4 binaries under linux,
and it needs to be compiled and linked under SVr4.

        There are lots of things that need to be done.  I started in a week
ago, just to get a feel for what would be needed.  I am enclosing a list,
and I have indicated the stuff that I have already done.  Some of it is bfd
and some of it is ld proper, and my main complaint is that bfd programs are
very hard to trace because they jump all over the place through dispatch
tables.  Also, ld now uses a scripting language, and to really see what is
going on you almost need to study the parser to see what is is likely to want
to do.

Remove stuff from existing sections that does not belong at all.  Stuff with
"*" has been done already.

* 1) Allow sharable images to be loaded, mark as DYNAMIC.
* 2) Set SHARED_LIBRARY bit for all symbols from the sharable libraries.
* 3) Do not copy sections (i.e. text) from sharable libraries.
  4) Remove all sharable library symbols from the symtab.

Add new sections to the image to hold stuff required for dynamic linking.

  5) For images linked to sharable images, add the reference to the
        program interpreter.  Add .interp section to hold this.
  6) Generate a _DYNAMIC section, put it somewhere (at the end of
        .text??).  Initially this section would be empty, but create primatives
        to add entries.  Add this to the program header.
  7) For each sharable image, add the DT_NEEDED entry in _DYNAMIC so that
        the dynamic linker knows which sharable images are needed.
  8) Generate the second symtab which contains the symbols needed for
        dynamic linking.  Generate the second string table which contains the
        symbols for dynamic linking (.dynsym, .dynstr).
  9) Generate the hash table, and generate the buckets and chains needed
        to describe all of the symbols in the new symbol table.  Add reference
        to this in _DYNAMIC (.hash).

 10) Generate the PLT for this image for referenaces to sharable
        functions.  (.plt).
 11) Generate the relocation section (.rel.plt) for references to
        sharable functions.  Add appropriate pointers to _DYNAMIC.

 12) Generate GOT for references to objects in the sharable images.
        Add (.got) section to hold this.
 13) Generate the relocation section (.rel) for references to non
        function stuff.  Add appropriate pointers to _DYNAMIC.

 14) Ancillary project - fix up binutils as required.

Is there a driver available or in development that FULLY supports
the capabilities of this card.  It's work well with AHA1540 emulation
but I imagine, I won't get the performance of a BusLogic VLB driver.

Thanks,

        Amiga FLOPPY drives (not the disks) are different than PC floppy
drives, and I suppose that the PC's floppy controller might be incapable of
reading floppy disks in Amiga format. But if you have an Amiga *HARD* drive
there will be no difference between the drive & controller itself and a
standard PC unit.

        The one other choice someone with an Amiga has is to use the C=
supplied (or PD) software that lets the Amiga read & write MS-DOS format
disks transparently. I guess you could also get the Amiga version of "tar",
and use the raw floppy device to create a TAR diskette that Linux could read...

Hmmmm, didn't think about that.  I know there is a version of Minix for
the Amiga.  I don't have it so haven' tried it out, but that might be
another way to do it.

Is it possible to read in a raw image of a floppy on a PC (w/o gaps)
so you could create say a ramdisk image of the floppy, and then via
software manipulate this to get to Amiga files?  It wouldn't be too
efficient, but would allow access to the files.

So why do you not put your $25 where your mouth is and take a copy of the
GPL and GLPL, and ask your local Supreme Court to provide an interpretation
for you?

The entire GPL/GLPL is quite straightforward and means just about
precicisely what it says.  If you get a good dictionary of the English
Language (English, not American or Canadian, but ENGLISH), and look up the
EXACT AND PRECISE meaning of every single word in the license, you will find

The problem is the number of numbnuts that do not even know the meaning of

they could merely understand the Kings' English!

Oh, no... don't bother.
I'm sure the Specialix people have long turned away from even considering

hmm, i dopn't know which capabilities from your bt445s you're missing.

with my 486/dx2-66, the bt445s and a fast disk I got up to 5.5MB/sec
sustained ftransfer rate with both the aha1542 and and the bt445 driver 
for Linux.

maybe you only need a faster disk?

When I run the program at the command line prompt, it immediately exits

For about six months I've been running the STB 4-Com (as another
poster noted, it's $27.50 retail per port, $110 at places like Computer
City).  In a recent conversation with the vendor, though, I was informed
that this is the end of the line for STB's comm adapters--they are
devoting engineering resources to graphics adapters.  So while I really
like the STB--it works with Ted Ts'o's device driver out-of-the-box,
don't expect to be able to increase your dialup pool beyond 8 ports
with this product (you get 8 different I/O port address selections via
jumpers on this board, so you can install two of them and that's it.)

I bought a Gtek BBS550 8-port card and found that it kinda limps along with
the stock serial driver.  Am now awaiting a device-driver diskette from
the vendor (they do support Linux.)  The price of this card is $35 per
port ($279) from the place I bought it; all ports have full 10-wire modem
control.

Boca has come out with full modem control 8- and 16-port cards.  I'll be
looking into those soon.

With these products on the market, along with cheap 486's, it's now
possible to build a full-blown Unix box with disk storage for less money
per dialup port than what terminal server vendors charge for their
products.  May I never buy another Xyplex/Xylogics/whatever unit again.

THANK YOU, Linux developers, for making all the comm stuff work well
enough to replace terminal servers.
