I am trying to track down a problem with emacs-19.22 on linux-1.0.  It
seems that signal-process is not working.  For example, in shell mode
using \C-c\C-c doesn't work.

I traced the problem to this.  tcgetpgrp on the master pty returns
ENOTTY.  Does anyone know why?

The X/Open Portability Guide version 3 says:

#include <nl_types.h>
int catclose(nl_catd catd);

Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned

  No errors are defined.

Its probably a good idea to follow this ;-)

Is anyone working on a driver for the VL-300 SCSI, IDE, floppy, ser,
par, games combo card?

I have heard that it sort of works with the current (0.99.15 or 1.0)
kernel, but that there are known timing problems with adaptec 6360 chips
on local bus boards.

I've got a SCSI disk (Maxtor XT-4380S) and a SCSI tape (Archive Viper
2150S) just waiting for a SCSI controller to be installed.  I've also
got a VL-300 board on loan from someone who doesn't need it anymore (he
bought a Buslogic 545 to replace it with).

I've got the VL-300 working from my 1MB dos partition (big enough to
run acidwarp is all the DOS disk that I need), but would like to get it
running with Linux...even if I can't get a hard disk to work reliably
with the card for the moment, it sure would be handy to be able to back
up my ESDI hard disk with the Viper tape drive.

I'll be installing 1.0 in a few days - as soon as I get GCC 2.5.8 and
libc 4.5.21 installed.  With luck I might be able to get the tape drive
working under Linux.

I'd appreciate it if anyone could email me with details of exactly why
it doesn't work, and a best-guess as to when a driver might be ready for
it.  Don't post, send email and I will summarise to the net.

Thanks.

I am involved with SHARE Europe (one of the IBM user groups) and some of the
IBM people attending are from the development laboratories.  If anyone is
seriously interested in doing a Power PC port and has had difficulties in
getting hold of particular answers, documentation references etc., I may
be able to find out.  Please send me a message if you are in this position.

Even better, why not come to SHARE Europe (in Brussels from April 18th to
21st) and ask for yourself?  Unfortunately, I cannot pretend that it is
cheap, but it is a very interesting conference and covers a lot of areas.
If anyone in Europe is attempting this task and is interested in talking
about it at some later meeting, please contact me - it is sometimes possible
to reduce the costs for speakers.

No guarantees, of course, on either point :-)

Owen is preparing a new MCC system based on version 1 of the kernel and I

If you feel you *must* release your version I suggest that you don't use any

This sounds a lot like a problem I have with my Future Domain 1670 card.  It 
worked fine under DOS and Linux on my old 386 system but with neither on my
new Gateway P5/60. Future Domain eventually provided me with a v3.4 BIOS ROM 
to solve the problem for DOS/Windows but Linux still reports no SCSI devices

Yes, NIS is (partially) supported. There is support in libc and
there are client programs (ypbind, ypwich etc.) You can find them
on ftp.uni-paderborn.de in /pub/linux/local/yp/yp-linux.tar.gz. 
libc-4.5.21 or above should be used.

Hope this helps

Subject: Proposal - Coordinating bug fixes with enhancements.
From: hjstein@sunset.huji.ac.il (Harvey J. Stein)
Date: 22 Mar 94 18:31:41


Does anyone have any ideas on how to coordinate bug fixes with
enhancements for the Linux kernel?  The problem is as follows.

I run Linux at home & am also responsible for the computing at work,
so at work I set up 7 Linux machines, 5 of which are 486DX2-66s.

At home, I always want to try out the newest kernel as soon as a
feature comes out that I'd been waiting for.  At work, however, I want
to wait untill the kernel's been hammered on for awhile so I can feel
more sure that I won't burn the disks and crash the net.

The way I see it, there are two general classes of changes that are
made, namely bug fixes & enhancements.  To the extent that these don't
overlap, I have no problem upgrading machines at work with kernels
that have recent bug fixes, but I'd like to hold off on the patch
levels that have the major enhancements.  Unfortunately, there's no
way of telling which kernels have major enhancements and which only
have bug fixes.

I loved the way V1.0 was handled.  Since all the enhancements were
going into the pl14 alpha kernels, and only bug fixes were going into
the pl15 kernels, until it became V1.0, I knew that (for the office) I
should stay away from upgrades until V1.0.

So, I'd like to know what people think about continuing with this
procedure.  We could alternate releases between enhancement releases &
bug fix releases.  At home I can get kernels when the enhancement I've
been dying for gets in, and at work I could wait until the last
bug-fix kernel.

My idea is to use a version number scheme that basically marks where
the enhancements occur.  It wouldn't be so different than the current
method of numbered & lettered patch levels, except that there would be
meaning in when the numbers & letters change.

We could keep track of enhancements versus bug fixes by having
versions consisting of four numbers (like internet addresses).  We'd
have Linux Version a.b.c.d, where c & d would be left out when they're
zero.  The meaning would be as in the following example:

Version     Status
1.0       Major release (only bug fixes).
1.0.0.1   Enhancement added.
1.0.0.2   Bug fix.
1.0.0.3   Bug fix.
1.0.0.4   Bug fix.
1.0.1     Last minor release before new enhancement (could be the same
          as version 1.0.0.4).
1.0.1.1   Enhancement added.
1.0.1.2   Bug fix.
1.0.1.3   Bug fix.
1.0.1.4   Bug fix.
1.0.1.5   Bug fix.
1.0.2     Minor release, only bug fixes, could be same as 1.0.1.5
 .
 .
 .
1.1       Major release.

If people don't like so many numbers (and I must admit, that I don't
either), we could do something like what we do now, having
pl<number><letter>, if we follow some convention of what the numbers
and letters stand for.  Maybe pl<number> would be a minor release,
just including bug fixes, pl<number><letter> would represent an
enhancement when <letter> is a-l & bug fixes only from m-z, so that
pl<n+1> is the same as pl<n><letter>, where <letter> is the last
kernel in the pl<n> series, after bug fixes have been going in for
afew lettered releases.

Or, we could use even and odd.  Even numbered patch levels could be
the kernels where enhancements go, and odd numbered patch levels could
be bug fix only kernels.  I think I like this last alternative the best.

If people want to make this even stronger, they could even do as was
done with version 1.0, namely having well defined times where
enhancements are allowed in.

So, what do people think about this?

It's because linux doesn't always keep the screen in the beginning of the 32k
of videomemory. Try this:


#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include <fcntl.h>

                ::"a" ((char) value),"d" ((unsigned short) port));
}

inline static unsigned char inb(unsigned short port)
{
        unsigned char _v;
__asm__ volatile ("inb %1,%0"
                :"=a" (_v):"d" ((unsigned short) port));
        return _v;
}

int main()
{
        int mem_fd,i;
        char *graph_mem,*scr;

        if ((mem_fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR) ) < 0) {
                perror("Can't open /dev/mem");
                exit(1);
        }

        graph_mem = (char *)
          mmap( (caddr_t)0, GRAPH_SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, mem_fd, GRAPH_BASE);
        if ((long)graph_mem < 0) {
                perror("mmap error"); 
                exit(1);
        }

        if (ioperm(0x3d4, 2, 1)) {
                perror("Can't get i/o permissions");
                exit(1);
        }
        outb(0x3d4,12); i=inb(0x3d5)<<8;
        outb(0x3d4,13); i+=inb(0x3d5);
        scr=&graph_mem[i+i];    /* Find current screen location in the 32k area at 0xb8000 */

        memset(scr,'A',80);     /* Put 40 A's in horrible colors on the top row */

        exit(0);
}

Please don't assume that the screen is 80x25!

Under SunOS 4.1.3, if you try to mount a floppy that is write protected
the mount will fail unless you have the -r option on your mount command.
Maybe this is the way it should be approached with Linux.

I believe this is already being planned nicely with the separate
 "hackers-paradise" version and "stable" release version...

   as for problems with Linux... only a few corrupted files on my
   MSDOS mounted partition have affected me. (well, there WAS that

Yes, you are crazy. For a start memory management is not supported on any of the
current transputers, and of course the transputer is a entirely different
architecture to any Intel processor. Unix on transputers? Well there have been
attempts, but first of all I recommend you read up on the transputer, try
'The Transputer Handbook' by Ian Graham & Tim King (ISBN 0-13-929134-2). It
contains a broad overview of transputers/ transputer systems both hardware and
software. If you're still crazy after that, then I recommend you see a doctor,
and if that doesn't help, then I'll probably join you in your madness ;-)
Good Luck.
