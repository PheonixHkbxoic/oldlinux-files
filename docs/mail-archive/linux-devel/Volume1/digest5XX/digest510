Isn't that good enough?! The driver source (i.e. the important stuff) is 
public, the download code is not (it might not even be 386 code, probably 
isn't, so why even bother about it). The driver source is a part of Linux, 
even if they released the download code source, it still would NOT be part 
of Linux. Heck Specialix's only mistake was asking the net, instead of going 
ahead and just doing it. 1/2 :)

I'm using a version of affs in linux/68k to read AmigaDOS hard disk

   I've been wrestling with the linux 0.99.15 serial driver for a couple of
   days now with limited success.  I would appreciate hearing from others
   who have delved into the serial/tty/ns16550a morass.

What version of 0.99.15 are you using?

   Here are my findings, in no particular order:

   * I found at least three bugs in the calculation & deployment of
     rs_timer() timeouts, with the net result that timeouts intended to
     happen within a few jiffies don't happen for 60 seconds!  When an
     interrupt is lost (and they are lost with some frequency), the
     driver waits all that time before things start up again.  I
     discovered this after noting that uucp performance on my 14,400bps
     modem (with 16550a UART) was miserable due to 60 second dry-spells
     in transmission every 20-30Kb transferred.  I fixed this, and got a
     significant improvement, but other problems still exist...

Can you send a patch?  A visual inspection of the code seems to indicate
that it should be doing the right thing.  I have missed something,
though.

   * The code sets the 16550A FIFO trigger at 8 bytes.  This appears to
     work for receive interrupts, but not for transmit--I always observe an
     interrupt per character on transmissions.

(1) the FIFO trigger level only applies for the receive interrupts.  (2)
for the transmit interupts, the THRE bit is only set when the FIFO is
*empty*, and the serial driver is programmed to load 16 bytes at a time
into the UART if the FIFO mode is set.  This is as specified by the
National Semincoductor databook.  If you're UART is doing something
else, it's broken.

So I question your observations.  If THRE is really getting set once per
character, you would also be losing 15 out of every 16 characters.  I'm
pretty sure it's doing the right thing.

   * The UART seems to require a "cooling off" period after servicing the
     interrupt, before the interrupt handler can return--I have to poll
     until the UART_IIR_NO_INT bit is set before returning.  It usually
     takes at least a couple times around the service loop, after all I/O
     has been performed and there's nothing left to do, before the bit
     comes on.  Sometimes, it takes a dozen loops before the bit comes
     on!  This is neither here-nor-there, I just find it curious
     behavior, and, of course, it would be nice if the interrupt could be
     serviced faster without all the thumb-twiddling at the end,

This really sounds like your UART is broken.... and is probably the
cause of your unreliable performance.  A dozen loops around the service
handler will seriously degrade your performance!

Hmm.... actually there's another explanation.  If your modem/null modem
is leaving the modem status lines (dcd, rts, ring, dsr, etc.) floating,
it could be that they are bouning up and down rapidly, causing lots of
modem status interrupts to fire.  In future versions, there will be a
patch so that if CLOCAL is on, and CRTSCTS is off, that modem status
interrupts will be disabled; but you will still lose if you need (say)
RTS/CTS flow control, but the RING line is still floating and is
oscillating rapidly between 0 and 1.

I'm lucky; I don't have that problem on my serial boards, even if
nothing's plugged into them; they just stay 0 or 1 consistently, even as
they float.

   * Is the Linux serial driver generally known to be buggy/unreliable at
     high speed, or is there something about my hardware configuration
     that's causing me problems that others don't have?

Not that I know of.  I would suspect that there's something special
about your hardware.

   * Are there multiple versions of the 16550a, some of which don't
     work--possibly like mine! :-(

There have been reports of people with cheapskate UART's that try to be
National Seimcoduct compitible, but really aren't.

Hello, I need some help.  I recently got a new Adaptec 2742T controller and sold
off my 1542B thinking I must press on with future development to stay current.
My main mission is to run Linux and I cant because it wont recognize this card.
To whoever is writing the driver (hopefully you r reading this now) could you
please give me some feedback on the status.  Thanx a lot.

        Jeez, people want performance too :-).

        Dunno about speed.  I have not specifically benchmarked anything.  In
principle, it should be about the same.  With ELF binaries, there is a slight
delay as the dynamic linker does its job, but other than this it should be
close.

        Memory usage - should also be similar I guess.  I have not really tried
to compare anything yet.

        Disk usage - COFF binaries should be pretty compact if they use the
shared library.  ELF should be somewhat larger, but I do not have a good
estimate off the top of my head as to how much larger this would be.  I would
want to say something in the 10-20% range, but I could be off.  This should be
quite close to the binary size for NetBSD with their new shared libraries.

First:

  Don't listen to us random net loonies.  We have no power to back up
  our words.


Who you _should_ listen to is people like Linus, your lawyer, and yes,
RMS and/or other _high_level_ people at the FSF.  RMS et al rarely get
into mud slinging messes like this, but it is my understanding that
they are much more reasonable/logical when you talk to them directly
than when you listen to people talking for them.  Linus has seemed to
be _very_ interested in helping people use Linux.  I have no idea how
nice your lawyer is.  :->  


You need to consider whether there is a market for your product, and
what legal i's need to be dotted and t's crossed in order for you (and
your lawyer) to feel comfortable with the product.  If you think there
is a market, the _please_ talk to the people who count.

Most PC disk drives won't read Amiga disks - I doubt an Amiga file
system would be easier to write under Linux than MS-DOS, and
"How do I read Amiga disks on a PC? - You don't, use an MS-DOS
filesystem on the Amiga" is definitely an Amiga FAQ.

I'm assuming you are talking about floppies here, not transferring
hard disks, or reading them under the Amiga Linux port.

I think Amiga disks are physically incompatible with the machines Linux
normally runs on...

   These tty bugs exist both in standard pl15h and in the new tty code by 
   tytso@athena.mit.edu.

   1. /dev/tty0 points to the vc that was active at OPEN time, not
   read/write time.

Actually, this is only in the new tty code, I believe.  Does anyone
care?

/dev/tty0 really was a mistake, especially when people used it for
/dev/console....  What I will probably do is create a new driver for
/dev/console, with a new major/minor pair.  It will be a output-only
device, and will use the console_print interface.  This will allow
/dev/console to be used for systems where the console is a serial port,
and where there may be no graphics adaptors at all.

This will also allow writes to /dev/console to always show up on the
active VC.

   2. If /dev/tty0 is the tty of the process, all access to /dev/tty
   returns ENXIO: No such device or address.
   3. If /dev/tty0 is the tty of the process, control-c, etc are IGNORED.

These are both features; /dev/tty0 is only to be used for output, and
should ***not*** be used as a controlling tty.  In fact, the code very
explicitly disallows /dev/tty0 from being a controlling tty.  This will
cause (2) and (3), as you have noted.

   This exists in the new tty code:

   4. The new tty code hoses the TTY column of procps. It shows con for
   processes with no tty, for example.

Yes, this is because the TTY column of procps is broken.  It used to
only return the minor number, which only works if you have only one
major number.  I've changed it to return full dev_t specification (i.e.,
(major << 8) + minor).

So, you'll need to fix the procps suite to handle this.

   P.S. I did send a subscribe message to the new-tty mailing list, but
   have not got a confirmation so I am sending this post here for the
   time being.  (I don't trust mailing lists too much anymore....

Yes, that's why I'm administering linux-new-tty manully.  Please be
patient; it may take a day or so before I can get to your request.

                                                - Ted

I tried ftp from anonymous@sipb.mit.edu, bot got "Anonymous ftp not allowed."
Is there another site for this, or another method at this site?

Thanks.
