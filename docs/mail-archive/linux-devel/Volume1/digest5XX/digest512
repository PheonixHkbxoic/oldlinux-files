Your .sig is not only way too big, but utterly pathetic.  What does it

           We are considering switching over from SCO Xenix to Linux, but
   have run into a snarl - it doesn't appear that Linux supports the old,
   dumb 8-port Digiboard that we currently use.

           Have I just missed it in serial.c?  Or does anybody know where
   such a beastie might be obtained?  ADVthanksANCE.

If it's a dumb digibaord (as opposed to their newer "intelligent"
boards) , the Linux serial driver will support it just fine.  Just get
the "setserial" utility from tsx-11.mit.edu, in /pub/linux/sources/sbin,
and install it on your system.  Then edit /etc/rc.serial so that the
appropriate ports and interrupts for the digiboards are configured
correctly.  It will all work!

Date: 1 Mar 1994 09:05:37 GMT

Hello World!

Yesterday I observed a problem with my Ethernet connection to our local
network. I'm not quite shure if this is related to the other network
problems reported in this group. (These were about unreachable networks
at boottime). Well, my connection comes up with no problems, with all
services running ok (I'm using the new mount)
Then, I got the message

eth0: transmit timed out, TX status 0x9c, ISR 0x0
eth0: Possible network cable problem?

After that, networking broke down and only a reboot fixed it (I tried to
re-ifconfig and re-route, but no help).
Well, first, it is *not* a cable problem, as it does not occur in pl15b.
I tried to trace a bit back and noticed that the problem arises during
heavy use of X-connections to remote hosts (I was doing Image processing
with a lot of windows opened, displaying color images and plots).
OTOH it seems not connected to the real amount of data going through
the net, as I can FTP large amounts of data without problems.
Has anyone else observed that? Where should I look to I get more info 
about the problem?
Here's my config:
486DX/2-66VL, 3com 503 Etherlink card, Slackware 1.1.0, PL15h

Regards and thanks for any hints,

  Peter

No, you've not created a derivative work.  You have made it easier for

I think that when you lose interrupts with some frequency, something
is amiss with the hardware.  Maybe you try to share interrupts using
some unreliable circuitry?  (or no circuitry at all)

I am using it at 76800 bps with a modified 16550a card, and can transfer
compressable files at 71000 bps without overrun on my 486/33 with SCSI disk.

the a-type is supposed to work.  the plain 16550 doesn't.

Subject: Reboot is being flaky..
Date: Tue, 1 Mar 94 09:24:23 GMT

I've been getting the one for a while now.  It is just getting too
annoying for me.  *grin*

When I use reboot (from SysVInit 2.4), I will sometimes get a reboot
(soft) of the computer.  Other times, it will beep a lot at me and
"lockup".  But I can still do alt-cntl-del, and it will beep a lot.
It keeps this up til I do a hard reset (or power down.. very rare).

The only thing I can determine is a common factor of time.. It I don't
reboot my computer for a day or so, it will do the "beeping game".
Otherwise, it "usually" works fine.  Is there any way I can look into
this problem to GIVE a better possible bug report?

PS.  I remember the problem from poeigl too, but it didn't show up

Date: Tue, 1 Mar 1994 13:35:50 GMT

Apologies in advance if this is an RTFM question...

I would like to find the exact location of the bugs which are causing my
pl15{bdefh} system to crash.  I want to find out why the serial driver
isn't talking to all 8 ports on the Gtek BBS550 board recently
installed.  The system ran for 13 months with only one crash (pl10a)
until I upgraded from pl13 to pl15 on the 8th of February.  Since
then, it's been improving with each new kernel downloaded from
ftp.funet.fi (kudos to the developers for all their great work in the
month of February), but it still doesn't have the same old reliability
for which I first came to respect Linux.

How do I (a) get a crash dump, (b) poke at the serial-board hardware; and
(b) otherwise get information about the kernel's status when things go haywire?

When pl15h crashed yesterday, it could respond to 'pings' over the Internet,
but all processes were hung.

Thanks,
-rich

Even though this is gettying :-) silly, I'll add my two cents...

I had this problem in a big way and found the problem to involve
using getty on a modem line. Now I'm not sure about exactly what is
going on but...I have three serial ports 2-16450 1-16550A. The modem
is on the 16550A and I have a serial mouse and a 286 running telix
(it has a 16450 so the line runs at 4800) on the other 16450.  The
last time I opened my machine, I put the modem on the terminal and
the terminal on the modem designated ports by accident.  The next
thing you know, tty65 errors all over the place.

To fix it, I switched the cables and presto, no errors.  I think the
problem is in gettydefs and the way the port is initialized. Since
my modem will auto baud the DTE speed (4800 in this case) I don't
think it was overloading the UART. What I suspect (and I'm probably
wrong) is that by using the wrong gettydefs setting the ports went
nuts. I noticed that the modem RXD lights were flashing continuously
(maybe due the the CLOCAL setting) and the terminal didn't work
(fully expected). The errors occured directly parallel with the RXD
burst on the modem.

This problem has been nagging in this group for sometime and I have
yet to see an answer. This would be nice and might lay in the
gettydefs file. If you have this problem, you might want to check
there.

BTW: The modem usually is served by uugetty but, due to the port
switch, was being managed by getty.

You are missing the fact Linux is _NOT_ NetBSD basically. If you get the
bsd/netinet files from sunacm.swan.ac.uk and install those then compile
with -Ibsd you should be ok (these are the compatibility includes).
Alternatively have a look at Florian de la Roche's excellent ports of
most of the NetBSD tools to see how its done 'properly' as it were.

It would be OK I guess, not ideal and I don't like it - I certainly wouldn't
buy the card. Given that some of the other manufacturers pretty much said
'Of course we give you documentation, its standard' [That's a quote from
a man from Accent who do a nice smart 8 port card]. I ceased to have the need
for more than 6 ports so I got an accent 4 port card to go with my 2 other
ports but they if anything sounded keen on the idea.

Subject: [Q] how do I track down a recurring crash?
Date: 1 Mar 1994 16:59:59 GMT

here's the situation:
Any time I run a program under X that has a high redraw rate, i.e.
xtank, netrek, xboing, etc, and a sound is played, I get a freeze-up.
I've tried having sounds go to both dsp and audio, and running multiple
programs and every time, the machine will freeze shortly into the
high video activity period, usually in the middle of a screen draw.

my setup:
486dx2/66 VLB
.99.15h w/ IN2000 & E2100 drivers added
STB Powergraph S3-805 VLB video
IN2000 scsi card
Cabletron E2100 ether card.
Soundblaster 2.0
extra serial ports

libc 4.5.19, Xfree 2.0-S3 version, sound driver 2.4 from stock pl15h

my thought is that the VLB card is snagging the cpu's attention, and 
for some reason this jams the sound card.  I'd love any tips that tell
me what I can do to try to track this down, or anyone who's running
a similar setup that has has success/failure with it.  One other thought
is that all these programs were (except the kernel) compiled with
older libs, and that might cause some weird problem.

thanks.

I don't think I'm missing anything. These are kinda important structures,
don't ya' think? How else do you tell your program what the structure of
an ip or icmp packet is--just let it guess? Additionally, take a look at
Solaris, which definitely is _NOT_ NetBSD, yet includes these structure
definitions (not in /usr/ucbinclude, either). I know linux is a far cry from
BSD, but I just don't consider IP and ICMP to be BSD-isms only.

So, if Linux doesn't define ip/icmp packets in header, how does one go
about such programming? Might it have something to do with the C library?
