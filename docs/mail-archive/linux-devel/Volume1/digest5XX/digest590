Then you will need 16MB of RAM. (You will need this if you are running

Linux will run fine in 4MB, to run X you really need 8MB (yes there
are a few minimalists who do it in 4MB), to do X development you
should consider 16MB as a minimum.

LILO (the linux loader) will boot almost anything from anywhere 
and allow you to choose at a prompt what you want to boot. It
is configurabale to do almost anything. IDE disks are no problem.
SCSI is normally no problem either but make sure your card is 
supported.

You can put Linux and DOS/Windows on the same disk. No problem.

You should consider where you are going to get the necessary X libraries
etc. If you need the source code to them you might consider investing
in a CDROM drive otherwise you better get yet more disk space.

Get a decent source code control system and learn how to use it before
starting. I find CVS good for stuff spread over multiple directories

Depends really on what software you need to run, and for what

And yes, they do cost more than a low end PeeCee.

Wouldn't this be a bit confusing to some users?  IMHO, most people are used
to _both_ even and odd numbered versions of software (operating systems
included) being considered ``stable'' releases, while some alternative
method (such as the string ``ALPHA'' or ``BETA'', or simply an ``a'' or
``b'' following the main version number (``1.1'' for example)) is used to
indicate ``development'' or ``unstable'' releases.

In addition, due to the possible confusion which could occur from the
``even == stable, odd == development'' method, I'd imagine that even _more_
bandwidth in the comp.os.linux.* newsgroups would be needlessly wasted with
messages asking such questions as (from a new user), ``Why is Linux broken
[using v1.3]?'' or ``What's the difference between Linux v1.1 and v1.2?''

In other words, what _I'm_ suggesting is a version numbering method like
this:

        1.0     Stable (hope)
        1.0.x   minor bugfixes

        1.1 ALPHA
or      1.1 BETA        development
        1.1.x ALPHA
or      1.1.x BETA      bugfixes, new features, more development

After 1.1.x ALPHA (or BETA) seems to be stable, we rename the last version as:

        1.1     Stable
        1.1.x   minor bugfixes

Then, work begins on the next development:

        1.2 ALPHA
or      1.2 BETA        development
        1.2 ALPHA
or      1.2.x BETA      bugfixes, new features, more development

Which, when ``stable'', is renamed to:

        1.2     Stable
        1.2.x   minor bugfixes

One possibility is to use mirror, the package that some archive sites
use to keep up their mirrors. I can be set up to get an entire
director and subdirectories. This is what the config file would look
like for slackware:

package=slackware
        comment=The Linux Slackware Distribution
        site=ftp.cdrom.com
        remote_dir=pub/linux/slackware
        local_dir=/foo/bar/slackware
        mail_to=foofoo

The mirror package is available at:

        src.doc.ic.ac.uk [146.169.2.1]
                directory: computing/archiving/mirror
                (shortcut packages/mirror)

Although it was originally intended to be used for continuous upkeep
of a collectin it works great for getting files just once. One thing
you have to watch out for (especially if you are doing the ftpping
from a linux box): check the logs when the program has finished for
the files that it timed out on. You will have to go back and get
those; either by hand or just run mirror again (it only gets files it
doesn't already have).

Oh my, wouldn't that be too bad.  Really now, we're talking about unix
systems administration and kernel level stuff (yes, compiling and
installing a new kernel is kernel level in my book -- most computer
users don't do this ever).  I think if you want to get involved at this
level of the system, you can expect to learn at least a small amount of
technical detail.  Maybe even/odd versioning isn't used in the software
you encounter, but I've certainly seen it often enough.

Date: 29 Mar 1994 06:32:19 GMT


Hello good people,

I noticed that my OPTI 495SLC mother board + TI486DLC40 does not
enable 486DLC's internal cache when running Linux.  In AMI bios settings I
have both external (128K) cache and internal cache set enabled.

I tried enabling/disabling the internal cache, and sure enough, under
does all the benchmarks showed the expected results.

How do I know it is not enabled under Linux?  Well, I get 7.98
Bogomips on linux. I tried CxPatch, and the Bogomips jumped to 13.21.
Unfortunately the system then died to a message along the lines:

Aha1542.c got the interrupt but no mail.

Sorry, can't remember the exact wording. However, seems that DMA has
not updated the cache.

Has anybody successfully licked this problem? 

Software versions:
CxPatch v0.25, linux 0.99.13p, libc4.4.4, gcc 2.4.5.

Hardware:
OPTI 495SLC MB with TI495DLC, IIT4C87DLC, 128K Cache
AMI Bios v2.1



Please email the replys; I'll summarize on request.



Thanks,

Harri

Shouldn't even be all that difficult.  At least some Unix ftp clients
(e.g. Sun) can direct the receive stream to standard output - so you
should be able to pipe this into tar.

Or, alternatively, write a C program to use pipe() to create a named
pipe "file", persuade your FTP client to "append" to this pipe, and
start up a tar process which reads its input from the pipe.

Subject: cluster-patches lead to error on fsync
Date: Tue, 29 Mar 1994 21:11:40 GMT

When I use the cluster patches with Linux 1.0, some fsync() calls return
EIO (unix error 5, "I/O error").  This behavior is the same since several
releases of Linux and the cluster pathches.  The same binaries run well,
as long as I don't use these patches.

Did anybody encounter this problem?  And does this one know of any workaround?

Background:  I ported a DBMS system to Linux.  It ensures that the write
operations went onto the disk via fsync() calls.  (As far as I know, O_SYNC
isn't implemented yet, right?)  This leads to quite a lot of fsync() calls.
I cannot reproduce the phenomen with a simple test program which does just
a few write()'s and fsync()'s.  It would take me a lot of time to get a
debug version of the software;  that's why I'm asking "the net".

I'm not sure what it is exactly that you want.  There is indeed no
profil() system call in the Linux kernel, but there is a routine in
the C library under that name which does the same thing.

As to profiling tools: gprof is in the binutils package and recently I
wrote a "profiling per source code line" utility called bprof which
can be found in

sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/devel/bprof-0.1.tar.gz

MY SOLUTION:
I experienced the same behaviour last summer ( even OS/2 2.0 TRAPed every
10 minutes). I installed a ventilator and NEVER saw this again.
I traced this down to the room temperature, the higher the temperature the
less time would OS/2 run. In Linux it happened nearly only when I compiled a
new Kernel (there you could continue, OS/2 had to be rebooted).

   **** I did this.  Unfortunately, I didn't have space on my Sun workstation to hold both
the tarred file and the directories.  So I wound up getting the stuff all over again,
directory by directory. 

    I dreamt of a script that would activate FTP, tell it to get slackware.tar, and pipe its
output straight up to tar on my machine, which would then spew out files and directories.
Probably an impossible dream......

Hi,

 yesterday at home I've got following error (on my new box)

scsi0: reseting for second half of retries
SCSI disk error: host 0 id 0 lun 0, return code 27070000
scsidisk I/O error: dev 0806, sector ???

This happened after a X-Crash, while checking the filesystem,
and the solution was to let the system cool down for 10 minutes,
afterwards it worked again.

My problem is that the X-Crash seems to repeat itself more often, but
thats another story. So what does this message mean?

My software:
Slackware 1.1.2 -> Linux kernel pl15f with PLIP compiled in and 
                   without normal harddisk support, without SCSI support
                   except Adaptec 1542 support.
My Hardware:
SOYO (not sure about the name) VESA LB motherboard.
32MB RAM
2ser+1par I/O card.
SCSI controller: Buslogic 445 (is recognised as Adaptec 1542)
                 I/O adr: 330, IRQ 10/11 (not sure now, it's the default)
HD: QUANTUM ProDrive 1800 S

The kernel detects
QUANTUM PD1800S Revision 3162
Type: Direct-access Ansi-Rev. 2

Another thing: Sometime after a cold reboot the kernel just halt without any
messages at this time. This is not that big a trouble, because it happens really
seldom.

Thanx in advance for any suggestions,

Andreas

P.S.: I'll upgrade today to Linux 1.0 and see if the problem goes away.
