The problem is that a good log-structured file system will not allocate
block numbers to file data as the application writes them into the cache,
but as the cache is written to disk.
One of the Sprite papers says that this is a major performance win.

The current Linux VFS can't do that. Not easily, anyway.

Select() on read/write returns true iff for nonblocking I/O (when
available), a read/write call will either return an error or transfer
some data.

Select() on exception is extremely poorly defined.

You're probably right. Note that /dev/null, on select for reading, doesn't
return true -- IMHO a Good Thing.

Why? The corresponding write() call won't block...on the subsequent
write(), you get an error, and if you're not smart enough to remove the
bit from your select mask in the next call, you've got a bug in your program.

CSLIP uses a special algorithm for handling the IP and TCP headers.
It has no effect on the data at all.  Your theory can't be right.  It
would be very odd for a TCP problem to depend upon the data.  The
only data-dependent problems I've ever seen with TCP (on any
system) have turned out to be due to problems with the checksum
algorithm or data-dependent problems with a modem.  I doubt that
Linux' checksum code is bad.

I have noticed that SLIP does work with 1.0 but has problems running
ftp and the like with anything beyond that. I tried 1.0p2 and 1.0p4 but

But is it necessary to change anything in kernel or /proc?
It sounds as if what you want could be obtained by just slightly
modifying the programs script and less.

Yes, I have thought about that, too. Sometimes one would like a somewhat
different foreground/background mechanism, where not the unique foreground
process (or process group) gets all of the keyboard, but some keys are for
one program and some for another.
But again this should not be obtained by modifying the kernel, but by
inserting a user process that captures all keystrokes and decides to whom
of its children these should go.

Subject: How to use VARARGS under Linux ?
Date: Fri, 25 Mar 1994 03:10:12 GMT

I would like to use the VARARGS principle (to pass to a function varying list
of arguments). I have noticed that there exists vsprintf(), exists also
_G_config.h with some related declarations.

Still, I cannot compile my sample VARARGS program, because a lot of
declarations are missing:

# include <stdio.h>
# include <varargs.h>

main()
{
        my_log( "format with %d args: int and %s\n", 2, "string" ) ;
}

/*VARARGS1 PRINTFLIKE1*/
my_log( va_alist )
va_dcl
{
    va_list     argp ;
    char        *fmt ;
    char        string[ 5000 ] ;

    va_start( argp ) ;
    fmt = va_arg( argp, char *) ;
    vsprintf( string, fmt, argp ) ;
    va_end( argp ) ;
    puts( string ) ;
}


May be under Linux VARARGS are appied differently ?
Does anybody use VARARGS related programming ?
Any examples appreciated ...

I am using the IIT....  I may need to change to the Cyrix..  I have been able
to get the cache limping along, but can't run programs that use certain types
of calls to the math co, little ones, like, oh, XV!... darn.  well I need to

thinking about getting a "true" 486DX VLB motherboard as an upgrade path.
 
Both good and bad to hear that I'm not the only one having this problem...

If you pull the distribution from sunsite.unc.edu or tsx-11.mit.edu you can
do a get of <distribution>.tar.gz which pulls a tar gzipped directory

It's not exactly what you asked for, but if you look on Slackware's
home site you'll find   ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/linux/zooed_slackware   in 
which each of the "disks" has been bundled into a single zoo file.
Zoo itself is widely available (in versions for both DOS and Unix ...)

Hi,

I tried to connect a DosBox via PLIP to a LinuxMachine (1.0.4).
Using plip.com from the Crynwr collection (pktd11.zip), the result of 
a ping from the DosBox to Linux is : 
        
        plip1: wrong header octet
        checksum error

When I looked into plip.c, I found some comments, saying " The protocol

Can I hope for compatible PLIP soon?

xmix works according to what the kernel sound driver says is available
on your card.  I use 1 NFS mounted copy of xmix and xvmixer, and run on
one machine with a PAS-16, it gives bass, treble, and all the other 
neat stuff, while on the SBPro, the bass and treble controls just don't
function.  Personally, I like xvmixer's look better, but the two are 
pretty much equivalent.

I'd like to see that too.   Although I have managed to abstract out a
goodly chunk of the architecture/machine dependencies, there is still
quite a lot left to do.  This abstraction changes directory structure
of the kernel somewhat also.

This isn't an impossible task, but I'm likely not to work on it
until:

 1) I've got the Linux/68k kernel up to a "1.0" equivalency.
 2) The Linux/68k kernel is "out of alpha".

This gets you 'slackware.tar' which you may gzip yourself... which doesn't 
gain you much since the contents are mostly already gzipped piecemeal.

Obviously, this only works if your link is squeeky clean and holds up long
enough to snarf the entire shebang...  (_NOT_ advisable for 14.4K dialup 
SLIP or 'term' links...)

Subject: Re: Kernel don't recognizes HP PC LAN Ethernet Card !

Hello Thomas,


    The problem is that the HP LAN driver (hp.c) is broken  in Linux
0.99pl15 an even 1.0. I corrected the bug last week and sent it to 
Donald Becker who have promised me to put it into Linux 1.10.

    Meanwhile here is the very simple correction to make at the beginning
of the hp_probe routine:

     the test test 

              else if (ioaddr > 0)
                  return ENXIO;

     should actually be

              else if (ioaddr < 0)
                  return ENXIO;

If you don't want to recompile your kernel (which is fairly easy) I can
send you a bootable Image of my patched kernel.

Hope this helps.
Laurent
