It's hard to comment on this as you don't include any source, but select
seems to work as it 'should' on linux.

This little program will print 'test' about every other second, it will
also print the new values of the timeval struct you pass to select:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
main () {
    struct timeval t;
    while (1) {
        t.tv_sec = 2;
        t.tv_usec = 0;
        select (0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &t);
        printf ("test tv_sec:%d, tv_usec:%d\n", t.tv_sec, t.tv_usec);
    }
}

On a Linux system this program will typically produce this output:
test tv_sec:0, tv_usec:0
test tv_sec:0, tv_usec:0
etc...

While on SunOs you'll get
test tv_sec:2, tv_usec:0
test tv_sec:2, tv_usec:0
etc...

Therefore, to make portable code, you should set <t> each time you call
select, since select may or may not modify the passed timeval
struct depending on what system you are on.

Hello everybody,

Is is possible to install Slackware from tape?
I have a 150Mb SCSI tape drive connected to a Adapect 1542C. Running
Slackware 1.1.2 I can read and write the tape (even read a tape written
on a Sun running SunOs 4.1.3).
Do I need a special boot floppy, or what?

Thanks in advance,

---Hans.

But _before_ comment out the following lines around line#450:

        while (size!=0) {
                        while (malloc(size)!=(char *)NULL)
                                total+=(size/2);
                        size/=2;
                }

that drive my Linux box to a quiet dead :-) after a lot of swapping. 
BTW: is this normal? I cannot afford test it on another Unix. My conf
is Linux pre-1.0, 8M ram, 16M swap. The box don't crash nor panic,
only get more and more slow if I don't ctrl-c the program.

Wrong.
The Amiga hardware is capable of reading/writing GCR as well as MFM, 
but at a single defined bit rate. I never heard about a program using GCR,
although it might be used in copy protection.

The standard format for Amiga floppies is MFM with 11 sectors/track. The
problem for PC hardware, as I see it, is the fact that there are no gaps
between the sectors except after the last written. Still, I would assume
that reading an Amiga disk should be possible.

I would guess from reading what is written on my disk package that PC disks
have 9 _software_ sectors - it says "soft sectored" - so I don't see the 
difference here.

Actually, they replaced this with variable bit density zones. (It's
compatible.)

I don't think so. (Not with variable bit densities.) I vaguely recall that
somebody tried to fake variable speed by quickly turning the motor on and
off, and succeeded ... in frying at least one vital part of their disk
hardware.  :-/

SIWM ("Super Integrated Woz Machine"). The IWM was the first integrated

(of course) by Steve Wozniak... totally incomprehensible, but it did its
job with the absolutely fewest possible number of parts. ;-)

My code hashes on addresses.  Because the addrlen returned from recvfrom
includes the pad at the end of inet addrs, my hash function hashes on it.
The code in inet/udp.c doesn't zero the pad, so I get stack garbage.

udp.c, line 484:

  /* Copy the address. */
  if (sin) {
   struct sockaddr_in addr;

   addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   addr.sin_port = skb->h.uh->source;

   memcpy_tofs(sin, &addr, sizeof(*sin));

  Hi folks,

  I'am trying to write a linux console driver for the Atari machine.
I'm based upon the Amiga kernel sources. But I was wondering
something.

  For printing on the screen, I have to allocate a screen buffer that
should be coutiguous (I should'nt be split into the memory nor should
it be swapped ) . Is the kmalloc doing such thing or how to do it ?
( the Amiga kernel is a port of the pl14 kernel).
Second the real adresses seems to be different from the virtual
adresses. How to compute them ?

  Thanks a lot for showing me the way...

Someone has done rarp in the kernel for pl12, I think.
I have mailed him a copy of the BSD rarpd, and he tries to port it to linux.
Maybe he is soon ready with a first version...

Subject: pre-1 kernel crash
Date: 9 Mar 94 13:39:22 GMT


        Greetings. I just had a weird but reproducible kernel
        krash. I reproduce it by running /usr/lib/makewhatis of all
        things. Nothing else does it!

        The first time it happened (a day ago), I just got a 
        "Segment fault" after makewhatis executed for 20-40 seconds.
        After the first message, re-running the command would
        immedietly produce the error. I would have to reboot to get
        the 20-40 second "run time" before the error error. I though,
        "I'm going to upgrade to Slack 1.1.2, screw makewhatis" :-)

        Today, I made the mistake of trying it again this morning:

        I got 2+ pages of "Unable to handle kernel paging request at
        address 24440336".... So, I did the next logical thing....
        I switched to the next VC (I have 14), hit ENTER, my prompt
        scrolled up again, I though, "Oh, goody", enter "root" and it
        just hung. So I switch to a VC in which I was logged in:

        It gets weird here... naturally, the internal shell commands work
        but any command fails with the "unable to handle kernel paging"
        and a "Segment fault" to boot at the end of the stack dump. Yes,
        I did copy a few complete entries.

        I then switched to the VC that got the 2+ pages of dumps and 
        noticed a pattern: all the running jobs (normally 20 or so)
        got dumped. I was a bit shocked to see "init" spill its guts :-)

        While I was looking over the above and twiddling my thumbs in
        anticipation of the [of course] unbacked up FS(es), after ~20
        seconds, crond spilled its guts with a stack dump.... 

        Now, it gets even weirder, when I rebooted (had to hit reset!),
        I checked the /usr/adm/ system logs (all of them) NOTHING. 
        Actually, after trying it a few times, I got this from syslog:

=================chop=with=axe================chop=with=axe=====================

        There's more. I changed "update" to "update 10" just to feel
        safer :-), I prepare the VC's for easy switching, got top
        running in 2 VCs, etc. and re-ran /usr/lib/makewhatis. Sure
        enough, 2 minutes later the VC I was watching filled up with
        "unable to handle".... but, I was kinda hoping this time...

        What changed was that when I switched to a non-logged in VC and
        pressed ENTER, I would get:
