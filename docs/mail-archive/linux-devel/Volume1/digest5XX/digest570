I am having problems with running ncurses-based application from a serial
terminal. Using the very same environement (both TERM=vt100) it works from the
console but not the terminal; There is simply generates floating point fault.

I traced the problem into a call to mvcur(0,0,0,0) which seems to cause the
problem, as when I run it from the console the call is mvcur(0,0,1,0).


Thanks in advance, Yossi.

The PLIP (parallel port IP) driver occasionally goes into the 100uS delay times.
Its not a good idea in general use. You'll drop serial characters and will get
possible network card overruns also.

Unmasked.

Only a non maskable interrupt, and those are normally memory failures (ie parity)

This is one approach. Linux uses at least one time for the usec clock accuracy.
If you are worried about the 100uS +/- not very many you obviously interrupt at
say 70uS and then busy wait the last few. Bear in mind that an IDE disk I/O
especially with the multi-block patches can knock you over a 100uS out easily.

This sounds quite feasible. I assume you are not intending to have 16 people
playing games and writing essays on the machine at the same time. If not then
it'll feel slightly icky but no worse.

Subject: Ext2fs secure rm bug (?) plus ideas for improvement
Date: Mon, 21 Mar 94 01:15:39 GMT

        I was looking at the ext2fs code and found something weird.
The secure rm attribute on ext2fs files is only referenced in
fs/ext2/truncate.c and not in fs/ext2/namei.c (which contains unlink).
The ext2_unlink does not seem to call any trucation functions (as far
as I can tell). Thus it seems that truncates will securely delete
blocks (by covering them up with random junk), but an unlink will
NOT. Once the last link to a file with secure rm enabled is deleted,
the secure rm algorithm should be used. Or does ext2fs do this, and
I'm not seeing it? Should I add a call to ext2_truncate right before
unlink unlinks the last reference?
        Also, I am thinking of an enhancement for secure rm. Overwrite
with all ones, then all zeros, then random junk, then default info
(i.e. what would be there if that part of the fs was never used).
This would make it hard for data to be recovered by those that have
the hardware to read data that was been written over once. Allowing
multiple passes would be nice too. Like the wipedisk program of Norton
Utilities (TM) does (although it does not ever write random data, if I
remember correctly :| )

This (and the deleted other stuff) leads me to the idea to alter the
screen blanking code in a way, that supports not only any laptops' screen
blanking function but also the power saving function of the new monitor
generation according to TCO91 and TCO92.

Personally I have a Smile 1506, and this monitor has the power save
feature labelled "Energy Star - EPA Pollution Preventer".

For DOS operation Smile has the small programm EM.COM which I lately
disassembled but did not have the time to fully comment. It does some
port-I/O (polarity switching of HSYNC/VSYNC) to signal the blanking
request to the monitor, which then activates its local power save feature
(Standby Mode).
The monitors' power consumption is shut down to somewhere around 3 Watts!

About RARPD and BPF:

- That packet filter is already included in an old ported version of tcpdump.
  Fetch a new one from 134.96.7.7:/pub/Linux/source/networking/NetBSD/tcpdump*
  I had a quick look at it, but didn't fix many things. The calling semantics
  for newer versions have changed, so the Linux support in "tcpdump" has to be
  changed. (probably only a little bit.)
  (And most probably don't look at my changes, but start from scratch...)

- As Alan has already said, take the NetBSD rarpd and write a Makefile. All
  further changes should be minimal.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question! Here is the basic summary
of my problem and it's solution.

Problem: 1) Direct screen writes to the text screen don't always work after
         mmap'ing the video memory into userspace. 2) Free'ing mmap'd area
         causes a seg-fault.

Solution: 1) Linux's scrolling code modify the starting address of the video
          memory so that it can do smooth scrolling. Therefore, the
          starting address is not always 0xB8000. The code below shows how
          to get the offset which should be added to 0xB8000. 2) use munmap()
          to unmap memory or just let linux do the job when your program exits.

Which leads me to one final question: Can someone explain why the '<< 1' is
needed in the code fragment below? My guess is in the comments below which
I figured/guessed/voodoo by reading around in console.c. 

Again, Thanks to all who answered,
mahesh

I've just finished putting my Linux box on the internet, and I've noticed
a couple of problems/shortcomings with the networking code.  I was
wondering if someone could let me know if there are workarounds or
if people are working on addressing them in future releases.

tcp.c: tcp_data memory leak detected.
This one seems pretty obvious.  I reproduce this one pretty easily,
when getting news.

The second problem is related to the first.  I don't seem to be able to
get larger (>30K) files news articles across the wire.  I've telneted
by hand to the nntp port and tried grabbing the article, and the tail
end of it gets lost (along with the termination character).  This
problem only occurs on linux systems, so I'm guessing theres some
sort of buffering problem on telnet connections when lots of
data gets sent?
