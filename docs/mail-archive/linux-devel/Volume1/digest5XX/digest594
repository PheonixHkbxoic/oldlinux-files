I have just purchased the new Orchid Kelvin 64-bit graphics card. It is
not supported in the current version of XFree86 as far as I know so I
don't know how to run X at this point. It uses a new Cirrus Logic chipset, I
think it is a 5434. Does anyone else have this card up and running
with the correct configurations and/or how may I go about getting this
card to work?

Also, someone mentioned that I may be able to set it up as a Cirrus
Logic 5426 (although not taking advantage of its much greater speed
capabilities). What would I need to change to try this out? I used to
have a Trident 8900C w/1 meg (now you know why I upgraded...SLOOOOOW)

On another note...what is a good way to test the "speed" of this card
to compare it to others...it seems fairly fast in Windoze (yuch)


Be Kind...I am a newbie trying to learn
Thanks in advance!

Just out of curiosity, why are you suspicious of any drive that
supports fewer than 32 sectors?  I would think that 16 or even 8
sectors would go a long way in reducing the overhead, and that you
probably aren't saving much by increasing it to 32.  Cutting it down
to 16 (or 8) might also help those serial port overruns.

Hi there,

today I examined the SCSI-Howto and found the following lines:

Subsection C : Adaptec 152x, 151x, Sound Blaster 16 SCSI, 
        AIC 6260 chips (Standard)
Supported Configurations : 
BIOS addresses : 0xd8000, 0xdc000, 0xd0000, 0xd4000, 0xc8000, 0xcc000, 0xe0000,
        0xe4000.
Ports : 0x140, 0x340
IRQs : 9, 10, 11, 12
DMA is not used
IO : port mapped

Does this definitely mean that Linux can support the SB 16 SCSI,
because it is Adaptec 152x-compatible ????

That would be great... any clue would be appreciated!

It's pretty impressive all right, especially when you consider that it ran

Too bad they had such anemic keyboards...it was fun to play with.

I have a Soundblaster-16scsi-2 card, and use external SCSI-2
devices under linux successfully. What I did was turn on the
Adaptec 152x support when I build my kernels. Also, since there
is no boot-ROM on the SB16SCSI2 card, one must tell the kernel
to look for the chip upon boot-up at the "LILO: " prompt:

LILO: linux aha152x=0x140,11,7,1

Arguments:
0x140 = I/O port base address.
11 = IRQ that the chip is set to (jumper)
7 = SCSI ID of the chip itself.
1 = flag for SCSI reconnect feature (I Think... May be optional...)

Unfortunately though, the aha152x driver seems to have a bug in it
that crashes the system completely when I transfer LARGE files to/from
a Syquest 105M removeable HD. I can do normal I/O to a toshiba XM3301B
cdrom drive and the syquest, but the system hangs with a message to
the effect "more data than expected &^%&$&..." and hangs.. :-(

Anybody know of a patch to the aha152x driver? I haven't looked
at the source code yet to see who the author(s) is/are yet...

I've installed the ide performance package upon linux 1.0 and have found
the following:  Whenever I have disk activity, the mouse jumps around under X.
This has made the system unusable whenever there is any real swapping going
on.  Worse yet, I can't manage to control the mouse enough to be able to
kill the offending apps gracefully.  Enevitably, I end up exiting X and killing
the app by hand.  Not good.  btw I'm running linux 1.0 on a 386-33 with 8M
ram and a 100M Conner ide drive.  I hope that this can be fixed before 
inclusion into the standard kernel - it really makes machine quite unusable.

Subject: Speed problem with more then one ext2-partition
Date: 31 Mar 1994 17:55:09 +0200

I have a speed problem using more then one ext2 partition on one harddisk.
I have recognized that if I using two and more (ext2) partitions the raw
harddiskspeed drop from >1M per sec (15.15 sec for 16Mbytes) down to
0.8M per sec (20.00 sec for 16Mbytes) with two ext2 partitions and
0.64M per sec (25.00 sec for 16Mbytes) with three ext2 partitions mounted.

I used following speed test:
        dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/null bs=8k count=2k

I am using linux under following hardware condition:

486DX33 8Mbyte RAM,ISA, AHA1542CF SCSI:600M, IDE:420M(Western digital), 160M
(Conner)

The SCSI-Drive contains one ext2-partition. The 160M(Conner) contains one dos
-partition and the 420M(Western digital) contains 1 dos, 1 swap, and 1-3 ext2-
partitions.

The speed data above are for the IDE:420M(Western digital). I have not tested
if the SCSI-Drive behave like the IDE-Drive.


My question is: Where does the kernel lose the speed performance.

Firstly, try defining VERBOSE_DRIVEID as 1 at the top of hd.c - you will
get lots of info. The key is the MaxMultSect field in this extra info. As
the kernel patch stands, it only enables the multi mode stuff if this is
>= 32, as there were problems with some drives with MaxMultSect = 16.`


>I would have thought the Western Digital drive would have this feature, as
>it is practically brand new.  Oh well, it matches the rest of my system. :)

This time, you are (sort of) in luck. The WDC AC2540H, which is the 540Mb
version of the same drive, supports 16 sector multimode, so I would be
extremly surprised if the 340Mb version doesn't. The trick is as follows:
change line 324 of hd.c from
                        if ((i = ib[47] & 0xff) >= 32)
to
                        if ((i = ib[47] & 0xff) >= 16)
and it should work.
However, I have (I think) the same seagate drive, and it doesn't support
multimode at all.
Before installing the patches I was getting a raw transfer rate off the WD
of around 730 kb/s, now I get about 1200k/s, and reading from the drive
consumes a bit less cpu. Your mileage may vary.

>My question is this: Since multimode is not available, can I expect to see
>any performance increase by installing this patch?

Possibly a little - interrupts are enabled for more of the time. Should
allow your machine to get a little more other work done while something is
waiting for the drive.

FYI, my other drive is a "Conner Peripherals 170MB - CP30174E", which also
has 16 sector multimode capability - with that drive I get no speedup, in
terms of elapsed time to read data, but it consumes a lot less cpu (like
22% instead of 60%). Again, your mileage may vary.

It has been done the other way around.

I once attended an Inmos conference where they told about a successfull
experiment of writing a X-server completely in Occam. They defined the
X-protocol as a protocol for a channel and implemented the functionality
from scratch. This resulted in a fast X-terminal.

One word about Occam 2 - I _love_ it! I wrote software for a NMR-scanner
in Occam 2 about 4 years ago. Now I am struggling with Solaris and C++.
And I really miss the simplicity and power behind the most ingenious language
in the world. It would be a great thing to build a kernel that could use
the lightning-fast task switching and channel interrupts that the transputer is good at. Shared memory can also be addressed by accessing memory through
channels.

Best of luck!

First you say it is not broken, then you ask how hard it would be to _fix_.
A slight contradiction there.
It should be easy to get the buffers up to almost 4k, trivial in fact.
After that you'd need to hack kmalloc, use vmalloc, or have the net code 
use 2 buffers per large packet or somesuch.

P.S. Is calling vmalloc from an interrupt bad?
