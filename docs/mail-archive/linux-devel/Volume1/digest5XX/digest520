 Hello netters,

        Given a open file descriptor or file  pointer how one can obtain the indoe

Hello,
I want to run coff-binaries (from sco-unix) on my linux-system but the only answer
from linux is segmention fault. I have seen (on tsx-11.mit.edu in the file ls-lR)
that there are some ibcs2 and coff library which I could not get from any linux-ftp-
server. 
Where can I get this libraries and tools ?

If you are building emacs-19.22 with a recent version of the c library

1. The internals of FILE have changed.
2. I also removed -D_BSD_SOURCE.  I don't see any difference.  If

The _ is not a special operator or prefix, it is just part of the
symbol.  So ___main and _main are just two different symbols.

It is customary to put a single _ in front of the name of a C function,
so that no clashes can occur with symbols generated by the compiler
itself.  Multiple underscores are used in the C library to prevent
clashes between library functions and user functions, but of course
this can be only partly successful as the user can write function
names like that as well...

Subject: TCP: What is LAST_ACK?
Date: Fri, 4 Mar 1994 16:42:02 GMT

I'm having a lot of trouble with TCP connections that stall in a LAST_ACK
state.  This happens mostly from gopher connections, but sometimes from ftp,
too.  This will hang up the gopher/ftp client until the server or 
the client times out. If the client times out first then some data is lost,
but if the client hangs on until Linux times out then the file is 
received intact.

So, what does LAST_ACK mean?  Why would the Linux side stall in this state?
And, what can I do about it?

Here's my setup:
Slackware 1.1.2 - pl15<something> 
(But, I think this happend under 1.1.1 - pl14, too)
3c509 card using TP port.
16 Mb RAM.

Have a look at fs/open.c - given an 'int fd', you do:

struct file *file;
struct inode *inode;

if (fd < NR_OPEN && (file=current->filp[fd]) && (inode=file->f_inode)) {
  /* do something */
}

If you were interested in how to do this in a user level program with
an ordinary open file, check the manpage for fstat(2), and look up
what this newsgroup is for.

It is very easy to write it your own spooler.  Just connect to TCP

Hi!

I would like to change the kernel screen saver in a way that it puts my
nice new digitally controlled monitor into suspension, which should shut
it off after a certain time. So far the screen blanker just blanks the
screen. Does someone know how one could change this so that the monitor
gets a SUSPEND signal (or optionally, OFF and ON) ? I don't have any
documentation on how to do this, but would be willing to make patches to
the kernel.

Thanks for any help,

There are manual pages on ioperm() and iopl().

I've written a few ethercard setup/diagnostic programs.  They use (depending
on the card's interface) ioperm(), iopl() and mmap() in the shared memory.

And you *must* compile with optimization on for the inline functions to be

There are a significant number of motherboards that have this limitation.
To do otherwise requires using more tag bits (another SRAM) or cheating on
the address bits (feign shock that someone would do this).

Was this written by the marketing arm of the people that designed a
cacheless motherboard?

I've had two occasion to run non-trivial tests with the external cache turned
off.  They were both using new machines that turned out to have bad cache
chips.  It took 6-7 minutes for a i486DX33 to compile 0.97 (yes!) with a
256K secondary cache.  The identical test took about 15 minutes with the
secondary cache disabled.  The same experiment with a i486DX2-66 and a later
kernel yielded similar results.
