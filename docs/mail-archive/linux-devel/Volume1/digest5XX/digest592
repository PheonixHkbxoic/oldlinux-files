Greetings.  I have a newly installed SlackWare 1.2.0 Linux 1.0
system installed here and have been expereincing problems with 
telnet and ftp.  Machine is configured wtih NE2000 ether card.

From Linux: 
telnet to a host within my domain initiates the connection
and reports the escape character back (^]) but then it hangs
and the login proompt is not displayed.

ftp says connected, but doesn't go any further.

ping works fine on hosts within the domain, but outisde our domain (through our router) see fail rate >90%.  Ping from toher machien to outside the domain succeeds fine

INstallation was done via NFS, so I'm guessing that that was working well (I havne't tried it recently).

From other machine:
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out
ftp times out as well.

ping doesn't show Linux as alive

Replies prefered via e-mail as I can't get here to check the group often enough and might miss a posted reply.

Thanks

Subject: Bug in atof
Date: Wed, 30 Mar 1994 17:07:58 GMT


I found a bug in the subroutine atof()

the offending code is the following

  double mortrate_pc;

  while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "i:f:b:p:m:c:s:t:x:")) != -1)
    switch (c) {

    ...

    case 'm':
      mortrate_pc = atof(optarg);
      break;

    ...

When the program is called with the option -m 6 or any integer
mortrate_pc gets the correct value of 6.

When the program is called with the option -m 7.5 the variable 
mortrate_pc gets the correct value of 1.


The program was compiled using gcc under linux. Yggdrasil distribution
from 3 months ago.

I've seen this bug previously in the early versions of SUN'OS for
sparc stations.

Can somebody point me to where atof is in the gcc compiler so that I
can fix it or if someone has already solved point to the location of
the patch.

Thanks for your help.

Sergio

P.S  A workaround this code is using 

sscanf(optarg," %lf%",&mortrate_pc); but sounds like an overkill.

The driver must have at least 32 sector multiple mode, but WD2340 has
only 16 sect. multiple mode so it is not enabled. You can tweak hd.c to
allow multiple mode on smaller sector counts. I have done this with my
WD2340 and had no problems.

Hi.  The patches are deliberately suspicious of any drive which supports
fewer than 32 sectors in multiple mode.  Your drives support only about 16,
so it skips them by default.  To get around that, just look for the comparism
in my patches (look for 32) and change it to 16.  There should be no problem
with either drive.  The problem is that the message it outputs "older drive"
is misleading.. ooops.

Look elsewhere in this group for the latest version (posted today)
that has been submitted to Linus for inclusion in future kernels.
It includes a program to change the settings on the fly, letting you
try out different values and measure the effects on performance.

Cheers,

I believe I've found a bug which prevents the kernel from
automatically rebooting a machine.

If there is a "tail -f" of some files going on when you issue the
reboot command (or CTRL-ALT-DEL), then things hang right after it
prints "done." at the bottom of the screen.  Has anyone else run into
this problem?

AMI (like always) has messed up again...  My DLC test machine is a Phoenix
BIOS DLC-aware board and works fine without the patch.  Needless to say,
my DRx2 machine (with the patch) also works (and it's also a Phoenix BIOS).

Now that I've got your attention, I think I'll do my annual I-HATE-AMI
spiel:

I dislike AMI BIOS so much that I'll willingly pay a premium to get a
machine that uses some other BIOS (my favorite, as you can probably
guess, is Phoenix).  In all my dealings with machines containing AMI
BIOSes, I've had nothing but trouble- yes, after fiddling with all the
settings, you can get it running fine, but put it side-by-side with a
Phoenix or other BIOS, and the AMI machine feels much slower whenever
anything has to be done with the BIOS.  AMI also has several annoying
traits- first, during the memory test, instead of completely aborting
the test when a key is pressed like other "real" BIOSes do, AMI just
starts counting faster, but still slow enough to be annoying.  Then,
there's the "Wait..." message..  What the *#%@)*^% is it waiting for??
Godin?? :-)  Then there's that god-awful color scheme in the setup..
what where the programmers smoking?  So why the hell do so many
machines use AMI in spite of these bugs and annoyances?  Who knows...
My guess is that AMI probably undercut all the other players with low
licensing fees..  (about 5-6 years ago, I called Phoenix about customizing
a BIOS for a machine..  they said it would cost around $25000 to
customize and license a copy..  Anyone know what current costs for various
BIOS suppliers are?)..

Anyways, that's about the end of my anti-AMI rant..  no replies to the
above please..  I just wanted to express my opinions on the shortcomings
of AMI BIOS and the last thing I want to start is a BIOS war..

The source of the problem is that I made a "mistake" in the patch-
a bit that gained another 1% speed on a DRx2 should not have been
used in the DLC setting.  With this bit on, some motherboards will
work (like my Phoenix..  sorry, I seem to have slipped back into my
AMI-sux mode :-) ), but most *won't*.  To be on the safe side, you
shouldn't use the default setting unless you're really sure it will
work.  The fix- change the CCR0 value 0x22 to 0x23.  This should fix
most machines, and your BogoMips value will drop from 13.21 to 13.10,
which is not a big deal (like I said, about 1%)

If you all can wait until the end of the week, I'll be releasing
CxPatch 0.30, which is Linux 1.0 compatible, and among other things,
allows use of the full patch for greater safety (at the expense of
OAK VGA detection, which nobody has anyways..  (if you do have an OAK,
tough..  it's time to get a real VGA card)).  A patch to change the
DRAM refresh rate is also included in CxPatch 0.30 for people whose
motherboards don't have the hidden refresh option or can't use it
for some reason or other.

<lots of stuff about linux deleted>

Ok,  I think you guys are making this entirely too complicated.  When I 
started this thread a few weeks back,I was talking about turning my XT, 
which is serving as a dust holder right now, into a simple file-server or 
hard-drive controller for the 64/128 which I use all the time.  I dont 
have, and dont think it would work if I did have it, Linux.  I was just 
thinking that it would be nifty if you could write an app for the dos 
environment that would take a disk image (.d64?), then you could type 
LOAD "$",8 on the C= and boom, you would get a dir.  Then you could load 
and play the games off the XT's HD like it was a 15X1 drive.  All this 
stuff would be entirely transparent to the C=, I think this is important 
as to aloow for maximum compatibility.

any thoughts??

I'm a owner of a A4000/040/10, and have been waiting for a unix for my machine
(the original IDE-drive has been the problem so far). The first thing I did
after seeing that Linux had adopted the IDE-drives was to test it out.
I used the new kernel and the new filesystem, and had no luck. Many of the
programs on in the ramdiskimage don't work, for example mkfs and mount.
Because of this I haven't been able to test the driver. Could the reason for
this problem be the difficulties with 040 copybackcache and shared libraries?
If so, is there a way around this right now, or will I have to wait for a new
kernel?

Subject: Announcement of Linux/68k Version 0.08
Date: 30 Mar 1994 00:53:32 GMT

This message announces the availability of version 0.08 of Linux/68k.

It can be ftped from directory /pub/linux/680x0 at tsx-11.mit.edu.

A precompiled kernel executable and the Amiga "bootstrap" program can
be found in kern-0.08.tar.gz in the "kernel" subdirectory.

The kernel source can be found in linux-0.08.tar.gz in the "src"
subdirectory.  Patches against 0.07pl4 can be found in
linux-0.08.diffs.gz in the "src" subdirectory.

A new, 1024K ramdisk filesystem image has been put in the "filesys"
subdirectory in the "new-filesys.gz" file.  This ramdisk filesystem is
an "ext2" filesystem containing new shared libraries and a slew of
programs which are necessary to build/rebuild hard disk filesystems.
You can replace the libraries on your hard disk partitions with the
new versions on the ramdisk image.  You can also replace some of your
statically linked executables with executables from the ramdisk image
(see below (#)). 

There is a bug in binutils-1.9l.1 when linking dynamically.  If the
program you are linking overrides a shared library function, then the
program will get a SIGSEGV when it tries to execute that function.
I've put a patch to binutils-1.9l.1 in "ld.diffs.shlib" in the "tools"
subdirectory.  I'll be distributing a new "usr.tar.gz" archive later
which will contain the new "ld", and will get rid of the statically
linked executables found in /usr/bin, replacing them with dynamically
linked executables.

The changes in this release against 0.07pl4 include:

*) A change in the way that the return value from system calls are
   returned to user programs. Unfortunately, this breaks the existing
   4.5.19 shared library and any existing statically linked
   applications.  This change was unavoidable.  The "new-filesys.gz"
   file in the "filesys" directory contains the new shared libraries 
   and dynamically linked executables (#).

*) A number of bug fixes.

*) Changes from Martin Apel which allow use of the copyback cache on
   68040 processors.  Martin says that he thinks that there may be
   problems with dynamically linked executables/shared libraries with
   the copyback cache.

*) The swapping mechanism has been ported.  You should be able to use
   swap partitions and swap files using "swapon" now (note that the
   kernel prints out some debugging messages whenever a page is
   swapped in or out; these will eventually be removed).

*) Unix domain socket support has been added.

*) The Amiga bootstrap has been changed so that it does not need to be
   loaded into CHIP RAM anymore.  This means that we don't require
   the "BLINK" program when building it.

*) Amiga CHIP RAM now has an allocator.  Existing users of chipram
   have been changed to use this new allocator.

*) Amiga keyboard driver has auto-repeat now.

*) Includes a driver for the Amiga 4000/1200 IDE hard disk controller.
   Thanks to Torsten Ebeling, Michael Rausch and Geert Uytterhoeven
   for separately implementing *3* IDE drivers.  It was hard to decide
   which one to include.  I ended up including the one from Torsten
   since it seemed to fit best into the current source.  I'm hoping
   that Michael and Geert will send in improvements if they have any
   to make.

*) Amiga Mouse driver from Michael Rausch.  Nothing uses this yet.

*) Amiga Parallel Port printer driver from Michael Rausch.

*) VTxxx Terminal Emulation on the console from Arno Griffioen.

*) Bug fixes to the Amiga Fast File System code to allow it to work on
   partitions consisting of an odd number of sectors.

*) Patches from Geert Uytterhoeven to the Amiga Fast File System code
   to allow it to work with the Amiga MultiUser filesystem

*) Support for core files.

*) The "ext2" filesystem has been ported to Linux/68k.  I'm not
   certain of the correctness of this port on largish (>10)
   filesystems yet. Use at your own risk.

*) The "proc" filesystem has been ported to Linux/68k.

*) The "ptrace" support has been ported to Linux/68k.  This allows
   the use of "gdb" to source-level debug programs (this has been
   very useful to me already in tracking down various bugs).

This release still contains only support for the Amiga.  Hopefully the
people working on MacIntosh and Atari support will have some sources
for inclusion soon.

To boot the kernel on an Amiga, use the supplied "bootstrap" command.

To boot with the ram disk image, uncompress the image and type:

  bootstrap -r new-filesys ro

The "ro" option tells the kernel to mount the ramdisk as read-only.
The "/etc/rc" file on the ramdisk image will "check" the ramdisk image
and remount the root (ramdisk) filesystem read/write.  The ramdisk
image contains an "/sbin/shutdown" script which will unmount all
filesystems, mount the ramdisk read-only, sync all dirty buffers, and
then print a message indicating that it is safe to reboot.

You can boot from an existing Linux hard disk partition by supplying
the device name to the bootstrap program:

   bootstrap root=/dev/[sh]d[a-f][1-16]

You may want to provide the "ro" option to mount the partition
read-only.

The major number for SCSI disks is "0x08", and the minor number
depends on the disk and partition. linux/68k searches for SCSI disks
from target 0 to target 7, and for Logical Units 0 through 7 on each
target.  The minor number can be calculated by (disk_number)*16 +
partition_number.  The first disk found is disk 0.  Partition 0 is the
whole disk.  Partition 1 is the first partition found in the
RigidDiskBlock partition table on the Amiga hard disk.  Thus 0x0801 is
the first partition on the first disk found.  0x0812 is the second
partition on the second hard disk found.

For example, I have two SCSI hard disks.  The first is at target 5,
LUN 0 and the second at target 6, LUN 0.  The first has three
partitions (used for Linux) and the second has 4 partitions used for
AmigaDOS.

Thus I have:

   devnum         linux device name

   0x0800         sda  (the entire disk at target 5 : BE CAREFUL)

   0x0802         sda2 (2nd partition on disk at target 5)
   0x0803         sda3 (3rd partition on disk at target 5)
   0x0810         sdb  (the entire disk at target 6 : BE CAREFUL)
   0x0811         sdb1 (1st partition on disk at target 6)
   0x0812         sdb2 (2nd partition on disk at target 6)
   0x0813         sdb3 (3rd partition on disk at target 6)
   0x0814         sdb4 (4th partition on disk at target 6)

*NOTE* The target numbers above are examples; these are what I get on
my system, since the first disk is at target 5 and the second at
target 6.  If your first disk is at target 0, your sda will *still* be
0x0800 (/dev/sda).

My Linux root partition is on the 1st partition of my first drive, so
I boot with:

  bootstrap root=/dev/sda1

After booting from one of the above methods, if the kernel supports
your SCSI driver, you should be able to create a minix file system on
one of your hard disk partitions if you wish.  

Determine the size of your partition in 1K blocks (take the number of
512 byte sectors from HDToolBox and divide by two), and determine
which special file to use in /dev (see above).  *DOUBLE CHECK* that
the major/minor numbers for the special device (ls -l /dev/xxx) are
correct.  If they are incorrect or the device special file doesn't
exist, use mknod to change or create the device special file.  Then
execute:

   /sbin/mkfs.minix /dev/xxxx size

This will create a minix file system on the hard disk partition.  You
can then mount this partition under /mnt and copy files to it:

  mount /dev/xxxx /mnt

When finished copying, unmount the partition:

  umount /mnt

sync a few times, run "/sbin/shutdown" and then reboot.  You can then
boot the kernel by providing "bootstrap" with the device name to boot
from.

Again, you do any mucking around with hard disks at your OWN RISK.

Note that the above can be used on IDE hard disks now also, except
that the major/minor numbers for IDE hard disks are different, and the
special devices in /dev are named hd[ab][1-64].
