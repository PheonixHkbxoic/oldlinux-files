Yes, Rob, I'm sure we could all pick nits for hours and hours, belaboring
all sorts of points (I can easily see one in your paragraph above which I
could question). However, a quick, polite pointer to either an faq or an
appropriate newsgroup would have saved tons of bandwidth on this issue. 
Instead, we've got a lot of people up in a later over what should really
be a minor issue. 

The fact is, there is a persistent bad attitude among some folks here in
Linuxland, one which is repelling rather than attracting new users. 
Perhaps they got trashed when they jumped on the bandwagon, and now
they're passing down the legacy to future generations.  Perhaps they're
just cranky people.  I don't know.  But this useless "fun" of cutting (or
trying to, anyway) newbies to ribbons is just plain pointless and
completely counterproductive. 

Questions, inappropriate and otherwise, are not going to stop.  Like it or
not, as more folks try to join the legions of Linux, there are bound to be
continual pleas for help, and there will be continuous inappropriate
posting.  One can either choose to help the cause, either by polite answer
via email or a polite public prod to the appropriate place, or if you
can't do that, than by hitting the 'n' key and moving on. 

No one helps promote Linux -- much less any product, large or small -- by
insulting new users, of which one can only hope (for Linux's sake) there
will be an endless supply.

I think the bug is in ttwinner.c:

: -----ttwinner.c-----
: #include "ttwinner.h"

: int winner(Board board)
: {
:    int winning = 1, whowins, i = 0;

:    whowins = board[BOARDSIZE/2];
:    for (;i < BOARDSIZE / 2 - 1; i++)
:       winning = winning && (board[i] == whowins)
:                         && (board[BOARDSIZE - 1 - i] == whowins);
:    return (winner && whowins);
             ~~~~~~
             *HERE*
: }
: ----end ttwinner.c----

This statement takes the address of the 'winner' function. It 
probably is a typo, I assume there should be 'winning'. Since 
you perform a _logical_ and between winner and whowins you may 
get false (0) or true (any random nonzero value). The exact value 
of the result probably depends on the adress of the 'winner' 
function, which is different if your programs runs under control
of the debugger or if it doesn't. An other machine (the DECstation) 
will place the 'winner' function at an other address, too.

When winner returns some arbitrarily values, there is a simple
reason why the program just returns $status 1:

: ----- tttest.c (main program) -----
...
: int main(void)
: {
     <definitions>

:    while ((winner(board) == DRAW) && (nummoves != BOARDSIZE))
:    {
          <loop-body>
:    }
:    if (winner(board) == HUMAN)
:       puts("You won, it wasn't that hard since you made all the moves");
:    if (winner(board) == COMPUTER)
:       puts("I won, obviously a result of my suprior intellect.");
:    if (winner(board) == DRAW)
:       puts("You played all the moves, and you could still only manage a tie!");
: }

If winner(board) returns some random value, which is different from
DRAW, HUMAN and COMPUTER, neither the while loop nor any of the if
statements will be executed. main() will just be left, without any
return value set. When none is set, some random value is used (what-
ever is left in some processor register or the memory)

( BTW: If you use gcc compile with the  -Wall  switch. gcc will then
  emit a warning 'control reaches end of non-void function' which
  means the same as 'you forgot to add a return() to this function' )

It is advisable to use assert in all your programs, since it will
help you find bugs like these. assert() terminates the program and
reports the source file and line number if the expression passed to
it evaluates false.

ASSERT:    ( Include <assert.h> at the top of the program. )

:    if (winner(board) == HUMAN)
:       puts("You won, it wasn't that hard since you made all the moves");
:    if (winner(board) == COMPUTER)
:       puts("I won, obviously a result of my suprior intellect.");
:    if (winner(board) == DRAW)
:       puts("You played all the moves, and you could still only manage a tie!");
     assert( winner(board)==HUMAN || winner(board)==COMPUTER 
             || winner(board)==DRAW );
  
I learned to use assert() the hard way: Debugging programs some people
wrote, that are literally computer illiterate. (No pun intended)
Using assert() often helps much to draw one's attention to the real
bug.

Subject: write() on a tty with O_NONBLOCK set (was Re: pre1.0 strange behaviour)
Date: Wed, 9 Mar 1994 06:30:15 GMT

In article <2ldcmn$3o@brasil.fr.mugnet.org>, Laurent Chemla
<laurent@brasil.frmug.fr.net> wrote:

    Now the bad news. I'm writing a program that places the text cursor where it
    wants on the screen. Stdin is in O_NONBLOCK mode, but stdout is not.
    The cursor does no more react the same way it was used to until I upgrade
    from pl15h to ALPHA1.0.

You say that stdout doesn't have O_NONBLOCK set, but I'm pretty
sure that it does.  The reason why I say that is that getty_ps
and agetty, two of the most popular getty's, create stdout and
stderr from stdin using dup().  That means that if you set
O_NONBLOCK on stdin, it will also be set on stdout and stderr.
You must be using one of these two getty's, or one that works
similarly.

AND, more importantly!  As of pl15i, if you write() to a tty,
O_NONBLOCK is set, and not all of the data could be queued for
transmission, the write() will not block and will return how many
characters it was able to queue.  This will be less than the
requested amount, and is what's known as a "partial write".  If
no characters could be queued, write() will return -1 and set
errno to EAGAIN.

Previous kernels ignore O_NONBLOCK, so partial writes don't
happen and you don't get this behavior.

This seems to be causing problems somewhere, either in the stdio
code (most likely) or in your program.

    NOTE that it does work allright on the console screen, but it just seems to
    be fooled on any of my serial terminals, at any speed. If i'm on ttyS4
    (for instance) and then just enter 'myprogram' then it doesn't work, but if
    I enter 'myprogram > /dev/ttyS4' then it does work!
    A 'stty -a' shows that rows and columns are set to 0 when I log in on a
    serial terminal, but it always did. And when I enter a 'tset' command, rows
    and columns are correct but it doesn't change anything.

The change to the handling of O_NONBLOCK is more likely to affect
serial lines than consoles.  The reason is that when requested by
the write() code, consoles can always transmit the requested data
to the screen.  Serial lines, on the other hand, can initially
transmit only as much as the UART's buffer is willing to hold,
and this can be as little as one byte.  The kernel notices that
not all the requested data was transmitted, and attempts to block
until the serial driver indicates that the data was finally
written to the device.  If O_NONBLOCK is set, it won't block and
causes a partial write.

The reason why it works when you use a '>' is that the tty is
opened from scratch, so it doesn't have O_NONBLOCK set.  In
fact, as a workaround for your program, fopen() /dev/tty and use
that instead of stdout.  Or turn off O_NONBLOCK while you're not
reading from the tty.
                                        -=- julian

 You're absolutely right! After some digging I found those new lines in the
write_chan() kernel routine, so I must admit my stdout is set O_NONBLOCK.

 You're right again, but the point is my program doesn't use write() at all.
It only uses fputc() and fputs() calls, and those calls can't test EAGAIN as
this condition may occurs anywhere during the flush of the previous 1024
bytes that were sent. So the question becomes "Should I allways explicitely
open my tty using non-blocking I/O if I want to use those calls, or should
the library handle this trick, always using non-blocking I/O when outputing
data though putchar(), putc(), fputc(), fputs() etc.. ?".

 I'm not a good C programmer. In fact, I'm an Atari "assembler only"
programmer :-) so please don't flame me if this question is not a good one.
Just tell me.

Laurent.

Subject: USing PPP or CLSIP through stupid terminal servers
Date: 8 Mar 94 07:05:12 GMT

Ok I have an idea and I'm just checking to see if anyone else has
done this.  The situation is this.  Our terminal server escapes
codes 13 17 19 141 143 145 147 and 155, making slip or PPP useless.
I can run term thorugh this connection and get upload rates of 1650
cps on binary files using term's compression with a 14400 modem.
(I don;t know why this is since I think gzip does a good job at
compressing files.)  SO here is the idea.  Modify trshell so that
you can login and start up ppp on the remote machine.  pppd will take
over the pseudo tty just fine and output junk to term and it will
show up on your local temrinal.  Then modify trshell so that if it receives
a special escape code it will open a master and slave pty and just 
exachange infor coming from terms port with the tty master.
Then you can run ppd on your local machine and give the pty that
you opened in the modified trshell.  PPP or slip for that matter 
can then run in clean 8-bit mode and never see the terminal server.
Sure there will be a few bytes wasted using term, but term;s compression
seems pretty good, and I wouldn;t mind the slow down to say 1600 cps. (-:
If someone has done anything like this, please send me E-mail right
away.  I am going to start work on this project a week from today and
would rather not duplicate any work.

Hallo everybody outthere without having problems :-)

First I have no problems to install the Adaptec Controller. There are two harddisk
drives which are wellknown to the controller. After booting Linux the harddisks
are mountable and  work with them seems normal. The only problem that I have
occures if I try to copy files to the drives. The error occures on changing positions
therefore it is unpredictable wether the filecontens is the same as in the original or
not. The copy methods are rcp, ftp, via nfs or only cp on the same drive. The datasize
is about 70Megs. Sometimes the computer hangs during the copy process. It isn't then
possible to kill the process and the following reboot process sometimes hangs too. 
Under DOS the controller drive combination works marvelous. I don't know is it
a electrical problem (cable etc.) or problem with the filesystem or a problem with
settings on contoller or drive (soft or hard) or a problem with myself.

My configuration:

Or I could sed out what I don't want, or as I have done, replaced the @
with an @@ - sed to the rescue. It really doesn't matter one way or the
other. My point was that, as far as I can determine, I saw this the first
time when I installed pre-1.0 and my getty has not changed.

I have come across an apparent problem with the select system call. 

According to the specification, if select is given a non-zero timeout then
the system call is supposed to wait for the appropriate interval before 
terminating.

Well it doesnt! If you give a non-zero timeout the nit comes back immediately.

I know that this is not my problem, because the same (i.e. identical) program
behaves as expected on a sun sparc under suno 4.1.13.

Are there any known fixes for this?

ppp.c routine it gives a message that its not implemented yet.

When will this be? is someone working on it?

The main advantage of dip over chat is that the script language

Let's get real now! For 1 line at 2400bps noone needs a 16550 UART. Heck, even
MS-Windoze will work without it on a slow computer...

Subject: Loaded fonts discarded after X vt switch...
Date: 09 Mar 1994 11:35:59 GMT

I've noticed that if I use setfont to change the console font,
then use X Windows, the loaded font is discarded and the standard
font reinstalled.  Does anyone have any idea how we might modify
the kernel to restore the loaded font after switching out of a
graphics vt?

Thanks,

Ray.

p.s., I've made a load of fonts suitable for use with setfont
from the vga/fontpak.zip file on simtel20.  Anyone have
recommendations for where I should put them?

Well actually no.. That got take out of context of the other half of the 
discussion (I should have quoted more). I wouldn't buy it because I don't
think smart serial boards are cost effective compared with just using
16550A UARTS and upping your motherboard spec.

Now I am aware that they were talking about the generic on board kernel
then I see no problem, as I said in another message. In fact this is
the same as some modems running under Linux.

INADDR_ANY is counted as a broadcast address in Linux. Which is where this
is coming from. Earlier pl15 systems also mistakenly return ENETUNREACH
not EACCESS as BSD does for broadcast write without having set SO_BROADCAST.
I wasn't aware that a sendto() of INADDR_ANY had a special semantic in BSD.
I'll check this.

BSD only does this for 'fatal' errors. The internet RFC's are fairly specific
that _all_ ICMP errors ought to be reported to the end user process. I'm still
open to comments on this one, but security considerations certain favour
following the RFC not BSD code.

If you want BSD behaviour then change inet/udp.c:udp_err() so the line

        sk->err = icmp_error_convert[err & 0xff].errno;
has
        if(icmp_error_convert[err&0xff].fatal)
        
before it.

I'm not sure I know what you are seeing here. Care to elaborate.

This problem comes up in the news from time to time.  It is generally
beleived to be a hardware problem.  Please describe your hardware...
(CPU type and maker, motherboard, RAM amount and speed)

But the contents of the version file has sometimes changed...
