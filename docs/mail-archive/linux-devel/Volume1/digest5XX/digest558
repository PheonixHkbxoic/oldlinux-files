If you are running anything earlier than real 1.0 then get 1.0 if you have
telnet hangs. Only if they continue after that start to worry and file
bug reports. Charles Hedrick and Linus pretty much butchered and rewrote
the TCP layer between pl14n and 1.00

There is no good answer to this problem.  Part of the reason it exists to
begin with is that comp.os.linux.development is badly named because a lot
of people wanted to be "cute" and have the abbreviation come out c.o.l.d.
(otherwise, they would have been more sensible and just named the group
comp.os.linux.kernel, which *clearly* refers to linux kernel development,
which is actually this group's charter).  So now they, and a lot of other
people, are paying for this original urge to be "cute".  The answer to this
is really quite simple, of course: create comp.os.linux.kernel, and move
all kernel discussion there, while retaining comp.os.linux.development for
what it appears it should be for: software development issues under Linux.
Screw the newsgroup creation rules, there's *good reason* to do this (User
Interface Issues 101), and rules shouldn't *ever* just blindly apply.

Of course, that's not all of it.  Much of the problem is that people who
want answers will post to whatever newsgroup they find to be most convenient,
instead of posting to whatever newsgroup is appropriate.  However, the answer
to this is not as much of a no-brainer as you might think.  Many times, the
question being asked can legitimately be asked in at least two newsgroups.
Is an XFree configuration question more properly asked on comp.windows.x,
comp.os.linux.help, comp.os.linux.admin, or what?  How do you know going
into it whether the question is Linux-specific or not?  There are a *lot* of
questions that are even harder to categorize.

Another facet of the problem is that the traffic on comp.os.linux.help is
*tremendous*.  How likely do you think it is that someone who really knows
what they're talking about will get to your question within a day if you
ask it there?  If it's an oft-asked question, many of the responses will
be along the lines of "I'd like to know, too".  At least on c.o.l.d., you're
likely to be talking to people who really know what's going on.  If *I* had
a question that I wanted to be sure to get a good answer to, I'd email
someone I knew was likely to have the answer.  This is based on my experience
with posting questions to newsgroups.  Even for *appropriate* questions,
I've had trouble getting answers to my questions on this newsgroup (c.o.l.d.).
Case in point: up to at least 0.99.13, there seems to be a problem with stack
integrity in the core dump file written as a result of a SIGABRT that
originated in the process that was signalled (most often from abort()).
I haven't characterized this with other signals, so don't offhand know if
it's a general problem or one specific to SIGABRT (conjecture: it's a problem
with any signal that causes core to be dumped).  I asked *twice* about this
problem here on c.o.l.d. and got *zero* responses, and this is *obviously*
the right group to ask the question on.  My questions were separated by a
couple of months.  Someone else managed to ask the same question.  He likely
got no responses as well.  I have a workaround: kill the process from another
process, i.e. have your abort() code do a fork() and kill the parent from the
child.  But this isn't implemented in the library, so anything using the
library code will produce an almost useless core dump (experience says that
the stack image is one of the most important pieces of debugging information
contained in the core dump).

Some of us, like myself, ask very few questions to the net.  This isn't
because we respect newsgroup charters, read the FAQ, or any other such
thing (though those things happen to be true).  It's because we happen to
be capable enough to peruse the source to find the answers to our questions
if we have to.  This is how I managed to get screen to work on my system (a
while back.  I don't know if newer versions work out of the box).  It took
a few hours, but I didn't have to go to the newsgroup to find my answers
(it would take a few days, at least, for me to figure out the core dump
problem, which is why I haven't bothered).  But folks, this is *not* a
common capability, and you'll continue to be perturbed by the volume of
"newbie" questions until you realize this!!  This is particularly true if
you don't even answer the *expert* questions, like the core dump question.

In any case, if someone asks a question on the newsgroup that happens to be
inappropriate, how long does it take to figure out that you can just skip it?
A couple of seconds?  If you're using a *real* newsreader, like trn, then
you can often just skip the thread based on the subject line (I know this
often doesn't work, however).  You might spend 1 minute out of 30 or so
skipping newbie questions, and that's on a *bad* day.  Is it really worth
it, then, to get all up in arms about an inappropriate posting?

Not everyone has as much of a clue as you might.  If they did, there would
be a lot fewer questions (inappropriate or not) being asked.

Subject: Fork fails - what's the problem??!?
Date: Wed, 16 Mar 1994 07:10:46 GMT

I'm having the problem that I fork fails, usually after about 41 processes
running (about 15 for root, the rest for my normal login).  I thought for 
a long time that I had reached the max procs per unpriviledged user, so
I went the route of bumping up the NR_TASKS in tasks.h, and rebuilt the
kernel.  Same problem.  Over and over.

Tonight fork failed at around 33 processes, so I don't really know what's
up.  This happened as it often does when I'm trying open a new xterm window
and run some program in it (tonight that was elvis).

Is it possible that I'm hitting some other resource limit, for example, the
max # of ptys, when fork/exec tries to set up stdin/stdout for the new 
process?

Any help in solving this problem would be very much appreciated.  I've got
the RAM, I've got the MIPS, but I ain't got the processes...

Subject: Interesting use of "buffers" in new Linux 1.0 (+ late pl15)
Date: 16 Mar 1994 07:55:45 GMT


I've noticed something interesting about Linux's use of memory lately.
In specific, I'm referring to Linux's use of the buffer cache
(reported by "free" command as the buffers category).

I've noticed that starting with pseudo-late pl15 and 1.0, my buffers
never seems to decrease below 3000.  Is this what it's supposed to do?
Wouldn't it make more sense to use this buffers to store real things
in memory rather than start using swap to swap things out, while
maintaining the cache?  It's interesting that this change was 
made suddently amidst the pl15 series (where nothing was supposed
to change except for bug fixes).

Anyone else notice this?

This assumption is wrong.  127 is specified in the RFCs as being a pseudo-
network that includes the loopback address.  The fact that it is specified
in the RFCs as a special address pretty well contradicts your premise.

The difference is that the IP layer can make the correct decision not to put
anything to 127.* on any external interface.  The idea that someone should
need to configure their system to not violate the RFCs is ridiculous.  There
is a large responsibility on the part of the stack to not allow stupid things
like sending 127.* out on the net.

You really should research these issues before posting.  For starters, see
the Hosts Requirements RFC.  There is indeed something "magical" about any
address on the 127 net.  Whether you set your system up with 127.0.0.1 as a
loopback or not is your problem.  No matter what, you should never send
packets to 127.anything out any interface, regardless of the routing table's
(mis)configuration.

A better replacement for nslookup is DIG. It works fine on
my linux 0.99.14 box, which we use as firewall machine too.
Since I have DIG I haven't used nslookup anymore. Get it !

Well, I noticed with some pl15 kernel, that the buffers would not 
go below half of the memory I had.  This was real bad, when doing
memory extensive work under X.  With pre-1.0, it went away, again.
Linux still seems to give more priority to buffers, than it used
to be before, but this is ok.

I think, it is a good idea to have more buffers than just a minimum.
Otherwise, the kernel will read the same blocks (like currently
used inodes and directories) again and again.  Better do some
swapping instead.

You're both right. The combination of the kernel noting that nobody uses
the port, and the subsequent reset of the port by getty, should, however,
return the port to usability.

If not, I'd regard that as a kernel bug.

Actually, I'm using "dig". It can do everything that nslookup can do,
except zone transfers -- and these are better with named-xfer anyway.

You're ignoring the fact that kmalloc is callable from an interrupt and may

Probably because the only user of kmalloc at interrupt time is networking,
and most people simply don't talk to their CD-ROM and receive large network
messages, which are most likely to cause a reuse of the block, at the same
time.
