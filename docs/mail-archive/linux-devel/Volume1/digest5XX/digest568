Concerning SLIP (and dip)

Here's the background:
I would like to run SLIP over telnet. (ie, telnet from a dialup annex to
a SLIP server running linux) and the SLIP server I have put together 
seems to hang the pty's when I run a dip -i. This is bad, because this 
machine is meant to serve as a SLIP server for several people.
The sympton is that I can no longer telnet into the box. When I try,
it gives me a quick normal-looking prompt and then closes the connection.
Wehn it does this, I have to go to the building where the box is, and kill
the dip from the console. Ugly. 

Now, I have tried killing the slip interface and the route to it, and that
doesn't help. I am thinking it has something to do with setting the line
discipline. Does this sound reasonable? More importantly, is there a way
I can modify dip to not do this?

(For this installation, running SLPI over term isn't an option... the 
server is a five meg machine running off of a floppy...

is this something with the kernel, or the net2 stuff, or with dip?

Thanks...

I agree, something along these lines is a good way to go. I'd like to see
the Linux kernel abstracted somehwat for porting to other architectures;
at the very least, moving assembly code out of the source proper. (Although
there are many algorithmic things that are tuned to the x86). In theory,
then, to port the heart of the kernel to another architecture you would 
only need to rewrite the `far back end' routines (task management, etc.) 
for that architecture. Of course, there are many other problems associated
with that: For one thing, the core data structures would change across the
board (such as task_struct) and interrupt handling would be greatly different.
Then you're faced with the problem of porting device drivers to the new 
hardware. This is not an easy task for ANY kernel; most popular commercial 
UNIXes (SunOS, etc.) are tailored to a particular platform. 

I don't want to see the Linux kernel be abstracted to the point where it's
no longer optimized for the x86. However, some of the code can be organized
to (attempt to) separate the machine dependencies from the abstract algorithms.
Unfortunately x86 assumptions run throughout the kernel, and abstracting those
any further would undoubtedly complicate things considerably.

I put in symbolic link /usr/lib/libl.a -> /usr/lib/libfl.a
This is preferable to modifying makefiles, especially if you
are working on something for many OS's.  Maybe this link should be
added into new distributions?

You may also need to add the -l flag to provide maximum compatability
with lex.  Do a man on "flex" or "flexdoc" for more information.

Another Idea:  How about a lex script containing "/usr/bin/flex -l $*"
   instead of a symbolic link?

... When you do, it should take the form:
#ifndef i386
  simple {
    c;
    substitute();
  }
#else
  high
  speed
  assembly
  hack
#endif

A good example is in linux/drivers/sound/audio, except they chose
to use #ifdef NO_INLINE_ASM instead of #ifndef i386.
I would like to see the fast file name compares in the file system
directories pulled out into a construct like this, and since they
all do about the same thing, it can go into a common asm/ include.

Personally, I don't have any grand hopes that "Linux" will become
a mainstream OS for anything other than x86 machines.  OTOH, the
code base it has generated (and is continuing to generate) is real,
and will have a lasting effect on *nix for all machines.

The Linux vt code moves the start of the screen forward in the display
buffer to do scrolling. This gives a limited scrollback buffer if you
need it. You are mmapping an area ofthe diplay memory that wil not be
visible if there has been any scrolling. Shift pgup/pgdn I think, to scroll.

However, switching vts clears this buffer and the display is
reset to 0xb8000 again. Thus your code works again.

Reply-To: arnoudm@ijssel.hacktic.nl

Hi

I got the backspace patch for getty_ps2.0.7c from sunsite, The
patch basically outputs two backspaces on the tty instead of one
when type the backspace key. It seems a stupid hack to me and
moreover, after applying the patch the charcters still aren't
erased, very annoying if you are a bad typist ;-).

So I looked at the terminal setting that getty uses to open the
line. It sets the tty-line to non-canonical mode, ignoring the
flags in gettydefs on this matter. I fail to see the reason for
this and after I set the line back to canonical mode (either
using stty or modifying the code) the backspace key works as
expected: it deletes one character from the buffer and from the
screen.

Could somebody explain me why getty opens the line using with the
ICANON flag disabled (this happens in funcs.c line 268)? And why
is the backspace not echoed when the line is in non-canonical
mode ?

Gtx:

But it wasn't using interrupts.  And you could not run something else

Shared interrupts only work when the hardware allows it.  So you must use
a multiport card which can share interrupts.
Jumpering several card's to the same interrupt won't work.  This
is a PC hardware limitation, which cannot be solved in software.

I advise you to first do some study before you think you can do better
that this.  The quoted article contains several misconceptions.

The IDE interfaces on virtually all (except some rare new systems) systems
do not include DMA hardware support.  Neither do most IDE drives themselves.

The linux IDE driver (hd.c) completely blocks all interrupts during data
xfers.  This will change Real Soon Now, after my patches soak for another week.
If you want to try them out, look for the << IDE Performance Package >> patch
posted last week to comp.os.linux.development.

When we got a machine with that filesystem, we thought "let's see how
that performs".

Made a filesystem and mounted it under /mnt
Then:

        (cd /usr/lib/terminfo; tar cf -) | (cd /mnt; tar xvf -)

When it was happily copying the files: break the power.

Result: the filesystem was "recovered" but there were several 0-sized
copied files near the point where the copy was when the power dropped.

Ok, the output filesystem was not corrupted, but it certainly was not
in a consistent state.  (I would have expected those 0-sized files to
simply have vanished, as their data was not written ok)

Less-demanding tests gave better results, and it was still considered
a good thing.
