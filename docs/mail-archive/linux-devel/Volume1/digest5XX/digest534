This program defeats Linux's ``don't grab all the memory'' heuristic.
Linus did say that it would be possible to defeat, and this does it.

The good news is that it doesn't actually die -- eventually (have a
coffee :-) the process gets killed by the system.

Yes. Read the documentation. You're reusing your timeout values.
The first time you call select(), it zeroes the variable because no more
time is remaining. The next time you're calling select(), the variable is
still zero.

This is mentioned in both the SunOS and Linux manpages for select().

I assume you are using getty_ps, which interprets certain @-character
sequences and replaces them with things like hostname, number of users
logged in etc. @k is probably not defined, so it is simply stripped.
(I cannot check this out since I currently do not have acces to my
 Linux box, which is at home in Germany :-( )
So this has nothing to do with pre-1.0.

Greg, thank you for the detailed information. I also had the Ghostscript
initialization problem with an AMD 486DX2-66, datecode 9342FPW / Malaysia.
It didn't matter which operating system I used. Same behaviour under
ISC 3.0 and Linux 0.99.14i. The OS/2 version of ghostscript gets initialized,
but the output is sometimes nonsense. It looks like rounding errors, as you
pointed out in your test program. Swapping to an Intel CPU fixed all the
problems.

Hope AMD will change all the buggy CPUs.

Subject: ** Bug in hp.c HPLAN driver **


Hi Donald,

 
   Yesterday I installed the slackware 1.1.2 distribution of Linux (
Patrick your setup is marvellous !!) on my 486/33T machine (this is an 
HP EISA machine). Everything went smoothly except that my HP27247A
ethertwist machine was not recognized. So I went through hp.c (0.99.15c) and
discovered a few things :

========
hp_probe
========

Here is the beginning of the function:

int hp_probe(struct device *dev)
{
        int *port, ports[] = {0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x280, 0x2C0, 0x200, 0x240, 0
        short ioaddr = dev->base_addr;

        if (ioaddr > 0x1ff)               /* Check a single specified loca
                return hpprobe1(dev, ioaddr);
        else if (ioaddr > 0)              /* Don't probe at all. *
                return ENXIO;

[lines deleted]

}

The second test on ioaddr is wrong ! It's exactly the opposite  (ioaddr < 0)
that must be done.

=========
hp_probe1
=========

PROBLEM #1
==========

Before I start using the machine mention aboved (EISA machine) I had no
problem with the autoirq code but it looks like on EISA architecture the
way you twinkle the interrupts doesn't work :

        /* Twinkle the interrupt, and check if it's seen....*/
    outb_p(irqmap[irq] | HP_RUN, ioaddr + HP_CONFIGURE);
    outb_p( 0x00 | HP_RUN, ioaddr + HP_CONFIGURE);

I don't know why but that is how it goes. So what I did is that I added a
piece of code to get an IRQ with request_irq() like that:

                                do {
                  [lines deleted]
                } while (*++irqp);
 
                if (*irqp == 0) {
                    int *irqp = irq_8list;
                    do {
                        int irq = *irqp;
                        if (request_irq (irq, &ei_interrupt) == 0) {
                               printk(" (non auto) selecting IRQ %d.\n"
                               dev->irq = *irqp;
                               break;
                        }
                    } while (*++irqp);

                    if (*irqp == 0) {
                         printk(" no free IRQ lines.\n");
                         return EBUSY;
                    }

                }

Of course this is not ideal but it works. The drivers grabs the first free
IRQ (7 on my machine because I don't have LPT2) and that's it.

The ideal solution would be to find a way to twinkle the IT that would work
on any platform. Any idea ?

If you want me to test a new method of yours, feel free to send your hp.c
to me.


PROBLEM #2
==========

The second problem is about the irq_16list you use when the driver detects
an HP27247A board. 

                int irq_16list[] = { 11, 10, 5, 3, 4, 7, 9, 0};
                int irq_8list[] = { 7, 5, 3, 4, 9, 0};

I have the Hardware reference guide of this board at hand and IRQ 11 and 
IRQ 10 (map into option register value 2 and 12) are mentioned as "Not
used". So is there a reason why you use this 16 bit list ? may be my doc'
is not up to date.

On top of that if I remember well, when I was using my old 386 ISA machine
with the same HP27247A board, the auto detection of the interrupt lead the 
driver to select IRQ 5 meaning that IRQ 11 and 10 never worked.


It was my $0.01 contribution to Linux.

Have a nice day. Cheers.
Laurent

: INADDR_ANY is counted as a broadcast address in Linux. Which is where this
: is coming from. Earlier pl15 systems also mistakenly return ENETUNREACH

Looking at the RFC's I think it should actually be invalid, as should anything not
a class A, B, C or D address. (Currently any invalid addresses including class
E ones are likely to get sent to the default router, which is probably not 
a good idea). This check also applies to the destination of any received datagrams
(as well as an additional check that 127.X.X.X only came from the loop back device)
and any source routes.

Theoretically these should not be necessary, but they do conform to the guide line
of "Assume that the network is full of hostile entities"

I suspect it actually only does this the SECOND time you call select.
What Linux does is to write to the variable used. So if you need to use
select inside any kind of loop you need a variable specifically for the timeout,
which you set to the appropriate value before calling select. i.e. use in 
exactly the same way as the fd_set values.

Date: 8 Mar 1994 17:38:42 -0800

I'm getting an error that I've never seen before when compiling a certain
appliction.  What happens is that after I've compiled all the object files
for the application and start linking the application with the library
I made, gcc reports an internal error which I've never encountered before.

Here is what happens when I type `make':

make: *** [app] Error 1

What could cause ld to receive signal 11 (ie SIGSEGV )?  Is the compiler
trying to access a symbol name outside of the library's text segment?

If this was due to an error in my code, I would expect the error to show up
during compilation of the module, or during run-time of the app.

I am using these versions of compiler, linker, etc.:

        gcc 2.5.8
        libc 4.5.21
        ld 1.9l.3

Has anyone else ever had this problem?  I'd like to know if it is a common
problem.

If you change all printf("%f...) to printf ("%3.8f...")
you will see:

1.31250000 * 7.99989986 =10.49986839
1.31250000 * 7.99990000 =10.49986875
Test Failed, this must be an AMD 486DX chip!

There is no CPU bug. The only thing is that the number 7.9999
can not be stored in the float format without loosing precision.
