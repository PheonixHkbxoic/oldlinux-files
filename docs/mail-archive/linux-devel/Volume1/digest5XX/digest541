Again, you were not doing just fine in previous kernels:  you
were merely blissfully unaware of what was happening.  Many of
the better file transfer protocols were not visibly affected
because they detected the errors and asked for the damaged
packets to be resent.

I think it should be possible to kill it earlier by using ulimit.

(e.g. ulimit -m 1000)

I ran into the same thing a few days ago.  It seems to be a hardware
problem, but I couldn't narrow it down to an exact cause.  As far as I
could tell there was something quirky about the CPU board in an HP
Vectra RS/20C (386DX-20 with 387 and cache).  Exact same installation
with a slightly different CPU board (RS/16 -- 386DX-16, no 387, no
cache) never had the problem.  Same video board, same disk controller
and disk.

Others have reported the infamous "sig 11" as being solved by:

  + new disk controller
  + slowing bus speed from 8MHz to something lower
  + flakey SIMM

Subject: [Possible bug?] rm * on write-protected dos floppy
Date: 11 Mar 1994 20:19:53 GMT

The following procedure illustrates a bug on my system:

I mount a 3.5 inch *write protected* floppy using
   mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt
and then do 
   cd /mnt; rm *    (as root)
ls reports that all files on the disk have been removed.  There
are no error messages.  If the floppy is dismounted and then
remounted, the files are, of course, still there.  If I copy
a large file to the floppy, which was almost full, the copy fails
with an out of space message.  If I wait long enough update (or
whatever program does this) eventually notices the situation and
a further ls displays all of the files on the floppy.

I would think that some sort of error message about attempting
a write operation on a write protected disk would be appropriate.
Previous versions (0.99pl14) did give some immediate feedback.

I am running an essentially virgin Slackware 1.1.2 installation
with 0.99pl15b.

You can ftp Modula-3 for Linux from gatekeeper.dec.com.  Look in
"pub/DEC/Modula-3/release-3.1".

When I installed it on my Linux box a couple weeks ago, there were
problems with the thread switching software.  I don't know if they've

Actually it stored a whopping 140k.  From the description you give, it
didn't work much like the Amiga at all.  It worked more like the 800k
Mac 3.5" floppies except being constant spindle speed, and single sided.
Both are based on GCR encoding instead of MFM.

At any rate, this topic is getting _way_ off track for this news group
unless someone is really serious about writing utilities to read these
disk formats on Linux, which I doubt.  If anyone is interested though, I
have an Apple ][ emulator which runs under Linux...  although you have
to make 140k disk image files for it, since PC floppy drives can't
normally read Apple ][ disks without some hardware help.

Are you sure about this?  I will have to check the service manuals...  Maybe
the very recent "new" SuperDrive mechanisms change this (the cheapo ones made
my Matsushita).  I'm pretty sure that all of the older Sony SuperDrive
mechanisms have the variable spindle speed capability.  It is true that in
1.4M mode they are constant speed.  Its just plain harder to tell on the
SuperDrives in general because they are much quieter than the old 800k
mechanisms were.

Count me as having an abnormal mind then :-)  I always found the WM circuit

As the one who originally wrote the code-page (font) handling for
Linux, I'm really surprised to see that the standard kernel no longer
supports different fonts for each VT.  I tend to work with Russian and
Hebrew in additional to English, and there's no way to put all three
into one font, as the Hebrew and Russian encodings overlap.  So I NEED
different fonts on different VT's.

Who made this decision?  I understand the code was rewritten (which is
probably a good thing, because I'm a Pascal programmer, and don't
really know C....), but why was the behavior changed?

You can always mount the boot disk and copy /vmlinuz (I think that's
the name of the kernel file).

However, this kernel has a ramdisk (which will just take memory and be
rather useless for HD use) and lots of unnecessary drivers.

I really suggest going into /usr/src/linux, saying
make config;make dep;make clean;make zlilo
and get a kernel going which is just what you need. This is not too
complicated, is it? Although it will take half the night, most of which
without maintenance.

Oh, probably you should read the README in /usr/src/linux before.

Alan is 100% correct. Its even worse than what he says too, the Amiga
also does not pay any attention to where on the disk the track starts.
It just sucks all the flux transitions into memory, then uses its
blitter to find the start/end of track.  By having only one sector
without all the overhead of start/sync bits the Amiga was able to get
880K/floppy instead of 760K.  This means that the track starts in a
random location, rather than the 'real' track start that the drive
indicates (using a hole in 5.25" disks, and I assume position of the
disk motor in 3.5")

As far as the hard/soft sectoring goes, that is referring to some
really old drives.  Hard sectored drives had a small hole to mark each
sector, and a large hole to mark the track beginning.  Soft sectored
drives only have a hole to mark the track beginning.  (rotate a 5.25"
disk looking at the smaller hole in the middle to see what I'm talking
about)

Another weird disk drive was the old Apple ][ drive.  It also payed no
attention to the track hole, you could use both hard and soft sectored
disks in it.  Probably used the same trick the Amiga does because it
had about 20% more capacity than other drives of the same class, a
whopping 102K.

You were getting tty overruns whith 0.95 and more as well.

The reason why you notice them now is that the message appeared to be
printed as of one of the PL14 alpha patches.

Before that, overruns were here but were counted as other more general
serial errors (parity, frame) and no message was printed by the kernel.

If you don't want to plug a 16550, just comment the code printing this
message, your kernel will work as previous ones. (No 'overrun' message
printed, and the communication protocols managing to transfer files
proprely by retrying on some packets)

A very useful thing for the kernel developpers when you get a crash like
this is to read what Linus says in the /usr/src/linux/README file, and
give some information about where the kernel seemed to die, by running "nm"
on the tools/zSystem file, since all kernels are different, only you have
the right file after you compiled your system.
