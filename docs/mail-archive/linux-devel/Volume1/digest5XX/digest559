        I'm using the netstat from net 0.32, and I've experienced this with
a program that tried to select() a file descriptor that should have been
treated as a connection refused, but didn't for some reason.  Here's what I get
dumped by the kernel upon the segmentation fault the program(s) receive:

From: cdh@specialix.co.uk (Alan Drew)

Well my last post certainly seems to have stirred up a hornets nest.

Most suprising though is the number of people who have come forward
and offered to do the work. Some of you saw the original offer some
of you didn't.

So.... Here's the position.....

We currently have one gentleman working on the driver. I fully intend
to leave him to get on with it (he was projecting end of march) and see
what comes up. If nothing happens (which is a possibility as there has
been radio silence from him since he was sent the Tech Ref), then I will
sit down with our technical director in a few months time and review
the whole situation all over again.

In the meantime, I have tried to reply to all those who e-mailed me
though I may heve missed a few (please forgive me if such is the case).

I will keep all your names on file, though I am more likely to
come back here again with an open offer and await your reply.

A usefull exercise for any interested parties which would
give me some usfull amunition with the powers that be, here.
Is for one of you guys to do some *real* market research and
try and find out just how many people *really* want this type
of driver and how many ports they want to use it with.

----
Further information, if anybody is interested, we have a product called
IO8+, this is *NOT* an intelligent IO controller, but it does provide
you with 8 RS232 RJ12 socket devices backed up by a very good Cirrus
UART. All you need to write a driver for this is the Cirrus Logic
Chip reference manual for the CD1864 and the IO addresses (set on the card).
You can have multiple host cards in your system. This may be a better
solution for those of you who want 8-16 ports + 2 COM: ports. The driver
would not be hugely different from that of a 16550 driver. One thing
is though, you woldn't have the performance to run 8 SLIP lines at
115.2K BAud

:)

As usual feel free to contact me with any questions or comments

Hello,

Where can I get the IV 3.1 sources for Linux? I like to have the sources
of the complete distribution, including the libs and the examples (like
idraw, ibuild and iclass). I am running Slackware 1.1.2, which includes
the IV 3.1 libs and includes (but no sources).
So, does anybody know where I can get these? Or who did port the IV 3.1
distribution to Linux? Maybe he/she can upload the sources to sunsite.unc.edu ..
Thanks in advance,

All those things are in the andrew61prog.tar.gz file.  We hope that soon
after AUIS 6.3 is released on the X11R6 tape there will be a properly
segmented binary release available elsewhere.  (Most likely replacing
6.1 on sunsite at least.)  The 6.1 release wasn't prepared by us,
probably the 6.3 binary release will not be either.  (Though we will
offer guidance to someone we know who plans to do it.)

hi -- i want to use my linux box to boot a diskless Sun to run as an
Xterminal (using the XKernel) to talk to the linux box.  (with me so far?)

to do this, i need a RARP server, since Sun's don't do bootp.  to port the
netbsd RARPD, i need the berkeley packet filter (bpf).

has anyone put a rarpd on linux?

has anyone put the Berkeley Packet Filter on linux?

is there are raw network access point (i.e. /dev/nit) on linux?

should i just hack the single entry i need into the arp code in my kernel,
to get me running well enough to finish doing the job right, so i can
contribute the changes back to posterity?  (don't answer that...)

(as a secondary question, has bootparamd been ported to linux?)

Solaris 2.2 has a Real Time Scheduler. Would be nice to have that in Linux.

Did your pl15 setup have more than the usual 8 VTs compiled in like mine
does (I use 12) ? This would account for it if you didn't change the value
of NR_CONSOLES in /usr/include/linux/tty.h when you installed 1.0

I'm not so sure about that. Many people like collect all special
file-systems and all other special things in their kernel. Even I
have ISO filesystem in my kernel, and I don't even have CD-Rom.
Anyway, sometimes you can get sofware on other format floppies
then msdos, and I'm ready then. (I think, and I hope).

Subject: struct icmp definition? (which icmp.h)
Date: Wed, 16 Mar 1994 03:24:30 -0500

I ftp'd the net-2 sources from tsx-11 and have been playing with them
some.

Nslookup works fine when it is forced to use the -I option when flexing
command.l.

However, I cannot get ping to compile.  It complains about a missing
include file "netinet/ip_vars.h" and then cannot find definitions for
the structure "icmp".    Prowling in some other available sources, it
does seem that the <linux/icmp.h> file is, indeed, missing the definition
of the "struct icmp", and I can't find anyplace in the Linux source trees
that I can scan where "icmp_type" ( a member of struct icmp ) is defined.

Comments?  Pointers, FAQ's to read?  (quick scan of NET-2 HowTo doesn't
seem
to answer the question.)

Can't confirm it as I don't have telnetd running on my system (the only
reason I have TCP configured in my kernel is so I can use X and XTrek).

However, this problem sounds like a problem in whatever version of /bin/login
telnetd is running.  If your version of telnetd gets the username itself
(which would be a silly thing to do if /bin/login is available), then it is
a bug in telnetd.

I did confirm on my system that /bin/login gives the behavior that you
describe, while getty does not.  Since telnetd isn't likely to run getty,
you'll see whatever bugs exist in /bin/login.

Try running /bin/login from your shell directly to verify if this is the
case.

Subject: My first kernel dump with 1.0 :(
Date: Thu, 17 Mar 1994 04:24:55 GMT

I successfully compiled the pre-1.0 kernel and used it moderately harshly for a 
day before discovering that 1.0 had just been released.  So I tried to build on 
one success with another.  Unfortunately shortly after logging in under my      
fresh 1.0 kernel before I could even execute a command I was greeted by         
something like what's below.  So I thought it was my fault (I was eating and    
not monitoring the the build), so I recompiled.  This time the error didn't     
come immediately after displaying the login prompt but waited until I thought   
all was well.  Then just as I began typing a command this came up:

Well, at least cut&paste with selection works.  In fact most things work, but   
intermittently the kernel reminds me that all is not perfect with another       
similar dump.

Well, I decided to see how stable 1.0 is.  The above happened right after       
logging in both time.  So I've been up for 1 hr. 34 min. and it hasn't

"You should really research these issues before posting" as well.
The first guy is right.

The H-R RFC's do not say how 127 should be made special, only that it
should be.  Standards, including RFC's, specify external behavior, not
internal implementation.

You need a pretty dim view of your customers' intelligence and good sense
to put special checks against non-compliant configurations of net 127 in
what is in most systems the performance critical path.  (Route look-up is
particularly important for the performance of un-connect(2)'ed UDP
sockets).  Unless the customer does something wierd to the system, the
normal routing mechanisms do exactly the right things.  There is no excuse
to waste cycles checking for something that few sane customers would
change, and that practically all insane customers are too ignorant to be
able to break.  If the customer overrides those mechanisms, and makes the
system non-compliant with any or all RFC's, do you think the Network Police
will come and break someone's knee-caps?  Who is to say that the customer
does not have good and sufficent reasons for using some network other than
127 for loopback?

To those who may think that this is another sign of buggyness
of Linux: SunOS has the reverse problem (in 4.1.1 at least)
getty gags on > 8 characters, while telnetd accepts them.
Encountered this when trying to set up an UUCP account.

OK, so, when do we get started? :-)  Seriously, thought, how hard would
a RT scheduling class be to implement?  (Actually, I guess SVR4 has 3
classes: RT, system, and TS.  What's the difference between 'system' and
the other two?).  How difficult would it be to write a bounded latency 
real time scheduler, like Solaris 2 has?  There are probably a lot of
problems that I haven't even considered, but I assume many parts of the
kernel would need to be rewritten.(?)  Would every I/O call need to be
asynchronous for this to work?

Have I gone off the deep end to even ask these questions?  I doubt that
many of us need a RTOS, but it would be neat anyway...

No.  127.* is a special network.  It was born special.  IP
implementations should ***ALWAYS*** ignore everything they get from
this address if it comes in over the wire and should ***NEVER*** send
packets to this address out over the wire.  And it should do this be
default.  Robust implementations should enforce this compeletely and
leave no room for the user to configure this.  127.* ARP requests as
well should never be on the wire, and completely ignored if they are
seen by a host on the wire.  ICMP messages should likewise be treated.

To do otherwise is broken and will cause problems.  Think about the
network meltdown that would happen if everybody responded to an ARP
for 127.*....

Yes, SunOS 4.x is broken, in that it doesn't do all these things.
