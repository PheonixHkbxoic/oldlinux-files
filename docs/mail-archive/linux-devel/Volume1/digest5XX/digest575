Perhaps a /proc device with one entry per IRQ, 16 counters in the

Reply-To: Martin.Ludwig@ruba.rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de
Date: Thu, 24 Mar 1994 00:22:12 GMT


Hello Linux-World!

Today I got the following problem and it seems to be a bug in the
TCP and the UDP layer:

After starting an closing e.g. port 21 for 7 times, no TCP-daemon will
answer to a connection at the 8th time. (The problem seems to occur
with any port: I tried the telnet-port, ftp-port, nntp, netstat-port,
finger...(with some ports the TCP-layer dies after the 8th time)).

In detail: the appropriate daemon 
is still started by inetd and I can see a "ESTABLISHED" connection
with netstat, but the daemon dosn't say anything! If I interrupt such
a connections, the daemon doesn't end and the connection becomes the
status FIN_WAIT1 and CLOSE_WAIT in netstat. I couldn't use an TCP-port
to my machine after the 7 times without rebooting! 

With UDP-Port 69 (tftpd): the same behaviour but the udp-connection isn't
shown with netstat!

I tried out to find the problem at an other box running 0.99.14 and
there all was OK. I think there was a big change in the network-code
between 0.99.14 and 0.99.15?

I use V 1.0, the problem occures with 0.99.15, too. 

Can anyone help?

What kernel version are you using and what network version are you using.
the memory_leak problem was fixed in one of the 0.99.15 patches. And the
getting files bigger then 30K was also solved some time ago. Sorry to say
so, but it looks like you are asking about problems that are already solved

Date: 23 Mar 94 22:53:19
Reply-To: bill@goshawk.lanl.gov

The following patch to /etc/magic will cause /usr/bin/file to print
out the command name that dumped core. I find this very useful for
identifying those stray core files that pop up now and then. Here's an
example of how it works:

$ less /etc/password
Quit (core dumped)
$ ls
total 61
  61 core
$ file core
core: core file (Linux)  core dump of less

this solves the problem that people had with kernel versions that
dumped core files with the name of the command spliced to their end,
e.g.  ``core.less'' (hence the crosspost to the c.o.l.d :-).

I set up for the internal cache ( I have no external cache ) but had to
disable it because teh cpu kept interrupting my mathco and gave me stack

Speculations about how to circumvent the GPL should go
to gnu.misc.discuss only.  Followup-To: is set.

The GPL says:
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.

I think this explicitly forbids your proposal, and rightly so, because
what you propose is the same as an .o file - I can trivially
convert the .o file to an .s file that will recreate the .o after assembly,
so the two forms are the same.

IMO binary-only driver distributions would clearly violate the GPL,
and it is up to Linus to allow them explicitly. I also think it would
be a Good Thing to do that.

Watch out here.  Transputers do not have a memory manager, and their
whole raison d'etre (as we say in England) is to support CSP-based
programming as embodied in the Occam programming language.  If you
want to use the (very efficient) task scheduling hardware provided
by a Transputer chip, you will have to use links for comms (not shared
memory) or else get your hands very dirty indeed hacking around at the
lowest level.  Also since there is no memory management, stopping
one process corrupting another is next to impossible.  Unless you impose
a one-prcessor, one-process limit.

Transputers aren't really meant for this sort of thing -- they are
good for embedded systems and highly parallel machines, but not really
for complex OSs.  Unless you have T9000s (rumoured to exist, years overdue,
never seen one myself).  You may be better off implementing the iserver
in a more efficient way.  Transputers are also very slow, compared with
486s, 68040s etc. (again, excepting T9000s).

But don't let me stop you being creative!

Nick.

Is this what you are looking for? This is the README from

This is a device-driver for using transputers in a linux-box via an 
inmos B004-compatible link-interface (most link-interfaces should
support this mode because it works via simple io-instructions)
The package also contains a patch to run the iserver on a linux machine.

Subject: Interrupts??
Date: Thu, 24 Mar 1994 12:25:49 GMT

Probably a confusing subject, but let me explain the problem: 
I have a notebook, which starts beeping and flashing (a led) whenever
the batteries are low. This didn't work under Linux, so I started to
disassemble the BIOS. I'm rather convinced that everything happens
in the DOS interrupt 8 which does the following

        jump to the int 8 location
        [...]
        read a certain port number and put the result in AL
        according to the value of AL beep/flash or do nothing
        [...]
        iret

My question is: how can I implement this behaviour in Linux?
(or better: does there exists a skeleton for implementing this?)

Thanks

Well, I want to encourage you to do it.  It will stop all these
people, who say: "But linux does not run on a multiprocessor", if
it runs on your plug in transputer :-)

My idea was to do as minimal work as possible in the beginning.  Is
it possible, that a process on the transputer sends a signal to the
Intel chip?  Furthermore, is it possible to map transputer memory
into the Intel address space?  In that case, all the system calls
could be processed by the standard Linux kernel, and all you had to
programme was a small transputer kernel, which transfers the system
calls to the Intel.

Not much of the Linux kernel is written in assembler, check with
the header files in /usr/include/asm.  Non-assembler versions of
the string routines as found in /usr/include/linux/strings.h are
found in the GNU C-Library for example.

But you may have to learn about your Transputer's assembly to get
things rolling.
