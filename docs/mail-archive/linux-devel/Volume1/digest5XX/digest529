I read it, and I agree with you.  Don't listen to these net.laywers,
you've got it right.  The code that is downloaded to the card could
just as easily be ROM.  There's no reason that you'd have to disclose
your code.  Heck, you could even compile it with a compiler other than
GCC and just write a intel hex (or motorolla srecord) file to asm
.byte converter.  I would think that's probably what I'd do if I was
doing what you're doing.  That would be the easiest way I can think of
to do it.

Hey, I guess that means you could GPL the code, eh?  After all, it
would just be an assembly file with a bunch of .byte statements in it
:-)  It wouldn't even make it any easier to reverse engineer the code.

By the way, your product sounds great, E-Mail me with the cost.  I'll
be more than happy to help with the code and/or testing.

Yeah, right. I tested the program under Sparc and the program guesses
the Sparc is using an AMD chip ;-) because the test fails.

I do believe that the code itself is much more problematic.

The program told me that the Sun I'm working on also contains an AMD486DX
chip.  Somehow, I doubt that :^)

 >I do believe that the code itself is much more problematic.

No, that conclusion is _way_ too hasty.  The problematic part is the test
for precise equality, where a LSB rounding error should be considered
acceptable (Golden Rule: Never Test Floats For Exact Equality).  For
example, the Sun's output

 1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499868
 1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499869
 Test Failed, this must be an AMD 486DX chip!

is entirely acceptable (difference one LSD: 0.000001), but the AMD output
as posted in an earlier article

 1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499990
 1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499869
 Test Failed, this must be an AMD 486DX chip!

is fatally out of spec (difference 0.000121) and signifies a _very_ bad
and _real_ bug.

I've appended a more sensible (if still rough) version of the test at
the end of this article.  Please compile this and run it on your computer
(be it Intel, AMD or Cyrix).

Reply-To: hank@automat.uni-essen.de


Hi!

So on my last posting I got some ideas on how the VESA support for
monitor power saving works. Switch either hsync or vsync off and the
thing goes into suspend mode (which will switch the monitor into power
save mode after a certain time), switch both syncs off and the beast
goes into power save at once. (Of course this needs a VESA conforming
monitor with this capability, usually something with a digital
control).

NOW: I don't have any real documentation on the S3 card (that's the
one I have at home) or the ET4000 (that's the ones I have at work,
which doesn't interest me too much :-). Is there anybody out there
with good infos on what to do do which registers to switch the syncs
on and off? It should be pretty easy than to put this code into the
kernel's console.c to use this feature under linux.

Thanks for any info!

                  Hank

This is the reason why some monitors don't go blank if the sync is
missing, but light the whole screen half-bright instead. That is a
good feature to detect cable or plug problems, or a computer that is
turned off with the monitor still running.

They make an extension board with a CPU on it and develop code to run
on that CPU. That code is proprietary. Someone who wants that
extension supported under Linux writes a Linux driver that can upload
the proprietary code to the extension. The uploader program becomes
part of the kernel and is GPLed, while the actual upload code -
provided as a separate binary file, and not dependent on hardware or
OS types - remains proprietary. Also GPLed is the part of the kernel
device driver that does operational data transfers to the card based
on a published interface.

What the hell should be wrong with that?

Suppose I have an EPROM burner with software that is GPLed. I use this
burner, driven by GPL software, to load the latest update of ZyXEL
modem operation software gotten from their FTP server onto two chips
which I insert in the modem to operate with the stock Linux 16550
driver (GPLed).  Now the chips obviously still carry proprietary and
copyrighted software. What should be wrong with this? Should someone
complain about ZyXEL in that case (for which reason)?

NOT!!  This "corrected" test program compares a result computed at
float precision with one computed at double precision, at double
precision!!  It fails on my Intel 486DX/33, whereas the original one

You may be right, but the test was not really to test for equality.
The test was thrown in as an after thought.  I certainly did not mean
to have the program run on anything other that 486's.  The purpose of
program was simply to multiply two numbers and show that my amd486 did
not compute the correct value for the float calculation.

IE. the output:

1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499990
1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499869

is really what concerns me.  1.312500 * 7.999900 does not equal 10.499990
no matter what kind of rounding rules you may use.  The rest of the
program and output is irrelevant. If boot my system with the no387 option
or recompile the program with the msoft-float option, the program 
gives a more accurate result.

Greg.

Last year there was a post about the (then) current driver
not working with the new ROM (which permits more than one meg
disks to be used). A friend at work tried to install
Slackware 1.1.2 (gotten from ftp.cdrom.com on Feb. 20) and
got the following:
   configuring adaptec @ io: 330, irq 11, dma priority 5
   aha1542_out failed (1): aha1542.c: interrupt received, but no mail.
   aha1542.c: interrupt received but no mail.
   scsi0 : adaptec 1542
   scai  : 1 hosts
   aha1542.c: interrupt received, but no mail.

And, of course couldn't load. He's removed all adapters
from his system except a TSENG video card, his adaptec 1542C
SCSI card, a serial card and the memory. His system is
a 486DX/33. Is there a new version of the adaptec SCSI driver
for Linux that supports the greater than one meg ROM?

Thanks for information.

The Linux kernel (0.99.13) has problems with the hard drive in my new computer.
Here's what it prints out when it boots:

hd.c: ST-506 interface disk with more than 16 heads detected,
  probably due to non-standard sector translation. Giving up.
  (disk 0: cyl=524, sect=63, head=32)
Partition check:

The docs that came with the computer (it's a Gateway 2000 P5-66) tell me the
hard drive looks like:  cyl=1048, head=16, and sect=63.

Can I fix my hard drive problem by telling the kernel what type of hard drive
I actually have?  I changed the file /usr/src/linux/kernel/blk_drv/hd.c to
look like:

...

        i = NR_HD;
        while (i-- > 0) {
                hd[i<<6].nr_sects = 0;

This change has stopped the kernel from complaining on boot-up and has let me
mount my hard drive.  My questions are:  Is this fix safe?  Will it cause other
problems for me later on?  Will I be able to read and write my whole hard
drive?


Thanks,
