In that case, I suggest you write your prototypes with __P macros (see

Since you have to do something when you get a completely bogus event the cost
is pretty minimal. If you've worked with 386BSD or commercial kernels of
almost any kind you'll find them full of sanity checks. Some of the realtime
ones tend to just output things like 'OOPS 337 1EFA 226B:441C' and you look
them up in a book but they are still there.

There are a combination of at least 4 small problems in the tcp closedown

problems 2 and 3 although I'm still playing with them (Thanks Gerhard) and
number 4 I haven't traced down yet.

A number of people have criticised this, saying that
1. newsreaders have a tendency not to pay any attention to Keywords and
2. some posters may have technical problems inserting such headers.

I've therefore been convinced to go for Subject line tags instead, as
are used in several newsgroups.  They often look like this:
  Subject: [keyword] rest of subject line
I'll be happy to see or receive comments on the exact format.

I'm guessing that you haven't used checker yet.  First off the doc says
that you should have libc 4.5.19 not 21, I don't know if it will make
a difference.  Then you must replace as and ld with the checker versions.
(the original upload to nic.funet.fi did not have 'em, try now or from
Sunsite).  In my Slackware 1.1.2 system I just make the symlinks
that used to be as and ld point to the checker version of the above.

It works quite well although I wish that it would work with C++ and iostream.

Let me add a request for inclussion in the FAQ of any information
about an API for Windows under Linux. Is one being planned? Will
it support Win16 and Win32? Am I totally missing the point here? 8^)
What I need to know is whether I'll be able to develop for
Windows using a Linux box. Maybe a cross compiler would do the trick;
OTOH maybe I'll be able to run Borland C++ on top of wine. 

So many questions, so little info...

What standard specifies select should write to the timeval?  SunOS 4.1
is the only system I've seen where it's even mentioned as a possible
future enhancement.  I certainly agree it's a useful enhancement, but it
is incompatible with a great number of previous implementations.  This
is a serious source of bugs for the unwary porting interactive network

Sounds like you do something in the line of L.A.D.R (Linux
Advanced Desktop Release) which is the followup to the simple
UMSDOS installation kit. Maybe we may split the job. I am
currently doing experience with the andrew multimedia system.
I hope to provide some sort of embeded help/administration system.
My goal is to cleanup all(most) rough edges in linux. Many are
show stopper for newbie and some experience users. These include
at least:

        swap
        user admin
        printers
        Networking
        Mail
        

In fact, I don't expect to make everything simple, but certainly enough
so a newbie will be able to make some use of linux (and be impressed).

The address was assigned back in the days when the interet was but a
few hundred hosts and nobody thought that it would ever be large
enough to make assigning a large block of addresses a problem.  Now
they are redesigning IP to handle more than 4 billion hosts[*]...

I normally boot from my dos partition (/dev/hda1) and I'd like to have 
the option to not always use a boot floppy. I found the lilo directory on 
(/dev/hda2) which is my linux partition, however I don't really know what 
to do with it .... Apparently when I asked linux to boot using lilo it 
didn't touch my c drive or (dev/hda1). I was wondering how I go about

IRIX 5.0 also mentions in its man pages that this is a possible future
enhancement.  However, I have ported one thing which did spin because
it relied on the timeout value not changing.

I know of at least two commercial versions of IP that have had bug
fixes applied to them that stop them from spitting out 127.* to the
wire.  I'm not aware of anything that supplants this requirement in
RFC 1122.

Any system that does spits 127.* to the wire is broken.

I am having a problem with a socket connection to localhost with TCP/IP.

The Linux system that I am using is patchlevel 14, and all the network
services appear to function.. (telnet, ftp, nfs mount...) When I try to do
TCP socket connects, I get an IMMEDIATE error return from the source code
below. In the source code  below, I am simply trying to connect to localhost.

if ( connect(*piSocket, &stSocketIn, sizeof(stSocketIn)) < 0 )
        return TCP_CONNECT_ERROR;       /* error in errno */
        return 0;

Are there any setup issues with TCP that I should be aware of? Note that the
source that I have will execute properly on a Solaris/SunOS, Unixware, SCO, 
HPUX or AIX box, so this has been a bit puzzling.

Any Ideas? I wanted to try this first before wasting lots of bandwidth posting
source.
