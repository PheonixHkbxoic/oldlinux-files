A week ago I saw an article asking about multiple entrys in the listed 
routing table..  I just upgraded to libc2.4.21, and pl15.  Now I also
get this "problem".  Although it does not apear to have any ill sideeffects.

but..

The binary version of "routed" does not work anymore.  When I run a strace on 
it, it appears to fail on the "sendto:" system call;
 Sendto: Invalid arguement

So, if this is answered somewhere, just point me in the right direction.

You gotta get the list of symbols from _somewhere_. Since it doesn't make
sense to list all kernel symbols in the kernel itself (too big) and you
shouldn't depend on an external file like /vmlinuz (compressed, you don't
know that that's the kernel that got loaded), you need a small list of
exported symbold compiled into the kernel.

If you switch to real mode, you'll kill Linux, plain and simple.
Real mode uses a different interrupt vector scheme, so all the
Linux interrupt and trap handlers will be useless.  I didn't see
the original post, but if you really want to go into real
mode -- and keep in mind that it's a one-way trip until a reboot --
you can call iopl with an argument of 3.  This lets outer ring
programs use I/O services.  Your program must be running as root
to do this.

You will then want to set up low memory (0-640k PHYSICAL memory)
for the transition to real mode.  The easiest way to do this is
to mmap() 4k-640k to somewhere in your memory (I believe that
the zero page is not available from Linux).  You'll need access
to the zero page, however (PHYSICAL addresses 0-4095), as
you'll need to set up some interrupt handlers.  I believe that
Linux leaves the bootup interrupt vectors alone, so you can
probably skip this, but if not, you'll need to modify the
zero page.  You can find the address of the page directory from
the CR3 register (you'll have to use inline assembly to get this).
You will then find some unused page in one of the page tables
and map the zero page there R/W.  Set up any interrupt handlers
you need to, insert whatever real-mode code you plan on running at
the proper address within your mmap()ed /dev/mem space, twiddle the
magic bits in CR0 (PE and PG) and you're in real mode.  Note that
the except sequence you should execute to change PE and PG is
a bit complicated.  For example, once you change PE, you'll be running
at the physical equivalent of whataver linear address is in the PC, 
so it's a bit tricky.  Also, I don't kno if you get one instruction
(i.e. a jmp) before the PG change takes effect, or if you immediately
drop into real mode. 

And that's just a skeleton.  Now, are you absolutely *sure* vm86
mode won't do twhat you want?  It's much easier.

Pardon the short lines, but I'm working on a 100 column screen and
am not quite sure where the 80 column mark is.

I have to be careful here as I'm working with a real PC isdn card. I'm still

Linux has few 'special' requirements. In general DMA is a nuisance and for
small transfers on the PC a total loser. Linux does need interrupts because
unlike DOS it can't afford to poll all the time.

No technical reason, but a logistical one:  the GNU utilities don't handle ELF
fully yet, so we'd be left without a linker and maybe an assembler.

Yes. It's a bug in refill_freelist; it doesn't check whether enough buffers
already are on the list. Since refill_freelist is called from read_block
unconditionally, this results in a slowdown or a hangup.

The fix is rather simple.

I thought that the folks at Cygnus were working on this.  Wasn't there
the implication in the last release of gld that ELF would be readly RSN,
or was that just a wishfull dream on my part?  I thought gas allready 
supported ELF sort of.

Right now this seems to be what everyone is holding their breath for
(Linux, FreeBSD, BSDI BSD/386).  I think that a working ELF gld would
also allow a completely free development system (libs and all) for 
Unixware and friends, no?  

Eric, you mention that finishing ELF for gld would be a daunting task
(which terrifies me, since there seems to be no limit to Eric's talents
at writing Linux kernel code).  What exactly needs to be done to gld and
the GNU BFD to get this working?  I thought that BFD was invented exactly
to make such a job "easy" (obviously not :-).

This problem will probably solve itself. As more people write modules, 
Linus will get a better idea what symbols need to be made available to
modules. I don't think it will take that long for the list of symbols
to become pretty complete.

Hi,
we're currently using a DOS router (KA9Q/PCROUTE/PAPI) to communicate
to the outside TCP/IP world and it works great.
However, since BSD386 began supporting ISDN drivers since Version 1.0,
I wonder whether this has already been done for Linux.
I remember there was some noise about this item months ago, so if 
someone could mail me the current status of this project or give me
some hints on the appropriate mailing list ?

Hi,
I just installed 0.99p15 on top of SLS 1.04 (yes, I know the libs are quite old
and lilo doesn't cooperate with AMI BIOS/DOS in this version).

To my great surprise I found that there finally was support for the COFF a.out
included in the kernel, but the iABI to the system calls was not supported yet.
I tried to start some programs ftped from an SCO machine nearby and all
I got was "iSBC not supported yet" or some message like this.

Is there already a beta (or even alpha) version of iABI available ?
I didn't find anything in the ftp archives about it (not even docu),
so could someone please inform me about the status of the iABI / COFF
project ? 

Please mail me, I don't want to waste too much bandwidth in this group as it's
already big enough.

Bernd

P.S. I'm quite willing to spend some time testing iABI; however I can't 
promise I'll find the time to add any codes or bug fixes.
