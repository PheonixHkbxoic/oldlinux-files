Well if you create the directory structure before you ftp the following:

ftp>mget */*

from the top level directory should copy everything but the bootdisks
directories. However the target directories have to already be in place.

Might be a good idea if a shell script with the directory structure
were posted with the distribution.

I'm running an IIT 387 with a TI486DLC and haven't experienced any problems 
at all.  (Actual mileage may vary)

I had to mess with the kernel build to get it to work too...   But I just 
applied the .alt diffs instead of ripping out the video drivers.

I did what you did plus change the packet's length back to little endian.
The Linux side accepts ping from Dos and tries to answer.
The first byte is transferred, followed by the multiple error :
"remote end become unready while sending\n".
Maybe we can find the asm-source for plip.com or Russ can hear us!

On sunsite, and others running your better ftp software, all you need to do
is change to the directory with the top of the slackware/ tree, and issue a
'get slackware.tar'.  It tars up the directory and ships you a
'slackware.tar' like you'd expect.

It could fairly well be that you are using a wrong (?) co-pro.
I have found that the TI486DLC has problems with for instance
the IIT co-pro. It works fine with the Cyrix 387 though.
I've a DLC with an Cyrix now and it works great.
The only problem I had was that the setup module became larger
then 512 bytes, so I had to rip out most videocard tests.
Goodluck,
Martijn.

Why not put it in the kernel? It seems like a logical place for it. It seems 
like a lot of work have to coordinate the kernel with a user process, and 
could slow down the console driver due to context switching overhead, etc. 
The vt100 emulation is in the kernel already, this wouldn't be much different.

Someone has already done the reverse-engineering.  In Dr. Dobbs Journal a 
few months back, the NCP (Netware Core Protocol) was documented.  The NCP 
is how the Shell(Netx) communicates with the server, on top of IPX.  
There is also a book that is being released about Netware that covers 
many of the undocumented aspects.

With this information and an IPX layer, basic shell functionality can be 
written, like attaching to servers and printing.  However this would only 
work for servers that didn't encrypt the passwords, and did not have the 
newer security features installed.

Er, what?  Linux isn't like DOS, and those aren't special reserved names.  Those
are links created when you make the directory: "." is a link to the directory
containing it, and ".." is a link to the parent directory, unless you're in /

Subject: Patch for T130B with interupts
Date: 24 Mar 1994 02:50:25 GMT


OK, here is a tar.gz file containing 2 new files (g_C400.[ch]) and patches
to the NCR5380 scsi code and a few files up the source tree to config.in.
These patches will allow you to configure in an NCR53C400 generic scsi
driver which is (at the moment) just the same as the NCR5380 driver with
one extra write to turn on T130B interupts and a whole lot of other stuff
which will make the next stage (PSEUDO_DMA) easier.

Note that previously, you had to add 8 to your port address to get the
NCR5380 driver to work with a T130B. Now the 53C400 driver does this for
you so you should configure it in at the port address jumpered on the card.

The patches below include a patch to Makefile that sets an overide for the
default address of 0x350 which you're welcome to use, remove or change as
you require. The driver can be configured for mthe lilo prompt in the same
way as the ncr5380 driver, expcept you use ncr53c400=.... instead.
(Although if you have the override in the Makefile, you don't need this).

I'm hoping this patch is complete. I know that the patches in the NCR5380.*
files and the new g_C400.* files are but I have had to refix the files
further up (eg hosts.c and main.c and config.in) without access to a Linux
box (my modem link went down and I had forgotten to grab those files). I'm
almost certain I got everything, but let me know if you have troubles
compiling this.

The performance of this code is still poor, given that there is no DMA
happening but it is better than the generic 5380 driver with no interupts.
I'm working on the PSEUDO_DMA code at the moment but time is scarce.

Here comes the tar.gz file uuencoded. It contains g_C400.h and g_C400.c
which you should copy into /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi and a patch file
which you can apply from /usr/src/linux using: patch -p1 < c400.patch

cd to ftp.cdrom.com:pub/linux and do a "get slackware.tar".
The resulting file is 75 meg...

You can get all files by mget *  but you need to create your own
directory at your site first.

We are forced to use an existing DOS application that needs direct
I/O-memory access. Is it possible to run such a program from within
the Linux DOS-emulation and if so, how?

Look on sunsite.unc.edu, and tsx in the directories where GCC is located.

You'll find a program that which does what you want it to.

I've tried three times so far to do this, and the connection keeps getting
reset - once after getting 32Mb!.  So now I'm getting a directory at a time.
