It is a common problem, 127.0.0.2 can be even more dangerous, quite a few
machines only have 127.0.0.1 rather than 127.0.0.0 as a route to loopback.
Thus such an address can end up going through serveral machines, simply
being forwarded to default routes until it gets to a machine which accepts
it. In some instances telnet 127.0.0.2 will connect you to a (psudo-random)
machine somewhere on the internet.

Subject: NCR 53c700 drivers available?
Date: 10 Mar 1994 18:16:38 GMT

Hello!

Is there a driver for scsi cards with NCR 53C700-66 available
or is someone working on one? 

Cards with this chip (e.g. TMC SP-382 or Forex FR600AF) seem 
to be really fast and pretty cheap (at least VLB version).

Is the NCR 53C700 similar to the 53C810 for PCI bus?
Will the same drivers work for both?

Please excuse that many questions, but I'm looking for
a fast and cheap VLB scsi adapter. That seems to difficult
because some are fast but not cheap (e.g. Ultrastor 34F) 
and others are cheap but only fast enough for CD-ROMS.

I hope someone could help

This is the second example I have spotted of someone doing this....

: Yes. Read the documentation. You're reusing your timeout values.
: The first time you call select(), it zeroes the variable because no more

I thought it actually set the value to the time remaining of the original
timout. Thus it zeros if the select ends due to a timeount. But it may
not end up as zero if it is due to any fd's being ready.

: time is remaining. The next time you're calling select(), the variable is
: still zero.

It could be that you will get unpridictable behaviour on timeout, before
getting to the state of no timout.

: This is mentioned in both the SunOS and Linux manpages for select().

What happens is that quite a few versions of select(), including on Suns,
never write to the timeout. So what is actually broken code runs ok on
them.

Date: 12 Mar 1994 12:23:17 -0500

[I'm cc'ing this to support at ACCTON. So to explain a bit
of background, I'm trying to use an EtherPocket for Linux,
a free UNIX clone for the i386+ architecture. This post
is going out on the Linux development newsgroup.]

I've recently purchased a EtherPocket 10baseT adaptor for a new
notebook. There doesn't seem to be any driver written for this
so far.. Anyone else got this out there?
(model=EN2201.. "manual" (hehe :) gives this "technical
information" : irq 5, 7; 8k buffer, 256-bit eprom)
Oh well. ACCTON does include a packet driver for DOS
as well as NDIS, ODI, and IPX stuff..

if I need to write a driver for this, where should I start?
I am amazingly bad at coding :) would appreciate any pointers..
I can't find any Crynwr drivers .. just a *very* obscure
1 line statement in a PCNFS readme file:
"When asked to identify the type of network interface card
you are using, select "WD8003" [with IRQ 3 and IO 0x300]"
I tried that with the Linux wd.c, but understandably got nothing.
(I guess that refers to the emulation the PCNFS driver uses) 

Oh well. Any easy way out? I can send the packet driver
to any interested skilled victims/experts out there :)

OK, GPL question. The packet driver is based on
"Packet driver skeleton copyright 1988-90, Russell Nelson."
with the standard GPL disclaimer. I'm not sure if
GPL says that the source code should be available
from ACCTON ("Portions Copyright 1990-1992, ACCTON CO.,LTD.")

You'd be wrong if that what's you thought.

But Peter, you've made your code so clean it is no longer compatible with
the largest base of systems supporting those functions -- SVR4 boxes.

What has made Shadow so popular (at least it was popular enough to be
stuffed into Linux ...) is that Shadow on one system is just like
Shadow every where else.  On my old SCO Xenix box I could say "group
foo" and get a complete list of the groups "foo" belonged to.  Even
though Xenix doesn't support concurrent groups.  When you start saying
"I know better -- I'm going to do it right" you confront the very
real possibility that

        1). You don't know better.
        2). Fewer people will use it because they can't afford to
            be incompatible with whatever else they must use.

Why would I write anything for Linux that requires the use of getspnam()
if I can't trust it to return "NULL" when there is no entry in /etc/shadow?
If you'd follow the SVR4 semantics at least an application which cares
can PORTABLY determine the existence of shadowed entries.

>Btw, what's stopping you from writing your own NYS library with your
>shadow stuff if you think my stuff is so bogus, wrong and totally useless?

Given that your code is under the GPL this is a very real possibility.
This is also one of the reasons I've never (and never will) place all
of Shadow under the GPL.  And I did get the note about the GDBM hooks
being added.  Putting NDBM support into NYS is a pretty likely occurance.
Why limit myself to GDBM when NDBM is more widely available (given that
every system which supports GDBM also supports NDBM).

Ah, the old assumption about just being able to login as root
and make everything OK.

What do you do when this happens and the only person with the
root password is in Nebraska and you're in another state?

RELIABILITY is something to be designed in.  YP is a good way
to start designing it out.  Complexity and reliability are
opposites.

This may be a silly question, but when it is done, should it run
most Windows programs, or only those that run in standard mode?  I
assume it could never run programs like Windows Mathematica, correct, 
because it fiddles with the processor mode?  Of course, if it goes 
through the Win API or DMPI it has a chance, I guess?

Subject: Changes in TCP retry code?
Date: 12 Mar 1994 18:16:28 GMT

    I'm using the pre-1.0 release version of the kernel that I patched up
incrementally over time from 0.99pl15.  Somewhere about 15h or so I noticed
some momentary freezes when using a TCP connection to a site far away (18 
hops).  The strange thing is that the freezes are only of outgoing packets,
never incoming packets.  So I still can get output until my packet gets 
retried.  'netstat -c' shows my command is still trying to go out.  Even
closes of the socket don't appear to work normally.  They *do* finish, but
it usually takes a couple minutes to do so.  I haven't seen any problems
locally which is why I suspect a retry problem.  I'm going to try backing up
until I find a version that works.

It crashed as I run it as user "guest" on my AMD386dx33 with 0.99pl15h. 
I guess I will make a password to that account :-)
The machine stopped completely, no reaction to the "three-finger-salute".

Reply-To: romano@iet.unipi.it

Hi all,

   I have a little problem that showed up in the long upgrading run 
from pl15 to pre1-0 (sorry I don't remember when). The problem shows up 
with ftp (I know, I know, this is not the right group for a ftp bug report,
but wait...). While transferring, frequently pop-up the message "cannot open
data connection" and I have to retry it. The problem is that, after, 
netstat -t  shows:

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address        (State)
...
tcp        1      0 sensores2.fis.ucm:1074 phoenix.doc.i:ftp-data CLOSE  
tcp        1      0 sensores2.fis.ucm:1309 arcfos1.arclc:ftp-data CLOSE  
...

and _no_ in.ftpd daemons or similars still run. Note that this CLOSEing are 
eternal, probably because there is something in the receiving queue. Now, 
shouldn't the kernel take care cleaning up this things if the processer
(mis)using them die? In the (very) long run this could lead to problems to 
the network (or I am missing something important).

BTW, there is a way of cleaning up this w/o reboot or ifconfig eth0 down and 
starting again all the network daemons?

Thank you,
                Romano.

Date: 10 Mar 1994 14:13:22 GMT

The command "tcpspray -e -n 10000 localhost" hangs up the pl15j and 
pre-1.0 Linux kernel. The tcpspray receiver process stops with a
segmentation fault and the shell prompt returns but the system hangs
up (no error message, no kernel panic, no VC switching, no reaction 
on Ctrl+Alt+Del, only Ctrl+Scroll-Lock and Shift+Scroll-Lock are still 
working but without writing to syslog).

With pl15i and older (I have tested pl15, pl15a, pl15b, pl15d, pl15f,
pl15h and pl15i) this doesn't happen ! But tcpspray stops with 
segmentation fault, too. Gdb says, that the fault happens inside 
read on the receiver socket. Calls with less blocks (without "-n 10000")
works normaly fine. Only sometimes they stops with a segmentation fault,
too.

I used tcpspray.1.1a.tar.z from sunsite (‾linux/system/Network) without
any modifications.

I recently bought an ACCTON EtherPocket parallel 10BaseT adaptor

I can't find anything helpful on the disk that's included
except for a packet driver I can use for DOS - interestingly
the skeleton is based on the GPL:
"Packet driver skeleton copyright 1988-90, Russell Nelson."
"This program is free software; see the file COPYING for details." (etc)
Does the GPL says that ACCTON should offer/release the source code?
