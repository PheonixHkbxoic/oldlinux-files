I've had the *exact* same problem, partial file transfers then timeouts,
but not just with WinSock clients...  my experience includes the DOS packet 
drivers (v11c) using PCGopher from boombox.micro.umn.edu.  I've also used 
NetManage's WinSock and Gopher client, and Mosaic with Trumpet WinSock and 
had the same trouble.  These two clients can hit on servers all over the net, 
except mine... I'm running GN under Linux (both pl14 and pl15).  I've tried 
gopherd, too, and had the same problem.  Other Unix clients (from a Sun 
workstation) can hit just fine, but they appear to pause a long time during 
transfers.  FTP clients sometimes have the same problem, so it's not just a 
problem with gopher/gn.

I've also tried a one-line change recommended by Donald Becker to fix the 
3c509 driver, but that didn't help.

Please, someone fix this quick or I'll have to setup our gopher server 
on a Sun...  yukkkk!  
Thanks,
-Paul

I have similar problems in a somewhat different setup.  In my scenario, 
the Linux machine is located BETWEEN the PC and the net.  It has an
ethernet connection to the LAN and a SLIP connection to the Internet.  Now,
the Macs and the Linux machine can read news off the NNTP server fine.  But
none of the Windows machine can.  If those machines use Trumpet or WinVN or
QVT's news client, the session just hangs.  They can't get the new group 
list, they can't scan for new articles.  As for the transfer of data
not completing, I have experienced this problem in a particular setup.  I
run Chameleon from NetManage (incidentally, I ran 3.11N and now 4.0, but it
still does not work) on one machine.  That machine cannot FTP anything 
from anywhere.  On the other hand, two machines which use the Microsoft
TCP stack can FTP successfully, but cannot read news.

I get a SEGFAULT on my SVR4 machine with gcc and the system as.  What happens is
that the assembler does a mmap() on the output that gcc generates and somehow
overruns the file size.  I think that the problem is with my disk controller -
a local bus utron 601 IDE (I think) - because if I swap in a normal 16 bit
controller, the problem doesn't occur.  This also hasn't happened since I
removed my second hard drive (and put Linux on it :) ).

I haven't tried the gcc -pipe option, but that may help.

While this was happening I swapped the /usr/ccs/as with the following shell
script:

--

#!/bin/ksh
sleep 1
done=0
while [ $done = "0" ] ; do
   /usr/bin/truss /usr/ccs/bin/as.real $* > /tmp/as.out 2>&1
   as_stat="$( /usr/bin/tail -1 /tmp/as.out )"
   as_pk=$( /sbin/expr "$as_stat" : ".**** \(process killed\) ***")
   if [ "$as_pk" = "process killed" ] ; then
      echo "Trying again: $as_stat"
      done=0
   else
      done=1
   fi
done

--

This worked most of the time when as was SEGFAULTing, but sometimes the system
would lock up and I would have to pull the plug (AHHHHH!!!).

Good Luck,

Chris

No, newer Mac drives spin at a constant rate. That's difficult to find out

You can say it, but that doesn't make it true.  The Amiga has a
coprocessor (blitter) that does the decoding for it.  This not only
takes 0 processor time to decode the tracks, it also allows it to take
0 processor time to do most of the graphics.  The Amiga was a truely
eligant design, I've not seen any other system that even comes close
to it. (sez Jay who is now using a Linux box for the most part)

That reminds me of something that happened a number of years ago.
When the Amiga came out the most impressive demo was called 'boing',
I'm sure most everyone has seen it, it was a rapidly bouncing white
and red ball.  Immediately after the Amiga came out there were a bunch
of demos written for about every machine in existance, also with a big
white and red bouncing ball.  They said 'See computer x can do it
too'. Unfortunately they were entierly missing the point.  The most
impressive part of the boing demo was not that it could bounce a ball
on the screen.  What was impressive was that it only took 8% of the
CPU to do this.  

The fact the Amiga only used 8% to do what the other machines used
100% to do went right over their heads.  This is understandable
because they didn't know what multi-tasking was.  Nine years later, in
this linux crowd, I'm sure the point doesn't go over your heads.

Must be a real problem then, enough of us seem to be seeing it around
the same time now.  

I just saw it for the first time ever under ALPHA-1.0 (Linux).  Persisted until
I rebooted the system, and now I haven't seen it since.  I am running with old
libraries & gcc (Fall-LGX CD), so I just assumed at first that it might be a
bug that has been fixed in newer stuff.  But other posters claim to be using
very recent gcc/libc so now I'm beginning to suspect an instability in 
the kernel.

Subject: Adaptec hanging up if last dvice in chain is powered off
Date: 10 Mar 1994 16:15:47 GMT

Hi there,

today I noticed a problem with my Adaptec controller I didn't find in
other OS-Environments.

If have a Adaptec 1542 controller installed. Internally there is a hard-drive
connected. Externally there is a box with a WangDat Streamer. Works fine if
the external power of the box is on. 

If I unplug it the whole filesystem crashes. As I know SCSI devices must 
terminate the bus (is done !) but I didn't know that all devices must 
be powered on. 

Somebody else with this problem / misbehaviour ? Or is there something 
wrong with my thoughts ?

For reference: I use Alpha 1.0 Kernel.

Volkmar

P.S. The same problem occurs if I try to boot with power off for the external
device.

Does anyone know whether there is some sort of assembly language debugger
for Linux (ie i386/486). I need some way to single step through a couple of 
assmebler routines which I wrote.
It would be nice if the debugger handled C/C++ code as well, but that isn't
crucial.

Thanks in advance,

        Nicely said. But it makes me happy to know that SOMEONE (the man you

consider distributing the driver with the boards themselves? And as part of the

to get our company switched over to Specialix boards exclusively (we used to

supply for SCO.
