Possibly. The Amiga uses a different track layout, but I don't think
it does anything particularly strange. The hardware, when not crippled
by MS-DOS, *ought* to be able to do it.

That's complete nonsense. MS-DOS has no hooks for adding alternate

I didn't suggest that approach, because certain people will then say that

SVR4 networking takes a lot from BSD. Unfortunately they took the worst bits.
Sun also had to get good compatibility with SunOS which was BSD derived.

You make sure you have the right headers and use -Ibsd. Very few
programs need to go into the ip layer in that level of detail

Hello,

I want to realize a program to manage my CD Audio collection.

I have read cdrom.h and partly the code of workman and it's really usefull

Are there other informations available on the CD (Track name, Title,
unique number - UPC?, ...) How to find that information ? How to 
know the interface with ioctl. 

Can anyone point me to some documentation on the subject ? or better
explain me how it works, if you have time -:)

Thanks by advance of any information

We have those every once in a while on our 3c503.  We thought it was
an external network problem.  Slackware Pat wasn't aware of any problems.
You are the first person other than myself with this problem.

We never have to reboot, though.  It just passes.

Maybe I'm working from old or just not the right docs.  If this is 
the case, please point me to the right set.

In the Kernel Hacker's Guide (I think it was 0.5), it's explained
that a user app can hit I/O latches by calling ioperm() (which 
presumably cracks the iopl on those ports open so that the app can
get to them w/o faulting).   I've nm'ed and ar'ed everything I can
find that looks like a library and zgrep'ed throught he man pages.
What library should this be in?   On some other UNIX'es, I can issue
a sysi86() and do this, and on most others, there is an undocumented
way of hitting I/O.

And on inb and outb, I see that the macros (from hell) in <linux/os.h>
are trying to do, but I still get unresolved externals on (I think)
___inp and ___outp (not sure).   I tried the same manner to locate
those functions, and again drew blanks.

What am I missing?

It depends on the use. There are numerous problems with DMA

1.      You take a large cache miss as a result
2.      Setting up a DMA transfer on a PC is quite slow and messy
3.      Using the on board DMA controller is quite slow. Bus mastering DMA
        is fast but no tall motherboards do it right.
4.      On an ISA bus you have to fight the 16Mb DMA ceiling

Basically for anything but large block transfers you are better using I/O
ports.

I guess since its a sort of super serial port you stick them on the serial
IRQ's. Most ISDN cards I've seen do 16 bit irqs

2. Use gcc(1) with the appropriate flags instead, namely
   '-W' with one or several of the -W options, together

Oh, yes, the Amiga definitey does something particularly strange.

The PC floppy controller chip works with sectors, each with a preamble
and header and CRC and trailer.  The only command that doesn't work by
sector is "format track".

The Amiga floppy controller "chip" is a section of the "Paula" custom
chip.  All it does is get raw patters to and from the drive via DMA.
This gives the software a lot of latitude, to come up with creative
new layout schemes.  The Amiga's floppy format uses one big sector per
track, with one preamble at the beginning and one trailer at the end
and 5632 data bytes in between.  The PC floppy chip just can't make
sense of this.

I need some suggestions!

        After adding a SCSI card and Drive to my Linux box the system
        would not boot. I was running 0.99.14, Previously I think
        I had recompiled the kernel with out SCSI support. So instead
        of removing the hardware and then recompiling the kernel I 
        downloaded one of the boot disks that would see the scsi hard-
        ware and not crash. I then proceeded to boot the machine.
                Once it came up, taking more memorey due to loading the
        ram disk. I went into the /usr/src/linux directoy and started to
        config the new kernel. Well all went well with this. Every thing
        did seem a little slow due to the lack of free memory, but
        not to bad. After the make config I started the make dep which 
        took 3.5 hours. With everything as slow as it was after the make
        dep finished I issued the command:

                        make clean ; make zImage

        Well now 49 hours in the recompile I am getting a little upset!
        Started looking around and found cron holding 145% of the memory!!
        This should not happen should it? I have a 4meg system with a 
        20meg swap file. No doubt the reason for the loooonnnng compile
        is due to the lack of memory. Can cron be killed and not hurt
        the Compile? Why is Cron holding so much memory all of the time?
        The system is @ 85% idle but showing all the memory used up and
        a large portion of the swap file.  Any suggestions ?

        Need help quick!

                Thanks Brian!

        Please disregard spelling and other errors, I had to compose this
        on a hardcopy terminal.

Yes, there is. It's on tsx-11, in the BETA directory. I'm using it since
about 3 months now and am very content. It is indeed faster than
in Adaptec mode.
