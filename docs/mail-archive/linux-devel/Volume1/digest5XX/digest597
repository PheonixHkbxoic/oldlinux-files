I installed the first IDE performance patch, and seeing that the default
was to unmask interrupts, I thought that perhaps the problems associated
with unmasking the interrupts had been solved, so I left the setting as is..
Unfortunately, unmasking interrupts caused my disks to be seriously trashed.
And although e2fsck seemed to repair the damage, there were many files I had
to re-install and many others that I had to re-create...  I'm still not 100%
confident that the file system is "back to normal", even though it's been
several weeks now without incident.  I think it's a bad idea for the default
to be unmasked interrupts.  In any patch/package where there is a significant
risk of data loss, all the settings should be such that the it will not cause
problems for the majority of systems, even at the expense of lost performance.
If you want to take a chance, you can enable these risky features, but they
definitely should not be on by default.

Subject: dblspace for umsdos using dosemu
Date: 2 Apr 1994 04:26:44 -0600

To umsdos and dosemu hackers:

I have been using the ALPHA 0.2 umsdos fs version of Slackware 99.15 
and have enjoyed having Linux co-existing my MS-DOS formated HD, without 
re-partitioning. 

My only wish for umsdos is that it would support dblspaced (compressed) 
harddrives; however, I have an idea for a solution:

Besides experimenting with Linux and it's umsdos fs variant, I also have messed
with dosemu. It seems to me that dosemu could be modified/merged 
into umsdos to provide the necessary linkage to a doublespaced or stacker 
logical hd.  This would avoid entirely the problem of trying to come up with 
dblspace or stacker compatible routines.      

If I understood the docs correctly, umsdos fs was mostly a hack of the dos fs
code. It seems natural that the dosemu code be cannibalized (strip out every- 
thing except what is necessary for MS-DOS to boot and load the dblspace.bin
to mount the compressed-volume-file harddisk) so as to add dblspace compression
to umsdos. Some additional interface code may or may not be necessary at this 
point. 
 Basically, the emudos (using it's dos fs code) should now talk to the hacked 
dosemu (who is running MS-DOS & dblspace) for it's disk accesses
instead of talking to the hd device driver or dos parition directly.

FIRST OF ALL SORRY FOR THE TOOOO LONNNNG LINEESSSSSSS.

Hi world,

So far I have received many reactions from GREAT to shut this guy up in a lunny
bin.
But I think that most people didn't really understand my first message. I said
I
wanted to have the 486 do all the I/O work and thus working as a server with
the 
transputer as client.

Well I've been searching high and low in articels concering transputer
hardware. And
found some advertisments about SCSI 1/2 controllers as a T-RAM module. So the 
need for ans AFS (Alien file server) might not be so great, or maybe it would
because
I would need a way to boot the transputer (it would be possible to boot from a
EPROM)..

And now let me try to explain the idea again, so simple as possible:
  The idea was that it would be possible to open a window under LINUX with X11 
  and have the Transputer running in there. Doing some number crunching in
parallel
  with the 486. And there for a part of the LINUX code would be needed to run
on the
  Transputer.

The port wouldn't be written in OCCAM 2 because that would give me a HUGE pain
in the BUM!!!! Because of the way how OCCAM 2 is written. But in C and compiled
with
a 3L-C Compiler. Which I am planning on buying soon. If I can get it for a nice
price. 
And not for 600 pounds which is around 1800 Guilders and that's a bit much, for
a 
student that has to live of something around 300 guilders a month. So I'll be
looking 
at 3L if they don't have a studente version or a student price, for their
compiler.

Or if someone out there in internet land would like to part with his 3L
compiler, I am
interested.!!!

I hope this makes life easyer for you folks out there.

I used to get this all the time. Then I changed the timing on my motherboard,
and it went away completely--I haven't had a problem since, and I've rebuilt
the kernel many times.

This has been discussed before, and the culprits blamed were ISA<->memory
transfers, motherboard memory itself, and the phases of the moon. It
would appear that simple tests, especially DOS- or Windows-based tests,
don't pound the machine hard enough, so rebuilding the Linux kernel is a
pretty good test. In any case, you can imagine that if gcc started paging,
and one of the paging transfers had an error in it, thus changing the
code, you could get a seg. violation. One problem with the kernel, at
least the last time I looked, is that a lot of the hardware traps
are mapped to one signal, segmentation violation. I'm not sure if that's
a POSIX thing or what, but it does make figuring out what's going on 
a bit of a hassle.

Anyway, if your motherboard has lots of settings like mine does, start
changing things like ISA bus speed, DRAM wait states, ISA bus wait states,
etc. If it doesn't, you might be SOL. I think the thing I did that made
the most dramatic difference was slowing the ISA bus down to 8 Mhz.
A lot of motherboards have a 12Mhz setting, and many ISA bus cards
are unreliable at 12Mhz. Others have found that replacing SIMMs cured their
problems. 

Also, if you have a 50Mhz DX motherboard, like I do, you might just want to
replace it with a 66Mhz DX2...Oh, another thing I've remembered--when I
first got my motherboard, it crashed a lot, and the problem turned out to be
that I had a 50Mhz motherboard with cache RAM for a 33Mhz motherboard, so
make sure that your cache SRAMs are fast enough.

May I suggest rather than using MVS as a model for your async I/O support,
get a recent draft of the IEEE POSIX1003.4 (nee' 1b) standard.  This was
recently ratified by the IEEE real-time POSIX committee and although not
perfect contains much insight into the problems you discuss.  The hassle
is that the IEEE has decided to make money on their standards so the documents
are not ftp'able.

Since Linux is already 1003.1 compliant, getting the pieces to 1003.4 in place
seems like the "Portable" thing to do.

Are you using one of the newer "programmable" keyboards, such as the
Northgage Omnikey or the Focus 9001?  I'm using the latter, and get
similar messages when I press the PF keys.  I just got the keyboard, 
but I'll look into it when I get the time.

Speculations about how to circumvent the GPL should go
to gnu.misc.discuss only.  Followup-To: is set.

The GPL says:
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.

I think this explicitly forbids your proposal, and rightly so, because
what you propose is the same as an .o file - I can trivially
convert the .o file to an .s file that will recreate the .o after assembly,
so the two forms are the same.

IMO binary-only driver distributions would clearly violate the GPL,
and it is up to Linus to allow them explicitly. I also think it would
be a Good Thing to do that.

  Patrick

I am currently doing a port of gcc2.5.8 to a t8000 transputer as part of my
Master of
Computer Science requirements and I can tell you that that is hard enough
without 
having to worry about that weird transputer architecture for other things. My 
suggestion is try if you want to but prehaps your first port should be
something smaller
unless you are really aware of the subtle details of the compiler, filesystems
etc.

The kernel code I have changed has been mostly C anyway. There is possibly some
assembler
still but it is a fairly small amount.

That's their problem. You can always reverse engineer it.

No but you are required to give the source in its 'preferred form' so you

If you've tried playing with this you'll find that its not accurate and
it doesn't cover a lot of the 'hard' stuff like mapping a drive. I got a

From: braun@physik.uni-kl.de (Martin Braun)
Date: Tue, 29 Mar 1994 15:33:59 GMT


Hello all,

  Yesterday I tried to make xconsole work for normal users and
found that it is not sufficient to set proper permissions for
/dev/console. The method used by xconsole to catch console output
is as follows (xconsole.c:OpenConsole):
        .
        .       
        .
            struct stat sbuf;
            /* must be owner and have read/write permission */
            if (!stat("/dev/console", &sbuf) &&
                (sbuf.st_uid == getuid()) &&
                !access("/dev/console", R_OK|W_OK))
            {
        .
        .       
        .
#if defined(USE_PTY) && !defined(SOLX86)
                int     on = 1;

                if (get_pty (&pty_fd, &tty_fd, ttydev, ptydev) == 0 &&
                    ioctl (tty_fd, TIOCCONS, (char *) &on) != -1)
                {
                    input = fdopen (pty_fd, "r");
                }
#endif
        .       
        .
        .
Even though the permissions for /dev/console are set properly this fails
in the TIOCCONS ioctl (output of strace):
...
stat("/dev/console", {dev 3 2 ino 42 mode 020622 nlink 1 uid 1418 gid 1400 size

0 ...}) = 0
getuid() = 1418
access("/dev/console", 06) = 0
open("/dev/ptyp0", RDWR) = -1 (Try again)
open("/dev/ptyp1", RDWR) = 4
open("/dev/ttyp1", RDWR) = 5
ioctl(5, TIOCCONS, 0xbffffb04) = -1 (Operation not permitted)
...
This happens  because under linux this ioctl may only be used by root 
(from linux/drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:tty_ioctl):
        .
        .       
                case TIOCCONS:
                        if (IS_A_CONSOLE(dev)) {
                                if (!suser())
                                        return -EPERM;
                                redirect = NULL;
                                return 0;
                        }
                        if (redirect)
                                return -EBUSY;
                        if (!suser())
                                return -EPERM;
                        if (IS_A_PTY_MASTER(dev))
                                redirect = other_tty;
                        else if (IS_A_PTY_SLAVE(dev))
                                redirect = tty;
                        else
                                return -ENOTTY;
                        return 0;
                case FIONBIO:
        .
        .

IMHO this is a bug which breaks xconsole. I am not a kernel hacker
and can't provide a fix for it. Suggestions and comments are
appreciated.

One possibility is to use mirror, the package that some archive sites

                (shortcut packages/mirror)

Although it was originally intended to be used for continuous upkeep
of a collectin it works great for getting files just once. One thing
you have to watch out for (especially if you are doing the ftpping
from a linux box): check the logs when the program has finished for
the files that it timed out on. You will have to go back and get
those; either by hand or just run mirror again (it only gets files it
doesn't already have).

   Well, I want to encourage you to do it.  It will stop all these
   people, who say: "But linux does not run on a multiprocessor", if
   it runs on your plug in transputer :-)

While I wouldn't like to discourage your creative efforts, there's a
few things you should know before you start.

From my limited understanding of the internal structure of the Linux
kernel and also based on what it provides to the programmer, I don't
think that it will be possible to port the kernel to the T4/8 series
transputer architecture.

The T4/8 series transputers do not have the hardware to support
virtual memory. Nor do they have the ability to protect areas of
memory from other processes. Since these are the fundamental
assumptions made in the Linux kernel, I think this is where you luck
out ...

   My idea was to do as minimal work as possible in the beginning.  Is
   it possible, that a process on the transputer sends a signal to the
   Intel chip?  Furthermore, is it possible to map transputer memory
   into the Intel address space?  In that case, all the system calls
   could be processed by the standard Linux kernel, and all you had to
   programme was a small transputer kernel, which transfers the system
   calls to the Intel.

Yes, it is possible to send signals to the Intel CPU, depending on
what protocol you use between the T80x and the x86. However, assuming
that you are going to be using standard transputer boards, the major
problem is the bandwidth available between the two CPUs. However, it
might be possible to come up with a reasonable way to pass system
calls back to the x86. The difficulty will be that the kernel will not
have access to the memory of the processes. Memory mapping is not
possible with standard hardware.

   Not much of the Linux kernel is written in assembler, check with
   the header files in /usr/include/asm.  Non-assembler versions of
   the string routines as found in /usr/include/linux/strings.h are
   found in the GNU C-Library for example.

   But you may have to learn about your Transputer's assembly to get
   things rolling.

Yep - I'd think so too. And once you've done that, you might want to
reconsider. Transputer assembly reflectes the CPU architecture, and
it's a long way from that of the x86 !


Overall, the best approach may be to look at Minix instead. For one
thing, there is already someone working on a port to the T4/8 CPUs
which is always a good thing.

The major advantage though is that Minix does not (in the base 1.6
version) provide virtual memory. It allocates fixed size memory areas
to processes - which should suit the transputer very well. You could
then allocate a guard area at the end of the stack, and check it
sometimes to make sure that the stack hasn't overflowed.

The kernel structure of Minix is also suitable for transputers. It is
composed of a number of independant processes that communicate using
small messages. I would think that with some hacking you should be
able to put a memory manager and scheduler on each processor, and get
them to cooperate in executing processes. The filesystem could run
either on the x86 or the root transputer.

Another thing that might be fun - I think that the original Minix
filesystem is single threaded. It would make sense to rewrite this as
a multi-threaded server.


In my opinion, this project would provide a similar amount of 'fun'
but with a much lower frustration potential that attempting to port
Linux. Who knows, it might even be working by the end of your
holidays ?

Just a followup to say that at least one other has similar woes.
I started at 0.99pl8, and kernel rebuilds were rock solid for a while.
Somewhere around pl12, I started seeing just exactly what is reported
above.  I'm still seeing it with pl15h.

I've commented about it a couple of times in comp.os.linix.whatever, and
responses indicated that it had to be a hardware error.  That's reinforced
by rock-solid rebuilds on other linux installations.  However, I don't
recall seeing anything like this with anything but cc, and can't localize
it to a hardware problems.  Exercising the disks by copying massive amounts
of data works OK, and standalone memory-test programs run overnight report
no problems.

For now, I'm just living with it.  I restart "make zImage" as needed, and
reboot if that doesn't work (the problem appears less frequently on a
recently booted system).

I have currently a plip-connection running between a linux-box and 
msdos running crynwr plip.com and ncsa-telnet or pcip_pkt. The changes I 
made are: 
 -  strobe bit-levels need to be inverted
 -  throw out plip_type logic: send as ethernet would do
 -  length byte order inverted
 -  there was a "bug" in the send_byte: To allow the data-bits to
    settle first before they are strobed, they were put without the
    strobe bit first, but without masking off the high nibble of the
    data, so sometimes (if data's 0x10 bit was set, this settle-logic
    failed, and this resulted in receive-errors in dos-plip.com, because
    there is only a single asm-in, which is not repeated after the strobe
    is seen ...
If someone wants the diffs, send mail ...
