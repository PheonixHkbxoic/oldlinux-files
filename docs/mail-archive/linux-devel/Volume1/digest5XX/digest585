Hmm...  SLIP (CSLIP actually) has been rock solid for me at 1.0.4
passing 8-10 MB of news and ftp per day.  I had a few problems with
general protection warnings at pre-1.0 and 1.0.2, but never had any ftp
breakdowns.  What version of ftp are you running, and what are your
configurations?  Maybe you should try a fresh compile of Alan Cox's new
"ftp".

The 4 bit cable is for the older parralel ports that are output only.
It uses the status lines to transmit the information.  The 8 bit cable
will work with the newer ports that can send and receive on the data
lines.  I believe it works the same way as Laplink on DOS, and is
probably the same as the amiga cable.

Fine. But I could not find any header file with the va_list or va_dcl
declaration. Under HP-UX the declarations are in varargs.h, somebody suggested
that under Linux there exists stdargs.h ... but I did not find it in
SLACKWARE 1.1.2 . Maybe simply I have to copy more header files from other (?)
distributions ?

BTW, where to find more complete set of header files for Linux (and, maybe,
related man-pages ?) ?

On my DRx2-20/40 running Linux 1.0.4 + lx_inline with the full version of
my patch and the BogoBoost patch- I get the same..  Without the lx_inline
patch, I get 15.99 BogoMips..  I guess the inline stuff didn't do as much
good as the authors claimed :-(.

For the record, what brand of DLC motherboard do you have?  I've had reports
that the OPTI chipset + AMI BIOS motherboards don't enable the cache when
running any operating system that doesn't use the BIOS (ie, the patch is
needed even though the motherboard claims to be DLC aware).  If yours works,
I'd like to list your motherboard as one that works in my README file.

GAS is there, on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/GCC. Unless I'm mistaken the

The "overrun" numbers should actually be labelled "packets for which

Would you consider "monitor"-like system information ? memory handling
(including swap utilization), disk I/O statistics, processes info, per-

Linux becomes stable solid system and commercial developers will start

He is probably thinking of the charset most commonly labelled EUC
for Extended Unix Charset.
It is a charset intended mostly for Japanese usage, I think.
(And it's *huge* - like 16K or 32K characters).

I would look for some character set group, not this group, to get info.

Hi world,

So far I have received many reactions from GREAT to shut this guy up in a lunny bin. But
I think that most people didn't really understand my first message. I said I wanted to 
have the 486 do all the I/O work and thus working as a server with the transputer as a
client.

Well I've been searching high and low in articels concering transputer hardware. And found
some advertisments about SCSI 1/2 controllers as a T-RAM module. So the need for ans
AFS (Alien file server) might not be so great, or maybe it would because I would need a way
to boot the transputer (it would be possible to boot from a EPROM)..

And now let me try to explain the idea again, so simple as possible:
  The idea was that it would be possible to open a window under LINUX with X11 and have
the Transputer running in there. Doing some number crunching in parallel with the 486. And
there for a part of the LINUX code would be needed to run on the Transputer.

The port wouldn't be written in OCCAM 2 because that would give me a HUGE pain in the BUM!!!!
Because of the way how OCCAM 2 is written. But in C and compiled with a 3L-C Compiler.
Which I am planning on buying soon. If I can get it for a nice price. And not for 600 pounds
which is around 1800 Guilders and that's a bit much, for a student that has to live of something
around 300 guilders a month. So I'll be looking at 3L if they don't have a studente version or
a student price, for their compiler.

Or if someone out there in internet land would like to part with his 3L compiler, I am 
interested.!!!

I hope this makes life easyer for you folks out there.

Just for the record, my TI486DLC-40 works just fine.

It is on a VL, 128k ext. cache board that was meant to
work with the DLC.

Furthermore, it is humming along with an IIT 3C87-40
with no problems whatsoever.
I get 15.97 BogoMips... not bad for < $300 (board+cpu+mathco)

HOWEVER, things were not always so good.  The first DLC
I had in this board would totally bomb out if booted up
with internal cache enabled. At first, I thought this was normal,
since the DLC is a "fake" 486, but on speaking to the vendor
I learned otherwise.  They happily exchanged chips (admirable of them)
and sure enough, the new one worked.

Hi,

I'm having trouble with printing. I have two linux boxes, connected
by 10 Mbps Ethernet. When i 'lpr' a file from my remote machine to my printer, 
it is sent across the network to the other linux box and printed. But, during
the printing, I'm not able to 'lpq' from the remote machine. It hangs until
the job is finished and then returns 'no entries'. Lpq from the local (the
box where the printer is attached to) works fine.

It seems that the one of the lpd which is printing listens to the udp port,
not the one that should listen to the port.

Any idea's?

                        Stefan.

Get the SysVinit-2.4 package, it now has support for catching power

I am afraid that I doubt it - you may get it USABLE with a little bit of
work, but getting the bugs out is a different matter.  IBM MVS has had
asynchronous I/O as part of its base design since the very beginning
(whether you include PCP or not), and it STILL has bugs in it.  Some UNIX
fanatics used to say that this was the fault of the misdesign of MVS, but
that was before vendors started to implement asynchronous I/O in UNIX :-)

Every vendor that has attempted this task has had a foul job, and by no
means all have succeeded.  Please don't think that I am trying to put you
off - I am merely pointing out that success in this context is not a simple
question of removing bugs.  If you end up with a usable system, you have
succeeded, even if there are still outstanding and insoluble bugs.

Your list of nasty questions includes many of the hairy areas, but don't
forget interactions with swapping and process scheduling, what to do when
queues back up, error handling when in anomalous states and so on.  These
complex interactions are the areas where bugs lurk, irrespective of how
much development and debugging the system has been through.

If you can find a set of IBM MVT manuals (especially the SAM PLM and the
Debugging Handbook), you may find some useful hints on techniques and how
to handle some of the problems you mention.  I say IBM MVT, because that
was the last system that was relatively free of restrictions on the reuse
of the technology.  It remains copyright, of course.
