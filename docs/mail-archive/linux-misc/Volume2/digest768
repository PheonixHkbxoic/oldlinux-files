Yes, but so what?  Proper names are not neccesarily common names.  The fact
is that anything which bothers to call itself a "disk operating system" is
most likely an obsolete design anyway.

Yet come companies have become so definite that their names have become
the common term for the product.  It's not proper to call a kleenex a
kleenex, but it certainly is common.  The fact is that regardless of the
proper name of things, people are going to occasionally use a different
common term.  DOS is one of these things, so is Windows (or Windoze if
you prefer).

Here we talk of proper names and you don't even use the correct ones above.
X is called simply that, and MIT, I believe it is, has long grumbled about
people calling it X-Windows.  X Windowing System might be acceptable, I seem
to recall that their objection is to the X being directly tied to the plural
form of window.  I've never heard of the Amiga environment being called
Amiga Windows, either.  I believe the proper name is still Intuition (and
Workbench which represents sort of an AmigaDOS frontend, but is not really
the windowing system proper).  Most people don't seem to be getting confused
as to what is what, so why worry?

Subject: Mail Order Linux Workstation Vendors
Date: Thu, 15 Sep 94 05:03:05 GMT

I have been keeping a list of "Mail Order Linux Workstation Vendors"
which I post from time to time in this and other newsgroups.

All of the vendors listed below will install Linux on the machines that
they sell but provide varying amounts of support for it.  I have not dealt
with any of these vendors except 20/20 Technologies so I cannot recommend
them to you.  Both SW Technology and Fintronic USA, Inc. are listed in the
Distribution-HOWTO and 20/20 Technologies should also appear there soon.

Three vendors (20/20 Technologies, SW Technology and Fintronic USA, Inc.)
sell Pentium based workstations which run Linux and the X Window System.
In order to get a feel for the prices these vendors were charging,
I asked each vendor to give me a quote for the following configuration:

*       66MHz P5 CPU with heatsink & cooling fan (Intel Pentium or equivalent)
*       PCI system board with 256kbyte 15ns cache upgradeable to 512kbyte,
        three busmaster PCI slots and five 16bit ISA slots
        (ASUS I-P5MP3 or equivalent) (Intel Mercury II chipset or equivalent)
*       16Mbyte 70ns system memory, expandable to 192Mbyte
*       PCI video card with 1Mbyte RAM (Orchid Kelvin 64 or equivalent)
*       15" 0.27mm dot pitch 1280x1024 non-interlaced color monitor
        (Viewsonic or equivalent)
*       32bit busmaster PCI Fast SCSI II adaptor (NCR53C810 or equivalent)

Next Step is easier to install, if you have the right hardware.  It is 
extreamly pickiy about hardware.  You can get the Compatabillity guide 
from ftp.next.com.

: 3. Which one has more choice of application software?

Well, with an x package like coexist, NS can run ns, unix, and x 
software.  It runs unix software fine. I have compiled several apps for 
it with little or no problems.  You just can't run x out of the box.

: 4. Which one is faster (for the same task) ?

Depends on what compiler was used.  gcc is better than cc.  Os stuff 
Linux is better.  But then again, Linux isn't wrap-aound post script.

: 5. Which one has a capability that the other doesn't have?

NS has this awsome environment for development.  It makes borlands look 
silly.  It is completly object orinted.  Also the GUI is the easiest.  It 
makes the Mac look complicated.

FVWM on linux isn't as easy to set upo and run.  Nad configureing it 
takes some hacking.

: 6. Which one has better future? (this is a question 
for discussion :    and not for a definite answer.)

Well, NS is growing strong in the buisness world, because of the ease of 
use and application building.  Linux is growing popular with college 
students and hackers.

I use both along with Macsa, pcs, and several UNIX's.  I can tell you 
from experince that NS is a far beter OS.  But it has a high price.  It 
is in the perfomance catogory as NT and requires a lot of system to run.  
I have seen it run on as little as a Dell 486dx2-50 w/ jaws video and 16m 
ram.  It was way slower than our NeXTStaion Turbo (a 25Mgz 040 w/ 32 megs).
We now have a 486dx2-66 w/16 megs.  It's a duel boot with NS and linux.  
NS is a lot more relaible, but slower.  Linux is a lot faster, but less 
realiable.

I am moving to Linux soon (from a mac) and hope to run NS in the future.

I use both regularly so feel free to email me with any spacific questions 
you may have.

I hope I have helped

Subject: Linux X DOOM performance (explanation)
Date: 16 Sep 1994 01:51:36 -0500

For those of you curious about the different performances under
DOS and Linux, here's some explanation.

What you may think of as the obvious culprit, X Windows, is not
the only problem.  X really doesn't slow things down much if you're
in single-pixel mode, not running anything else requiring X services
while the game is running, and have enough RAM to keep its active
footprint in memory.  Nor is context switching for the X server or
sound server code a nasty hit as this is done quite rarely in the
scope of things.

The Linux version has no assembly.  This affects the texture-mapping
speed quite a bit.  First, there's the obvious speed payoff of
doing anything in the inner loop of an algorithm in assembly.
Second, in DOS, the routines render directly to the frame buffer
using a mode which ISA cards suffer only their bus speed and not
the width.  That's probably quite a large chunk of the performance
hit as there is no end-of-rendering screen slam for this.

The hit from sound is experienced in both DOS and Linux, but the
hit under DOS is much smaller.  This is for several reasons.  Once
again, the DOS inner-loop is in assembly.  Also, the DOS version
mixes channels at a time instead of samples at a time.  This is a
lot faster.  The Linux sound code was almost straight from the SGI
code (where something processing an 11kHz sound stream is completely
inconsequential to system resources).

So what you're playing with is a completely C game in X with very
hastily-written sound code for the SGI.  It's basically a tribute
to what you get nowadays with -O from modern C compilers.  Not bad.

Actrually, you just didn't know the tricks of the trade. You can view
just about anything you create in ez by doing

ezprint -t file.ez | groff -ept >file.ps

and THEN using ghostview on it.

There are two problems with why ez isn't talked about much:

1) Development on it is done by a very small number of people, and it has
  fallen out of favour at its own college development site.

2) It can be a pain to set up, and there is no easy (ahem) way to just
   compile the editor. It is part of the humungeous package of AUIS, and
   thus will be forever buried in obscurity.

   (To fix this, there should be a separate release of JUST the editor.
    But given the attitudes and priorities of the developers, I doubt
    this will ever happen)

I've got the Corel 3 for Unix demo CDROM, and yes, it has on it the

Even the license manager worked (for SCO).

Call Corel and ask for the demo CDROM.
