Phil... great mag!!! looking forward to the november issue!!

Oh, and thanks for running the FlagShip piece under NEW PRODUCTS!

We are working on an article for you about the porting process, and what we
ran into.... and I just submitted another on the product, what it is, and
how it benefits the Linux community to Mike... but it bounced, so I sent
it to lydia.....

Hope the email stuff gets straightened out for you....

Subject: DLL Problems with staticvars
Date: 10 Oct 1994 16:13:16 GMT

I'm having some problems with the DLLs under linux.  It may not be the DLLs,
but a misunderstanding on my part.

Basically, I've got a static object in a library file which doesn't appear
to be properly constructed.

For instance:

class A
  {
  public:
    A(int a) { _a = a; }

    int _a;
  };

static A aa(4);

This code doesn't load up aa::_a with four when I load the sharable library.
At least it doesn't appear to.  Are there some rules or gotchas that I need
to be aware of when using DLLs?

I do have a number of objects with static members which DO get properly
initialized, so I'm quite confused.

Is there maybe a FAQ on DLLs or something?  I'm using DLL Tools 2.11.

Please email any responses to allen@chesapeake.rps.slb.com

Thanks,

Marc L. Allen

Actually, the Linux kernel supports multithreading through the clone()
system call, but I believe libc doesn't support multithreading yet.
Remember, since threads share the same address space, multithreading
is visible to libc, whereas multitasking is not.

It's normally available first, then debugged then submitted into the main
kernel. Of course people who play with alpha test code do so at their own
risk

Thats a bug in curses under Linux - rebuild talk with ncurses. I await the
new libc to see if the new BSD curses fixes all the bugs.

Pity they wont tell anyone how to program it so only their drivers can be

Get a 3c589 and you can sit running Linux with a good many more than 6

Your internet provider's router must know to send data to your Laptop
via your pentium.  This is normally done by haveing 'routed' in your
machine provide RIP advertising to peer routers. It can also be done
by having your provider establish static routes to your LAN 
addresses.  In my similar situation, I have found it sufficient
to add '-g -s' (overkill?) flags to the routed startup in 
/etc/rc.d/rc.net AFTER my LAN is ifconfigED.  Sometimes it seems
I have to kill and restart routed after running a while but
Ive been up for a couple hours now w/o problem (at the moment
the LAN station is running IBM TCP/IP DOS

Reply-To: pp000547@interramp.com (Bill Hogan)


  Hello.

  I just noticed that the Pine binary I have on my pC does not 
spell-check.

  When I press ^T (in COMPOSE) I *instantly* get "Done spelling check"
even if the text consists of a text-string like "qwerty".

  Also, after I press ^T, the ^G [set help] on the menu gets
overwritten by text of which I can only see this little bit: "or
directory" -- which looks like a piece of "No such file or directory".
 
  Aha, I say, `pine' can't find its spelling-checker, so I go to see
what spelling-checker Pine is looking for and `man pine' tells me this
is `spell(1)'.

  So, I did `man 1 spell'.

  Nada.

  So, I thought, I must have deleted the binary by accident somehwere
along the line.

  I checked my TA CD-ROM.

  I checked my sunsite.ls-lR.

  I checked ftp.cdrom.com.

  I can't find spell(1) anywhere.

  I guess I never noticed this little quirk before because until
recently I was only using my modem to dial into a shell account, but
now I have a PPP connection.

  Does everyone else already know about this?

  No big deal (I use GNUS and RMAIL now, anyway) but I would still
like to be able to use Pine from time to time -- with a
spelling-checker.

  Thank you!

Well, one more thing to report on that front.  Due to seemingly
random errors with mail, we did a thorough check.  We found that
'smail' was linked to CD. When CD not mounted, sendmail was just
not started, and thus no connection to sendmail could be made.

And,  copying smail from CD to harddisk may not solve all the
problem, as at least one (I forgot which one) of smail-linked
programs (eg runq, sendmail) was not linked to smail, but
rather to CD, as well.

To other yggdrasil CD users, it is advisable to go
through at least /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/X11/lib, /etc,
and /usr/etc to check whether softlinks to CD are 
suitable for you.  This is of course based on
our limited experience of installing about 250MB of stuff
from CD to the harddisk. If you install significantly
more or less than 250MB, you may not have the concern.
