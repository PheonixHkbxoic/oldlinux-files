I don't have a 16-bit sound card on the right machine, but on the SGI
version (which presumably is similar) there are only sound effects,
unfortunately.

Most likely not, since DOOM! occationally changes the colormap it
uses.

The only thing about this that really saddens me is that ddt thinks
that the Linux version doesn't generate revenue; I will be getting the
registered version next week to use on my Linux system!

Well, I have a Corel PhotoCD sampler, which wouldn't mount under the
old nec-cdr-260 driver, but mounts under the new one.  Also, I have
heard other reports in this group of people with photo-cd.

I had the same problem. At that time I was running kernel 1.1.45. Nothing

kernel 1.1.29. I installed it, recompiled dosemu and it worked almost

Martin not only accused me implicitly of software-piracy (see this
thread a few weeks ago), he now threatens to set his legal bloodhounds
on this thread.  Obviously it is his right to do so but it effectively
portraits the horror that established firms feel when confronted with
new developments.

And it is so bloody stupid... Linux offers a new way to boost
WP-sales, which is a BIG seller, and all they can do is wave with
lawyers and insert fingers in dykes, because it might threaten that
Unixware of theirs, that is a SMALL seller and likely will remain so.

Guess in which department Martin (or should I say: Mister Sohnius)
is working...

I've installed it, and no problems.  It appears that amateur radio
operators may be in for a thrill, and there's a new Ethernet card
(LANCE?) supported.  It's fairly mild for an upgrade, but I don't
want to be caught 10 versions back and have something 'really big'
hit the streets; at least for now, reversing patches isn't that
much of an issue.

I was thinking about this today.

Linux Doom users who register should make it clear that they are
registering because of the Linux version.  This might help open Id's
eyes to Linux's potential.

I don't think you can pass a parameter (-i) to the shell field in the
password file.  Put the thing in a script and use the script for the
shell (although the chance might exist that the person invoking the
script could break out of it and have access to the O/S).

Hey! THe max is 512k officially, and 2 meg unofficially.
ANd it can run OS9, too!

(for those of you who don't know, OS9 is by a company called micro_ware_, 
and is vaguely unixlike in that it is preemptively multitasking,
multiuser, and has a lot of i/o libraries fairly similar to the unix ones.
OS9 is used by bigger companies like Philips (In the CD-I machines, even!)
for real-time multitasking stuff.

It's usually on a 68000 platform.
Unfortunately, on the coco3 you have to deal with semented memory, and no
memory protection. Kind of a cool way to get into "real OS's", thou
I have a system for free if anyone can use it. (with K&R C compiler!)
floppy system only.

(a multitasking, modular kernel in less than 128k. You gotta be impressed
by that)

I'm running it with a 486/66 and a trident 8900CL, which I hear is the slowest
non-accelerated card you can get. (does this strike anyone as ironic)  Doom 
seems to run at about the same speed as DOS, maybe even faster.  Of course I
have sound in DOS but I had to turn it off in Linux.  Anyone know what you
need for sound? Kernel >1.1.23?  Over 105 linux luck points?

The reasoning I have for wanting to start a biz.* heirachy for linux is 
that there are commercial vendors now addresses the need for 
professional Linux support. Professional support costs money...ie; is 
commercial and people on the net (including myself) have a tendacy to be 
a little snide towards commercial posts in non commercial areas. I would 
like to open a group that would allow people like myself, Yggdrasil, 
Info-magic to post ads. These ads would be for the person who wants to 
try things like Linux but does not want to have to deal with hunting for 
help with their problems. Also it would give a place for vendors to have 
a forum to discuss problems with product and current sales.

Me too.

Maybe the reason software development companies are reluctant to 
develop for Linux is how they view the user base.  We all got our software
for free, so maybe they don't expect that we would pay for anything. Also
there may be a big fear of piracy. Since we are "better" with PC's than
the average user, then they see us all as "hackers", too some hacker=pirate.

I saw an earlier post asking "How do I register Linux Doom?" I feel if
more of us stated they we were willing to *BUY* a piece of software for
Linux and actually went through with it, more companies would see that there
is money to be made from Linux users and would start developing high
quality software.  Let's face it, no company will develop where the 
potential for profit is weak.

The bottom line, if we want to see more high quality software for Linux
like Doom, we're going to have to pull out our wallets. 

More thoughts, but that's enough for now.

To convert fax-data I found the best way to use the tiff-tools found on
sgi.com: graphics.tiff. With "fax2tiff -M -4 (several pages of fax-data)"
and "tiff2ps -2a fax.tif >fax.ps" you get highly compressed level-2
postscrtipt file of your whole(!) document. Now you can apply all your
postscript tools, like psnup, psbook e.t.c. And no excessive use of memory.
And ghostview to lok at them!

Regarding "g2topbm", the is a different version in the
"mgetty+sendfax"-package from Gert Doering which is also beware of memory.

The original pbmtools sometime use the pnm-format as intermediate output,
which is 3 byte per pixel. Try to rotate a pbm-picture!
