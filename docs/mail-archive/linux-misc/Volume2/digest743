The easiest solution is to use the patch I posted several months
ago and apply that to lmain.c.  It closes the hole correctly and
doesn't require any extra wrapper commands.

Just to echo my disdain for binary-only distributions, I had a friend
who recently was forced to buy a Linux CD pretty much because the
spare CD I have was binary-only.  So far the only people making money
off of Linux are the CD shops.

Sounds like it would run best with no window manager at all (or any other

(I *SHOULD* say RTFM, since *MY* sportser manual tells me the answer...)

Reeally what you should do is set the port speed to the highest possible
rate the the chip will support. If you have a UART 16550, then go ahead
and set it to 38400 (or even 56700??) Remember that a 14400 modem will do
compression and the such, and I have HEARD (never seen) that on good
days, when the moon is right, and so on, you _might_ get a throughput rate
of 56kB.

I run mine at 38400 with a UART 16550, and it works just fine.

I hear that linuxxdoom uses udp sockets, so term is a no-op.

First of all, thanks Dave. 

I have some problems also with the sound: I have been said that there is 
no music only effects (to confirm) In fact, I just hear garbage.

The pixel doubling, tripling, etc blur the window.

When using the Ctrl-Key (FIRE) at the same time than the arrows, I switch 
to the other rooms (screens). The only way out of this is to run Olwm instead
of fvwm or others mwm like.

The network part seems to not be compatible with SGIxdoom. Hope it will be
in the future.

I patched my registered version 1.2 to 1.666 but the file is not recognized
by linuxxdoom.

I guess Dave was "under pressure" to release this version and I thank him
again.

If my memory serves, Martin suggested that you wouldn't be likely
candidate for a free review copy. He might be implying that you
wouldn't be likely to help sales.  You don't need to expand on that
in a bad way,  and then blame it on Martin.

If WP is going to give away software, why not give it to those of
us that paid for the development?  Like me, I have bought it, DOS
and Unix, since DOS 4.2.  Looks silly doesn't it, they should make
me pay, because I did the in the past, and give it you for free, in
that hopes that the best selling UNIX application of all time can
sell more?  If they give it away, they aren't going to be able to
sell any more.  And if they give to you when I'm the one that paid to
see it written, are you going to give them a job?  You can write your
own editor; WordPerfect is for business.  And if you need it for 
business, shame on you for wanting to sell another's labor as your own.

>lawyers and insert fingers in dykes, because it might threaten that

If  UW doesn't get any bigger than NetWare, it will do just fine.  Lots
of UW users have respect for Linux, but recognize that it is not all
things to all people.  You don't need to wack UW just because Novell
people don't want to give you their work for free.

virus spreads on boot floppys.
when the key gets of 0x0ff it then

now it writes this byte to sector 0, head 0, Cyl 0... etc etc.
and just keeps going till say sec 17, Head 4, Cyl 600

Now how do you expect to be protected from that???
some ppl do run dos and linux...
so it is possable for this to happen...
 So if you run dos/linux/sco etc.
best bet is to run someting like scan in your dos side.

Yes.  The 34F is the fastest SCSI card I've ever used with Linux, including the
new VESA BusLogics (the BusLogics have other features that recommend them, tho.
The 445S, for example, is an excellent card, but a tad slower than the 34F and
somewhat more expensive.)

This would not be related to the 34F.  It certainly never happened with mine...

Ultrastor is gone, true.  However, Adaptec offers no support for Linux either. 
So long as the Ultrastor arrives functional, you get equal support from either :)

Why?  Most udp programs work with term.  I'm willing to bet that if
linuxxdoom was compiled with -include /usr/local/src/term/termnet.h
and -ltermnet it would work with no modifications to the source code.
In fact I've been thinking of editing the binary to change the library
references, but since I've nevered tried editing a binary before I'm 
not sure if I'll be successfull.  Changing the jump addresses is easy, but
I don't know if I can selectively change the library name being referenced.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
