I don't understand.
I created the .o file with gcc -O2 -c poly-render.c, but I still don't
understand how to link the poly-render.o file created.  I tried several
of the linking flags in the info gcc documentation: -static, -u _getline
and a few others I forget to no avail.  How does one link a symbol that
isn't in the shared libs in this case?

The owner of one of these, who was trying to install Linux
now has 6 hrs extra of phone bill.

The root/boot disks worked in machines at work.

When he took it back he said OS/2 didn't run, just to make
sure they changed it.

He upgraded to a 486sx2-66 for $24 uk vat inclusive
and binned ideas of Linux when he couldn't get X

I've got an IBM rewritable MO drive, but the answer is the same.
Configure it properly on the SCSI chain on an ID >=2 (it works at 0 or
1, but those are usually reserved for HD's).  Boot up linux,
login as root and execute /sbin/fdisk /dev/sdX1, where X is
the alphabet corresponding to ID (0 = a, 1 = b, so on).  Create your
partitions.  Execute /sbin/mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdX1.  Edit /etc/fstab
to include something like:

/dev/sdX1       /syquest        ext2    noauto,user

and you're set.  I do not use my MO drive most of the time, so I choose
not to mount it at boottime (noauto option).  However, I wanted to
be able to stick in a disk and mount it at any given time, so addd
the user option.  If you do the same thing, you'd insert a cartridge,
type "mount /syquest", use it til you're done, type "umount /syqyest"
then eject the media.

Hope that helps,
Dave.

Title says it all. What can you tell me about this X.25 beast in relation with 
Linux? What can you tell me about it in general? Would you by any chance know 
of some DOS (or Linux!) based software that can be used to at least test if 
the beast is alive? Anybody knows how to configure the card's 4 DIP switches 
and jumper?

I happened to pick up one of these beasties today for an outrageously low 
price at an inventory clearance sale. (Price was so low I don't even mind to 
learn that what I bought is a piece of junk). I am wondering if there is any 
chance to ever get it to sing in my Linux box.

Dear netters,

        In what ways can an IBM-36 be connected to a LINUX box?

        At the moment there is a dosmachine running some kind
        of terminal emulator on a IDCOMM-5251-PLUS card. Via
        this dosmachine files can be up- and downloaded.

        Can this card be used in a LINUX system? Maybe even
        using ftp or rcp?
        What other options are there which fall in the PD or 
        shareware category?

        Thanks for your response.

        Regards,
        Jan Willems.

My older machine is a 386-20 with 2MB RAM.  I use it to play with SLIP

Linux 1.1.52.  Enough to ftp to it, but unusable for serious work.

I'm currently in a fix.  I shutdown my system while doing a tar to tape.  The

AMD had a massive technology trade agreement with Intel that let AMD "copy"
many chips from Intel, including the x86 series processors, just as Intel
could copy many chips from AMD, including bit-slice processors, memory chips,
and programable logic devices. Intel broke this agreement, and it took AMD
years of court battles to make Intel fulfill their contract.

My personal opinion is that Intel began to get worried about AMD competition
when AMD took Intel's 6MHz 80286 processor design, and started turning out 
low cost 10, 12, and 16MHz parts back when Intel was having trouble getting
the chip to run reliably at 8Mhz. AMD then carried 80386 on to 40MHz when
Intel hit the wall at 33MHz. If Intel had continued to honor their
contractural obligations to AMD, I bet we would be seeing 150MHz 486 and
Pentium parts from AMD by now, as well as faster parts from Intel (the
competition might keep them on their toes).

                             6/23/94

This  FAQ  contains information about Linux Journal, the magazine
covering the Linux Community. Topics covered are:
  o general/history
  o content
  o subscriptions
  o writing for LJ
  o advertising in LJ
  o Linux-related product releases
  o consultants directory
  o distributors/retailers
  o misc
  o if all else fails ...

General/History

We see our mission as serving the Linux community  while  working
to  promote  the  use of Linux. Although most of our initial sub-
scribers have come from the Internet we expect half of our future
readers  will  find  LJ as their initial source of information on
Linux. This means that LJ can provide a way for  people  to  find
hardware,  software  and help in getting themselves going. We see
this as a benefit to the Linux newsgroups  by  reducing  "newbie"
questions as well to our advertisers by providing them with a new
way to reach potential new users.

The idea for producing Linux Journal arose in early 1993. In late
February, 1994 we mailed our first issue. The magazine received a
very positive response - both on the Internet and elsewhere.  Is-
sue #4, the August issue, will be released in mid-July.

SSC,  publisher  of  Unix  and  C  pocket references for over ten
years, is now the publisher, with Phil Hughes having the  overall
responsibility  for  the complete publication. Phil's 11 years in
publishing and 15 years of experience with Unix will  be  applied
to  ensure  the  quality of the publication as well as its promo-
tion.

Michael K. Johnson is now the editor.  He  founded  the  original
"man  project",  which  was  the forerunner of the current "Linux
Documentation Project", and maintains a few  Linux  packages,  as
well as the "Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide".

Content

Each  issue  of Linux Journal offers articles that appeal to new-
comers as well as serious technical articles for  long-time  Unix
users. Although LJ is Linux-specific, many of the articles are of
interest to Unix users and other users of freely  redistributable
software.

Regular columns include:
  o Interviews with prominent Linux personalities
  o Linux Programming Tips by Michael Johnson
  o What's GNU? by Arnold Robbins
  o Cooking with Linux by Matt Welsh
  o The Debian Distribution by Ian Murdock
  o New Products
  o Letters to the Editor
  o Book and Product Reviews
  o Linux Counter
  o Linux Consultant's Directory

Features that have appeared in Linux Journal include:
  o Tips for Optimizing Memory Usage by Jeff Tranter
  o Sendmail+IDA by Vince Skahan
  o World Wide Web by Bernie Thompson
  o Comparison of Linux, Windows NT and OS/2 by Bernie Thompson
  o Onyx: a copylefted 4GL by Michael Kraehe
  o Icmake: a new make tool by Frank Brokken and Karel Kubat
  o Linux and Hams: what hams involved in Linux have to say
  o Hints & Tips for Optimizing Linux Disk Usage by Jeff Tranter

Subscriptions

Subscriptions are available internationally through SSC directly.
They are also available in specific regions through our  interna-
tional distributors. Magazines are mailed internationally through
a "surface air lift" service which delivers the magazines quickly
to  the countries of destination where local mail will be handled
by surface delivery.

Subscription rates are as follows:
    $19/year U.S., $24/year Canada, $29/year Foreign
    $34/2 years U.S., $44/2 years Canada, $49/2 years Foreign
    Back issues are available for $4 ($6 airmail) while supplies last.

via email.

Subscriptions start with the next issue of Linux  Journal.   Back
issues,  if  still available, are $4 each or $6 each for air mail
delivery.

Writing for Linux Journal

Articles in Linux Journal cover the range  from  "how  do  I  get
started"  to kernel hacking. We intend to try to strike a balance
so the magazine will be accessible to the newcomer and  yet  con-
tinue to contain useful information to long-term Linux users.

Also,  in  order to legitimize Linux to many business unix users,
we need to offer articles on commercial uses for Linux. They  can
be  in  the  form of documenting a place/job where Linux is being
used commercially, a technical article on the  development  of  a
commercial application, or a review of a commercial product.

If you are considering writing for LJ or have a lead to a commer-
cial use, contact our editor, Michael Johnson. He can be  reached
via e-mail at ljeditor@sunsite.unc.edu, or as Editor, Linux Jour-
nal, P.O. Box 85867, Seattle, WA 98145-1867

Advertising in LJ

Linux Journal is supported by a combination of  subscription  and
advertising  revenue.  Rates  are  competitive  for the number of
readers we reach and our specific  target  audience  matches  the
needs of those who have products targeted to the Linux market.

We currently only offer display advertising. Future plans include
classified advertising and a card deck. If  you  are  interested,
request a media kit and rate card.

Linux-related Product Releases

If  you  have  a  new product that you feel is of interest to the
Linux community, send us a press release. We have a  regular  new
products column and will publish information on the most relevant
products.

We also have a review team and may  be  interested  in  reviewing
specific  products. If you would be willing to make a review copy

Consultant's Directory

We maintain a directory of consultants that work with Linux.  The
directory  is  published periodically in Linux Journal. The first
listing is currently free, and rates for subsequent listings  are
reasonable. To be listed, send your name, company, address, phone
and e-mail and/or fax contact information along with a brief  de-
scription of what you work on to:
    Consultant Directory, Linux Journal, P.O. Box 85867, Seattle, WA 98145-1867

Distributors/Retailers

We are in the process of setting up newsstand distribution of LJ.
Computer Literacy Bookstores and Barnes & Noble carry  the  maga-
zine  and  we  expect to get distribution to many other stores in
the next few months.

If you are aware of a store that should carry LJ you can  suggest
they  contact SSC at (206) 527-3385 about reselling or send us e-
mail at dist@ssc.com with their contact information.

Misc

Q: Is LJ available Electronically?
A: Not yet. Once we have the paper copy under control we plan  to
work on this. It requires contract arrangements with both authors
and advertisers before we can do it.

Q: Can information printed in LJ be reprinted?
A: Authors may use the material with the only  restriction  being
that if they use it immediately they include the phrase "reprint-
ed with permission of Linux Journal". Other people wishing to use
material  should contact LJ.  Permission is generally granted ex-
cept where restricted by author or other prior copyright.

If All Else Fails ...

If your question isn't  answered  here,  send  e-mail  to  ljedi-
tor@sunsite.unc.edu.   We  will send a e-mail response and, if it
is a common question we will add it to this  FAQ.  If  you  don't
have  e-mail,  you  can  fax  questions to (206) 526-0803 or call
(206) 524-8338.

Everyone will give you a differnt opinion. I like my yygdrasil. I've 
never heard of Snow.

Yes, some. To find out exactly what devices are supported, ask your 
dealer or look at the docs (its on the abck of the yygdrasil package.)

Note that a bug in the Linux kernel required an extra boot-floppy to use 
the Fall94 Yygdrasil with Sondy 31a and 33a drives.  if you have  oen of 
these make sure you get the floppy (you can ftp it from Yygdrasil's ftp 
site if all else fails.

The only problem with the 3com card is that it doesn't like Card/Socket
Services.  I had a lot of trouble with this on a Compaq Elite LTE.  I wound
up having to download the updated drivers from 3com.  After that it worked
ok.
