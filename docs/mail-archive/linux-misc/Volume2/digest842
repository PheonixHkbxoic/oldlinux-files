This is the topic of a religious war.  If you look at older versions of the
FAQ, it says the correct pronunciation is the one specified above.  But in
more recent versions, it seems to have changed so that the "i" is a long vowel.
I pronounce it the second way, but I don't think I would hate you if you

The convention (for good reason, since things are slightly different
on all Linuxes) is to have i[345]86-<distribution>-linux; for example:

i486-slackware-linux
i386-debian-linux
i586-yggdrasil-linux

... etc ...

If you are putting together your own distribution following the Linux
Filesystems Standard, I would suggest:

i486-fsstnd-linux or just i486-linux (since the middle is optional,
and is substituted internally by "unknown").

Hey, TeX is a typesetting system. There is NO WAY of converting FROM
ASCII to TeX's code just because there is nothing to convert. I presume,
though that you have an ASCII file that you want to print using TeX. Then
you have to read a good book about TeX and look for a basic structure of
a document.

One more thing: TeX is a LANGUAGE! There is no a specific editor for TeX.
Typing TeX's file can be done in ANY editor. If you want something like
MS Word, you won't get it as nobody ever bothered writing a WYSIWYG
interface to TeX -- it would require a tremendous number of menus and
function keys.

Hi,

I'm just unable to change the volume with workman (or any other prog I haven't

Reply-To: davis@amy.tch.harvard.edu

Hi,

  Most version 4.40 is now ready.  It is available only from
amy.tch.harvard.edu in pub/most.

  What is most?  Most is a more/less type paging program for Unix and VMS 
  that:
      
      0.  All standard more/less features (edit, search, etc...)
      1.  Pages Up, Down, Left, and Right
      2.  Supports multiple windows as well as ``locking'' windows.  Locked
          windows scroll together.
      3.  User definable keybindings
      4.  Secure mode: no editing and looking at files not specified on the
          command line.
      5.  Selective display (folding).  For example, you can display the C
          code 
          
             int main (int argc, char **argv)
             {
                if (argc == 1) {
                  fprintf (stderr, "Not enough arguments\n");
                  exit 0;
                } else {
                  real_main (argc, argv);
                }
                return 0;
             }
             
           as:
           
             int main (int argc, char **argv)
             {
                if (argc == 1) {...
                } else {...
                }
                return 0;
             }

          or:
          
             int main (int argc, char **argv)
             {...
             }

   and much more.
   
  Enjoy,

The old OI binaries were compiled with g++ 2.4.5, which is not compatible
with the new one. But the new one couldn't compile it. I was told they
will make a new binary for a working gcc 2.6.x.

You appear to be in Norway. Check out a bookstore in a bigger city; especially
good are stores specialised in computer books or university bookstores.

In Germany it is also possible to order books through any bookstore.

Good question.  The FAQ *used* to recommend the "i" as in "in."  And that
is how I pronounced it for ~6 months.  Then the FAQ changed its mind :)
and now asserts that the "i" as in "hi."  This is based on the .au file
that Linus put out and is alledgedly based on Linus' Sweedish/Norwegian
accent.  But my ears don't work as well as the FAQs author and I think
one can legitimately construe the .au file as the "in" pronunciation.
So I've given up and choose to pronounce it both ways (though usually
with the "in"-like sound).  At any rate I no longer "correct" others
when they "mis"pronounce it :)

Want another reason?  If your thesis is in computer science, as mine was, you 
might want it to be in the form of a "literate program", i.e. a source file 
that can be transformed by 2 different filter programs into a compilable 
program and a LaTeX script including (among possibly other things) a 
gorgeously prettyprinted version of the code.  That's what I did, using FWEB, 
one of several "literate programming" systems inspired by Donald Knuth's work; 
I used Emacs too, by the way.  And: it was accepted.
