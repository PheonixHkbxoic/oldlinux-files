Why has the loopback route a destination 127.0.0.1 instead of 127.0.0.0
in accordance with the specified netmask?
The loopback interface could have IP address 127.0.0.1 and connect to
a loopback network 127.0.0.0 with netmask 255.0.0.0 (conceptually)

About assigning the same IP address to multiple interfaces on the same
host:
One could argue that this is "correct" as long as the outer world cannot
see any difference. Consider all interfaces as one big specially designed
interface with the software (linux) hiding the differences. So, as long
as the software supports this concept it is correct IMHO.

NEXTSTEP is undeniably the finest operating system I have ever used.
The user interface is intelligently thought out, the operating system is
object oriented from the ground up, and the application development tools
were the first of their kind.  I have an original NeXT box on my desk
for doing day-to-day office tasks like mail, remote logins, word
processing and spreadsheets.  I also upgraded a while back with their
NeXTdimension color card, which increases my workspace by adding a color
monitor (better for graphics) next to the original monochrome (better for
text).  Operating System upgrades and Software installation are a snap.

As for memory requirements, 8 megs is too little, 16 enough for most work,
and 32 is perfect.  The 105 MB disks shipped with the newer workstations
was too small, but 330 MB can support the entire suite of development tools
and a few extras like Tetris.

One area where the NeXT's weren't too strong was add-on cards, a problem
surely remedied by the 486 port.  Unfortunately, only a limited number of
configurations are officially supported, and device drivers for special
cards are harder to come by.  I once hired a consultant to adapt a PC
ISA bus camera controller card to work in the NeXT, but it was expensive
and the prototype ended up being the only one ever built.  The driver was
also difficult, and required inside information from NeXT on how their
kernel worked.  Most people won't be in this situation, however.

Ironically, since our new project required a PC and a custom processing
card, Linux was suggested by a co-worker and presents a serious challenge
to NEXTSTEP.  It enjoys a rapidly widening user base and is at an exciting
time in its growth curve.  Although I'm no fan of X, Linux provides as
generic a software platform as can be had, and all sorts of software is
supported.  We also have quite a few in-house X applications that would
be nice to run without having to run an X server atop NeXT's Display
Postscript engine.

NeXT was light years ahead of the competition when they came out, and I
hope they stay aggressive for the future without letting the industry
standards overtake them.

I am running an HP DAT tape with Linux.  Can't comment on multiple backups
on 1 tape as I have not done it let.  I assume that the tar "append"
function will work properly as it does on my QIC tape which is also SCSI.

You will want to read the SCSI How-to information about creating device
driver files.  It is very easy and only takes a few minutes.

Good luck.

I just bought WORDPERFECT 6.0a for windows for $87 (competitive upgrade) and

The Mitsumi price came down to $200 Cnd$.  The Canadian dollar is worth

Yes, I know that all the limitations are due to the driver.  Under DOS/Windows
the Mitsumi can read anything.  I don't plan on using photo CDs in the near
future anyways.  By the time I need to use one maybe it will be supported.

I bought the Mitsumi yesterday.  Installed like a charm.  Kernel recompile was
simple as always.  I am listening to 'from the cradel' by Eric clapton with
WorkMan as I type this.  Very nice program by the way.

I got the Mitsumi because it is a bit cheaper here but more because the
Mitsumi's seek time (1/3 stroke) is 250ms and full stroke is 380ms.  The
Panasonic's 1/3 stroke is 380ms.  This is a big difference.  No, I didn't do
any side by side benchmarks on it, I'm going on spec sheets here.

Anyways, I am happy with my purchase and would like to thank all who offered
their advice.  If anyone needs to beta test new Mitsumi drivers, drop me a note
and I'll be happy to do some tiger testing.

Of course not - the NCR53c8xx series only come in surface mount

Not necessarily.  Many PCI systems include the NCR SDMS BIOS code
in the system BIOS, although they don't include the chip.  It would
be worthwhile doing a 

    strings /dev/mem | grep -i ncr

to see what your memory looks like.

>Who makes such beasts?  

If you need one with a BIOS chip, Nextor's model 93 is the only one I'm 
aware of, unless you want to go with an 825 based board (FAST+WIDE,
requires two minor patches to make it work under Linux).

If not, ASUS, Intel, Portland, and many others make non-BIOS
equipped boards.

>Second, the ASUS card is $100.  That is cheaper than many cheapo ISA
>cards.  

Actually, you can find non-BIOS versions of the boards for about
$70.  Given the fact that many BIOS vendors (ie, Intel) who lacked
NCR SDMS support for their boards have upgraded their newer ROM
images to included it, this _might_ be the way to go (some of 
the ROM vendors can't seem to get their act together,
and alternate between working and broken releases).  Also, any 
problems caused by flakey protected mode PCI BIOSes should be 
fixed if you upgrade.

The Nextor boards tend to run about $140ish.

>Does this mean it is programmed IO?  

Nope,  they're busmastering.  Architecturally, they're similar
to the Adaptec AIC-7770/7870 chips used on the 2xxx series, except they 
execute more complicated instructions from main memory rather than 
simpler ones from on-chip RAM, context switch in software rather than 
hardware, and have other minor differences.

>As of now, adaptec isn't an option for me because of their nondisclosure
>crap.  

Note that Adaptec doesn't have an NDA requirement on the hardware
docs as is generally believed, although there is one on the 
downloadable firmware's interface.

However, some of their tech support staff will lie to you about that fact and 
refuse to forward your calls to some one who knows what's going on. 

IMHO, that's still plenty of reason to avoid Adaptec. 

>Buslogic is an option, but they are expensive, and I want to see
>if they are worth three times the NCR price.  

The Linux Buslogic drivers are a bit more mature.  If you want top
performance from _multiple_ devices accessed at the same time
under Linux, right now instead of whenever I get arround to it (I need to
finish debugging the new save/restore pointers code so the right 
values get restored after a SCSI context switch) you'll be happier with 
the Buslogic boards.

People've had a lot of problems with the NCR boards, the
vast majority of which break down into general PCI configuration/bug
things.  I've seen the same sorts of reports in large numbers with
the Buslogic boards as well - you'll have it if you have broken 
PCI devices or a broken mainboard no matter what you use.
