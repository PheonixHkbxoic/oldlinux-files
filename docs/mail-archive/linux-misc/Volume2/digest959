Subject: Options for backups on laptops?
Date: 17 Oct 94 02:15:26 GMT


I am planning to buy a laptop. What options are there for attaching a
tape drive for taking backups under Linux?  I have searched high and
low through the FAQs and HOW-TOs but find no guidance in this area.

As I understand it, drives that connect to the parallel port are out
along with anything that might use a parallel to SCSI adaptor.

Is attaching a SCSI tape drive via a PCMCIA SCSI card a viable
option?  If so what drivers are available?

- Or should I be trying a completely different approach to backups
such as getting a 2nd hard disc?

I would be grateful for any suggestions and advice that you might have.

Can't you make an UMSDos filesystem on the floppies and use some of those 
UMStools I've seen for copying? Never tried it myself, but it looks as
if it *should* work...?

This is an urgent call for help, because I have probs to repair my

My system broke down (HD hangs, X down) and I had to reboot. After
that, e2fsck finds an error in my partition /dev/hdb1 (using e2fsck

"Block bitmap 0 for group 0 not in group"

All other partitions were mounted correctly. When I tried to fix the
problem with "e2fsck -v -r -b 8193 /dev/hdb1" and then mount the
partition, (other values like 16385 didn't worked either...)

"EXT2-fs error (device 3/65): ext2_check_descriptors:

Problem one. How exactly are you going to connect 100 terminals to a PC?
Terminal servers cost more than the machines themselves.

Putting serial lines on the PC will limit the number of terminal connections.
Bet on 32 ports per machine.

No you cannot. However a cheaply speced 386/486 can. And probably not even
double the price of a terminal.

-: Also, does anyone know

-: Last time I looked, a few

That's still in the right price range. Consider:

- Low end 486    $130
- 8 Meg RAM      $330
- ethernet card   $40
- Video card      $50
- Monitor        $115 (VGA monochrome. Cost sensitive here.)
- Floppy          $40
=====================
                 $705

This station could load Linux over the network and could support additional
terminals connected via a 4 port serial card (another $110). So you could have
an Xterminal and 4 dumb terminals in each group.

-: Also, what would you use for 
-: ports for that many terminals?

Serial ports - Few ports (4-16) . Needs a PC. cheap.
terminal servers - More ports (16-32). No PC needed. Expensive. 

That's about it.

I'm not so sure about these numbers. I have a 486-66 with 20 Megs of ram and
16 Meg of swap for student use. I've seen as mant as 23 people doing
simultaneous edits and compiles and the machine didn't even go into swap.
Linux's shared memory and buffer cache system is truly awesome.

Agreed. You may even wish to look into low end Xterminals and a few servers.
The servers won't need a keyboard or video system which can save quite a few
bucks.

Keep us posted. This is an interesting problem.

a UniLingual and a MultiLingal application, each which is different, as a
better way to attack the problem. This is my current inclination. However
I honestly don't know enough about the process to make a solid judgement 
on this.

Note that I'm adding the WYSIWYG and multilingual tags to the subject.
Anyone replying to this please change the tags to reflect the type of

so we can distinguish which application we're talking about.

But let's get beyond the lack of Multilingual support. It's needed. Linux
could be a leader in the area. Let talk about how to do it.

I finally got yggdrasil Fall '94 installed on my machine (thank's to the
erratta sheet!).  Now I'm having problems with X and the Mach64 card (ATI
GPT).  When I startx and the card goes into 1024x768 all I get is monitor
pops and fizzles; the image is there but it appears four times (ie. I get 4
screens; two on top and two on the bottom; if you move the mouse there are
four arrow cursors that move with it)...

Somebody told me to pick up the Mach64 X-server from sunsite.  This file is
dated 06/94 (quite a bit older than the fall '94 Yggdrasil package) and it
didn't make any difference anyway.

So what do I need to do to get my Nec3d/Mach64 combo working under X?  I've
tried different clock settings and toggling around with ctrl-alt-+/- but all
that gives me are different squealing sounds from the monitor...

Thanks...

I'm using the SoundBlaster SCSI-II card to control a CD-ROM and Syquest
removable drive.  All work well under Linux except that I've got to type the
following at the LILO boot: prompt:

    linux aha152x=0x340,11,7,1

Is there anyway of automating this?  I really hate to have to type all this
whenever I want to boot Linux.  BTW, the Yggdrasil manual says that you can
add an "append=" entry to your lilo.conf file; I did this but it still
doesn't recognize my SCSI card.

And while I'm on the topic, does anyone know how to setup LILO to accept
something shorter than "hda3" for the partition to boot?  I'd like to just
type "1" for example to boot DOS and "2" to boot Linux...

Also is there a way to change the default boot partition?  Right now if I
hit enter at the boot: prompt, it will boot /dev/hda1 (my Linux partition). 
What do I need to do to change this so that it boots a different partition
by default?

It's real tough to use anything less than 4 MB. The way to do it if it's
absolutely necessary is to get a kernel that doesn't build a RAMDISK, mount
the floppy, and create a swap partition/swap file as quickly as possible.

Well you can but it's really like kissing your sister. If you're not going to
actually install and use Linux on your system, then for now you'd be better
off using actual DOS.

How about you tell us about your system (CPU type and speed, RAM size, Disk
size and amount available) and then we could better help you determine how
to proceed.

If you're really working on SLS 1.02 then we desparately need to pull you from
what's essentially the Linux Dark Ages. Almost like reading Gutenburg ;-)

I noticed this also.  The file system rearrangement was sloppy. Some
scripts don't run without complaints about missing files and
directories. I was never sure whether there was a problem with the
CD-ROM install, my machine, or me. The Fall '94 is half-baked.   

I used the Fall '94 for a whole day - Columbus Day, which I had off.
Then, giving up on this possibly bogus product, I blew up the install
and went back to Summer '94, which, in my opinion, seems to be a better
quality package. Next time I go to my favorite UNIX reseller, Promox
Systems in Sunnyvale, I'm going to bitch about it.  I have two Linux
machines which were supposed to be Summer and Fall, respectively; at
this point, they're now both Summer '94.

Subject: Re: 540 MB drive problems, anyone?
Date: 16 Oct 1994 17:15:50 -0700

I have a Quantum LPS540AT IDE drive.  It has 1120 cyl, 16heads,
and 53 sectors.  I initially lied to the BIOS and said it only had
48 cyl.  I was able to use DOS fdisk to make a first partion of
48 cyl.  Then I used Linux fdisk and went into expert mode and changed
the number of cylinders to 1120.  Apparently, this trick is only good
for each time you run Linux fdisk, because it always comes up with
48 cyl initially.  I proceeded to make 3 Linux partitions.

LILO was not happy with this.  It wouldn't deal with the fact that
the first Linux partition was beyond what the BIOS said was the
end of the disk.

So, I went into my BIOS config and said the drive had 1023 cyl.
This did nothing to upset the DOS partition, as it still booted.
I went back to Linux and was then able to get LILO to install.

In conclusion, the trick for drives that have more than 1023 cyl
is to tell the BIOS there is only 1023.  Do your DOS partitioning
(if needed) and then when you set up Linux partitions, make sure the
one you plan to boot from is completely containted within the first
1023 cyl.  Use the expert mode in Linux fdisk to change the
number of cyl to what they are in reality and you can recover
all the the hard disk that you paid for.
