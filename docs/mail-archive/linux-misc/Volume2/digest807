I called Digiboard about there ISDN board and asked if they supported
Linux or FreeBSD.  They told that they didn't support either, so I them
why did not support and they told me they had seen the demand for it.
They where planning on a SCO driver.

So, I think everyone should, on principle, call Digiboard and tell them
that they want this support.

: and 0% for the upper 8 Meg, then your AVERAGE time for memory access is:

: lower 8 Meg: .10 * 70 + .9 * 15 = 20.5 ns
: upper 8 Meg: 1.0 * 70 + 0.0* 15 = 70 ns
: overall:                          45.25 ns

: cache RAM.

Your calculation is nice, but I do not believe that this is the real problem.
To give you an idea why I do not believe it:

I have here running several different PCs under Linux.
The main observation is: 
One of them has an old 486 board (25MHz) with no cache at all and it is very fast. 
There is no real difference to boards with large amounts of L2-cache.
BTW I do not think that the L2-cache is essential for an OS like Linux.
(I am not talking about DOS or doing number cranching under Linux ...).

The point I want to make clear is simply: 
I guess that the performance problems with caching only a part of you
main memory is more an organisational problem on your board than a problem
with 70 ns ...

I'd agree with this... I can really see WP saying 'Hey, lets code a version of

Well, you have to remember what you are buying when you get a software package.
A *license* to use it. This means that you are essentially buying the right to
use the software package on one or more machines (naturally, this depends on
the license. Normally you will pay more for a multi-user, often paying larger
amounts for larger number of users (although I do like SunSoft licensing of
Solaris, you have a 2 user license, or a multi-user license... multi-user being
as many users has the machine can support at one time. Doesn't cost much either
(*much* cheaper than SCOs license agreements)). So if you *did* return the
product, and asked for a *full* refund, you would be using the software without
a license, which is priacy. I guess you could ask if you could return the
media the package came on, and ask for a refund on that... but somehow I don't
think companies are going to let you do that. It would still be legal though, as
you still have a license to use the product.

As an aside, I know that Microsoft sells a license for their products, so you
can legally use a copy, although I think that they intended it to be used to
allow more people to use a legitimate copy of their software. It *is* cheaper
than buying a completely new package, as you don't have the media and manual
costs to pay.

Yep, I *used* to use WP, but when I got to this Unix box, I started to use
LaTex (I also used a package that let me convert WP files to LaTex format as a
stop gap (didn't like program code much at all) until I could learn LaTex
properly). I can now do everything I could do with the windows versions of
WP or Word, and in some cases, more (LaTex is *great* for maths :).

And in practice, people who route the loopback _host_, and people who
route the loopback _network_ seem evenly split.  Perversely, Mmy machine
_says_ it's routing the host, but any host on that net is loopback.  Go
figure...

This depends, as you say, on whether the IP kernel code can make it's
routing decisions based on interface name, rather than interface address.
I gather some can, and I gather it's a new thing.  Older (primarily
4.2/3BSD) code apparently couldn't.  I'm in the middle of rereading
Leffler & McKusick, I should have a better answer than that shortly.

Matt, don't be baited.  The poster is clearly clueless.  It is true that Unix
software tends to be hard to support, hard to find, and more expensive than
Windows or DOS-based counterparts.  But this isn't the decisive factor for a
lot of folks.

Again, I don't see how the stuff that's available for Linux can be compared
to what there is for Windows or DOS (not that this stuff is much good, ei-
ther - in fact, it's pretty funny how a lot of DOS software comes with manu-
als so incomplete and badly written that you have to go out and buy a book
guide just to figure out what is going on).  Personally, I prefer the Linux
on-line stuff, but that's not for everyone.

I'm not sure you can say that Linux multimedia support, or international-
ization, or many other things, are as good as what you'd find on a Mac or
under DOS/Windows.  I'm particularly cognizant of the fact that Linux has
no fully internationalized word processing, like what we find in MLS for
DOS, or NISUS for the Mac, etc.  But what is the point of Linux?  Is it
supposed to be another DOS?  Don't think so.  It's a traditional Unix
kernel for traditional Unix uses - software development, TCP/IP, file
servers, mail routers, etc.

If someone wants to do word processing, then Linux clearly isn't the first
choice.  TeX is an 80s-style typesetter.  Like looking at WordPerfect in
"reveal codes" mode :-).  Sure you can get WordPerfect for Linux, but this
isn't even the lead version (6.0).  Under Windows or on a Mac you just plug
in MS-Word or whatever and go.  And the Andrew editor, well, let's just say
that it is minimal - nothing like the systems you can get for DOS/Win/Mac.

Doesn't mean I'll trash my Linux partition, which has too many other uses.
I just don't know how, for example, anyone could choose DOS or Windows as
their development environment.

Linux and it's hardware support has been written by persons that use Linux
themself. And usually these persons (including me) write the drivers mainly
for fun. It's fun to write support just for hardware that I use
myself and for which there is sufficient documentation available. Writing
drivers for somebody else is not interesting at all as long as nobody pays
for doing that.

PS/2, MCA and Token Ring are technologies which are not used by persons
writing Linux so it's no surprise that they are not supported. The fact that
these technologies are widely used is not alone a sufficient reason to implement
support for them. However Linux is free OS which means than any user of
PS/2 or TokenRing has freedom to write the support (or to hire a ISA/ethernet
hacker to do it).

Oh yeah? What about SGIs superb graphics ? What about the fact that you 
can put 256MB RAM in them (and it works! (have you ever seen a PC 
with > 64MB?)) ? What about ECC checked memory ? What about a >200MB/sec bus ?
What if you want to develop code which runs then in parallel on SGI Challenges ? 
What if you want to have a *real* FORTRAN compiler ? What if you want to have 
perfect integration of AUDIO/VIDEO ? What if you want to use disk striping to get
transfer rates of > 20MB/sec ?

Remember that the Indigo is the low end of a rather big line of workstations. 
R4000SC is actually a processor which is already 2 years old and obsolete. 
The processor you should be comparing to is R4400@150Mhz which can be up 
to two times as fast depending on your code. And if you were using R8000
your floating point speed would be almost four times as fast (looking
at the SPEC FP92 numbers (Intel 815/100: ~80, PowerChallenge R8000: ~310).
