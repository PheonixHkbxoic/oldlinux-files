I am using rev .06 of BIOS right now...  Why should I upgrade?

Please help me out (and others, I'm sure) by posting what all of the changes 
(.08 and .10 I think) do differently than .06..  I heard something about a
PCI buffer being disabled.  My system with ATI GUP PCI, Q-Logic FastSCSI PCI,
5 other cards withg WinNT 3.1 and WFW 3.11 is ROCK solid.   Never a crash...

Thanks!

release of linux and was told that the X11R6 had incorporated it.  I can't seem 
to find it.  Xwin just uses the default TSENG 4000 configuration.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

Reply-To: root@maxwell.ping.de

Hello,

I want to use Linux on my Intel-P60-PCI PC. Therefore I want to buy
a 1GB HD and a CD-ROM-drive. Because of several reasons I want to use
SCSI but the PCI-board I use has NOT the NCR-chip on board.

Can anybody recommend a PCI-SCSI controller which can be used with
Linux or should I buy a controller for the AT-bus (e.g. Adapatec 1542cf) ?

Is a PCI-SCSI-controller much faster than an AT-bus-controller ?
When will the PCI-Adaptec be supported by Linux ?


Please send me Your reply by E-Mail.

                                        many thanks,

Yes, they do. I'm running an HP 35470 and a 1.2 GB harddisk on an Adaptec
1542B without any problems.

You can tar mutiple backups on one tape using the non-rewind device file
/dev/nst0 and mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf <number f archive on tape> for winding the tape to the appropriate place.

You don't need to get info on the ASP from creative - it's an off-the

that info up.....

As to the E-mu, you're right - they will NEVER release that info.  But 
who cares - get a SB16 and get the Roland SoundCanvas WaveBlaster-style 
daughterboard.  Works excellent.

This is not possible with the way the FTP protocol works (the server
does not listen on port 20, instead it connects from port 20 to a
different port picked by the client). To get FTP over term, you have
to compile an ftp client (e.g. ncftp) or an ftp server
(e.g. wuarchive-ftpd) with the termnet library.

there's literally a dozen places.  Universal CD-ROM on S. Bascom in

That's all I can think of right now.  Universial CD-ROM is probably the

I use the yabbs system on my machine.  It has bases for mail and a strong

Subject: Trouble with fdisk 1.5 on big disk
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 12:42:00 GMT

I am having trouble with fdisk (v1.5) when I try to create partitions on
my Micropolis 1924 (2.1GB). I am currently running Linux 1.1.51.

If I create the partitions under Linux then OS/2 complains with a 'disk
2 has a corrupted partition table', and fails to recognize the
partitions that I created. This means that if at that point I create a
new OS/2 partition, all my Linux partitions on that disk are gone. :-(

If I first create the partitions for OS/2 and then I go to Linux, fdisk
complains about partitions overlapping !!!

I only have problems with the 2.1GB drive which is at scsi id 1 (also
tried id 2 with the same results: I wanted to make sure that the disk
wasn't seen by the bios at bootup). At id 0 I have a Conner 540MB, which
worked without problems. Could the problem be related to the fact that
the disk has more than 1024 cylinders?

Another remark: if I create a primary partition with Linux's fdisk at
the beginning of the disk, it gives the warning that the logical and
physical start of the partition do no match. The problem does not occur
if I create the partition with OS/2.

A similar type of problem (physical vs. logical mismatch) appears when
creating big extended partitions, but as far as I can see, only if I
cross the 1024 cylinder boundary (see below).

I am including a (slightly edited) transcript of one of my sessions in
the hope that will help for troubleshooting.

Thank you in advance for any help you might give me. Am I doing
something really stupid?

Regards,

        Goncal

Subject: Linux v. OS/2 and Desqview - DOS multitasking
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994 21:58:44 GMT

Does anyone know how Linux compares with OS/2 and Desqview in terms of DOS multitasking (speed and crash protection - I'm aware of which DOS programs don't run under Linux yet).  I currently use OS/2, which is great, but something of a     sludge, and I'm looking to get into the freeware world.

Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks.
