You didn't tell me the name, but I guess you meant the ZyXEL-1.4* archive.

I've been playing with it about 10 mins now, and I can't get it to answer
the phone. I'm trying to configure the thing from remote though, so there
might be some errors at the console which I obviously can't see. :)

Are there any faq's available btw?

This is not true for all machines.  If you have a fast enough video card
and enough memory that X+Doom is not a burden, and not much else running,
the fact that you are using the accel functions of the card as opposed to
using it as a dumb frame buffer in DOS will offset the X overhead.  At
least it does on my system--Linux doom is faster and smoother on it than
under DOS.

Just buy a faster video card.  A DRAM s3 card ought to be enough.

Subject: Help! NCR 53c810 bootproblems after installing
Date: 9 Oct 1994 13:21:34 GMT

I use a Install bootdisk with an updated NCR boot image which works well.
When I installs Linux, I use custom disks ncr1 & ncr2. When these disks are installed I get
an error message wich tells me that there are maybe missing som files on the disks, but I chose to continue,
and everything seems to work well. (I know that the filesizes at the disk is a bit different than what
displays in ncrdisc1 & ncrdisc2, but i just asume that there's maybe an difference in the way that unix and dos counts bytes..)

Anyhow, in the setup I choose to not install scsi & ide files located in a1, but instead i select ncr later on.

When setup makes a bootup floppy, it seems to take to short time to make it, and it will not work when i try to boot on it either. 
If I include scsi or ide support from disk a1, then the bootdisk that setup makes will boot, but the system will not be able to connect
to my scsi drives.

My conclusion is that i either do something wrong, or that i am missing som files. Anyone that can give me som help here?

Hi to all!

Does anybody has an idea how to setup a second (Mono) Monitor to use under X11 with a normal SVGA
Monitor. I have a Mono Graphics Adapter and a Tseng ET4000, and I want to use both at the

I use XF86_SVGA X11R6. I know a friend of mine did this a few month ago, but he lost his

Anyone any sloutions, suggestions ?

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) that's

I think if everyone beta tested every piece of software to come out,
no one would every get any work done.  We all select the stuff that
is most important to us, and try to help out as best we can.  I'm
currently working hard to help get kinks out of DOSEMU, which I think
is a worthwhile project.  It takes a lot of time, and I have to weed
through a lot of debugging output and ftp patches every couple of days
(plus the ones the authors want me to try out).

I simply could not do this for every piece of software.

I'm honestly not sure on this one, but I seem to recalll there being a 
patch bandied about thats needed for this particular controlelr to run 
two drives?? (Someone with more experience with Adpatecs feel free to jump 
in.)  I don't have any experiene with this aprticualr conmtroller, I'm 
afraid. So I can't be too much help here.  Its certainly possible that 
there are dfifferent versions of the kernel on your different 
distributions.  Which Yygdrasil are you running?  The latest (fall94) has 
a dos-callback fallback that should get you up and runing no matter what, 
if DOS can see your drives.  Its not recommended as a permenant solution 
due to speed issues (thunking and droping to BIOS is slow) BUT it shoudl 
get you up so you cn apply patches where necessary....

Hmm.  I find 10 minutes somewhat insignificant in terms of the time it 
takes me to copy files, etc.
To a degree, this is the 'comfort' v. 'sportiness' factor mentioedn by 
the Linux Journel.  By making assumptions about what you want to do in 
the general case, it eases the use by inexperienced people at the expense 
of some speed.  If you really iknwo what you are doing and don't need 
this stuff, you can always log in as root and only run the scripts you 
need. (Not thatI recommend this.  Personally, if you don't want the 
comfort level then yes, buy the sportscar! ;)  )

Most people have no idea what is required in an X window system.  Again, 
Ild say you are lookign for sport performance out of a sedan.  Myself, I 
just delete stuff i don't need as I need the room.  It works for me.

Huh?  Autodetect?  MY fall94 xinit runs a script that specificly asks me 
what mouse I'm using.  (There WAS a script problem in Summer94 specificly 
with the ps/2 mouse, but it was fixed in Fall94).  This does not sound 
ANYTHING like the Yygdrasil I have (either Summer94 OR fall94).  If we 
ARE runni9gn the same version,l can only assume you didn't follow the 
directions, since I did and got totally different behavior.

Not for you.  I think how ever you have proved your earlier 'hard-on' 
point quite nicely.  Ok.  it isn't specificly what you want/need, that 
hardly makes it the anti-christ. It WAS exactly what i wanted/needed as 
a busy software engineer without a lot of time to fiddle with my home 
installation.

With flexability comes choices, and a need for greater knowledge. Again, 
we are talkign about differen't products for different kinds of users.
Myself, I have the knowledge, but not the TIME to go through a whoel host 
of choices. For me, easy, automated, and complete was alot more 
important then a high degree of flexability on teh install.  I can 
perfectly capable and happy to strip stuff later as the need arises.  
(FRankly, i have SO much room left over on my 300meg SCSI so far, that 
I don't expect to have to do that for quite awhile.  'Course I didn't 
install EVERYTHING I coudl fomr Yygdrasil, just the deleopment and 
system stuff 'cause thats all I intedn to do with my machine.  That was 
enough install flexabiltiy for me.)

Funny thing is, I (and Yygdrasil 's docs) kind of agree with you.  The 
cd-rom links serve 2 (and only 2 purposes).  
1: To allow people to get a peek at what UNIX is about (admittedly 
slowly) before doing the install. As you say, for 'curiousity'.
2: To allow access to uninstalled packages to 'look them over'.  I find 
this extreamly valuable.  I can run a toll first to see what it does, and 
then do an install_package on it if I want it.

By the way, the hoops you have to jump through to 'get rid of that damn 
cd-rom' are:
        umount /dev/system_cd
And it all goes away.

I have a feeling that, if you are that unhappy, and you bought it 
directly from yygdrasil theyw ill probobly refund your money.  Note that 
I don't work for them, and certainly don't speak with them, but I've 
found them to be genuinely (if a bit ineptly) concerned abotu their users.
Have you called them and asked?  (Don't give me that 900 number nonsense,

Frankly, i don't thin kyou should.  Your particualr list of problems have 
amde me fully understand what the author in the Linux JOurnal meant by 
his charcterization of yygdrasil v. Slackware.  It sure soudsn to me like 
you are the wrong audience for Yygdrasil, an the right one for 
Slackware.  Stick to what works for you.

I didn't intend  to attack you for your negative experiences.  I'm

Actually it does.  We have produced, IMO, finally some good solid points 
on why the Yygdrasil releas emight be wrong (or right) for someone.  Same 
thign for Slackware, though less so, since I don't have your experience 
with that particualr release.

I give up. Why didn't YOU?

This is kind of childish debate tactics (here comes the return-flame..)
Paul, and beneath your otherwise very intellegent comments above. Lets try
to respect each others intelligences as computer professionals, shall we? 


[P.S.  To all. Paul is right in a sense.  I think our discussion has 
produced some good, solid comments on why the various releases might or 
might not be good for a specific person, but beyond this its probobly 
pointless.  Unless Paul brings up more specific comments on the merits of 
the Yygdrasil release that I think really need another person's 
perspective to balance, Ill kill this thread in public.  Thanks for your 
patience.]
