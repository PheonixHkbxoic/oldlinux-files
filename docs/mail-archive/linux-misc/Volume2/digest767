Well the original poster asked for benchmarks...  It's the only one that I 
found covered within the linux doc realm.  I agree; it isn't worth much...

Perhaps the original poster has accumulated enough info to construct a 
Linux-benchmark-HOWTO?  (Ways to meaningfully bench Linux under differing 
hardware, ways to compare Linux boxes to suns, Ibms, SCOs, etc.)
I am not knowledeable enough to write such a HOWTO, but would gladly edit it...

   I'm sorry you feel that way.  But your posting was simply inaccurate
   regarding the issue of interface copyright.  It is a fact that Stallman
   stomped on a source distribution of PGP that merely contained #ifdef's
   so that it could be potentially linked with the gmp library, which was
   protected by the GPL.  Sure, Stallman and the FSF couched it in very
   legalistic terms, and then justified the means with the ends ("Free
   Software is Good, so what we did is O.K.").  But that's not any
   different from what Lotus did when they tried to use Copyright to
   protect their user interface.  It was the same sort of legal mumbo-jumbo
   that led to the same sort of result --- a restriction of who can write
   independent programs that implement or use a particular interface,
   whether that be a UI or an API.

   I am very saddened by the FSF's decision to use this very broad
   interpretation of the GPL.  I engaged in several e-mail messages
   debating this issue with Stallman, over a year ago, when the PGP/gmp
   issue came up, and he would not be moved.  He believes he is right, and
   he is entitled to that belief.

   However, my sadness does not extend to trying to ignore the situation
   for what it is.  I will not sweep this situation under the rug.  People
   are entitled to know *all* of the issues of the GPL, both its good side
   and its shadow side.

   [...]

   I believe the cause of free software is best furthered by putting the
   truth --- the whole truth --- on the table, and letting the chips fall
   where they may.

Your "cause" would be more persuasive if you'd post truths such as
these:

-  The FSF has explicitly renounced interfaced copyrights, including
   (specifically) on gmp

-  The existence of #ifdef's in the source distribution of PGP to
   which you refer did _not_ constitute the copying of an interface,
   nor did the FSF ever claim it did

-  It is thus perfectly safe and legal to write a body of code that
   copies the _interface_ of gmp but is not GPL'ed (e.g. is public
   domain, proprietary, or whatever) -- in fact, I believe this has
   been done

-  The gmp case bears almost _no_ legal resemblance to the Lotus 1-2-3
   look-and-feel copyright suit, despite your claims to the contrary --
   the only similarity I can see arises when people like yourself
   call the gmp situation a case of "interface copyright", which it
   is emphatically _not_ -- it is an interesting case of defining
   "distribution" as referred to by the GPL, which has no parallel
   in 1-2-3, which itself was a case of copying the interface but
   not the code, which in turn has no parallel in the gmp situation

-  It has been shown that if the FSF did not take the legal stance
   they did regarding gmp, it would be fairly trivial for anyone
   to write and sell proprietary (source-unavailable) software
   that included GPL'ed code (by having the user do the link),
   thus defeating one of the main purposes of the GPL -- for example,
   GNU Objective-C compilers would almost certainly not be available
   with source code, and it is quite likely that most other versions
   of GNU compilers, EMACS, and so on would be source-unavailable
   (or at least not freely redistributable)

That having been said, although I believe I understand the
situation well enough and agree with the FSF's stance, it is
obvious to me that many people do not understand it or, in
any case, come to a different conclusion.

However, it is deceiving to claim to state "the whole truth"
while the above points are omitted from the discussion.

Rather than engage in further debating of the above points, which
I've done in the past, I'll leave it to people genuinely interested
in the issue to consult the FSF, to read archives, and, best yet,
consult an intellectual-property lawyer (and make sure you give the
the _full_ story, not the loaded "summaries" often used by some people,
or you'll be wasting your $$).

Anyway, Ian Jackson's original post still stands, and as far as I
can recall, it was basically fully accurate.  I for one will be
donating GNU Fortran, the result of about 3 years of full-time
work (over a period of five years or so), to the FSF, which means
I will not own the copyright to it, the FSF will.  Thus they get
to decide how to interpret the GPL for it.  It is not the case that
I believe they will always do so perfectly -- it is simply the fact
that they will do a better job than I will, because unlike most or
all of the "FSF-claims-interface-copyright" claimants, they actually
pay a lawyer to tell them what the deal is -- something I don't
want to bother with.  Lawyers aren't always right, of course, but
I don't want to have to hire any.  (Hmm, I wonder what Linus would
do if companies started releasing proprietary, source-unavailable
versions of Linux using the kind of subterfuge the FSF would
attack in court if used on software to which the FSF holds the
copyright?)

But as his post urges, I urge developers to devote a reasonable
amount of time and effort to research and choose a licensing
method for your software, and make it clear which one you choose.
And just as a good developer shouldn't assume writing all the
code from scratch is the best way, nor should one assume that
creating a license method from scratch is best.  Look around for
various schemes, find out how they have and have not worked for
popular and unpopular software using them, and only then make your
decision.  The GPL is only one choice, there are many others.
There also are many different ideas people have for what the
word "free" means vis-a-vis software, so it would help if you'd
summarize your meaning if different from the GPL meaning, the
PD meaning, or whatever.  (The GPL meaning is described in the
text of the GPL itself.)

look, if the electric feild is move at near C, then if the wire is on a
downhill slope, then the e-field is accelerated past light speed, throwing
you into a time-warp into the past, so you here the sound later (in the real
present)

Well, it's not completely trivial to set up, but not anything beyond most

I suppose this IS true, although I would think you could put the same 
kind of dsiclaimer on a PD about suitability of purpose as you coudl ona  
liscensed product.

To my mind a BIGGER issue is that, when you PD something, anyone can do 
ANYTHING with your work-- including using it in ways or for purposes you 
did not intend and don't want to see.

If you want to make things freely available, my sugegstion is to GPL 
them.  FSF has put alot of time and effort (and legal fees) into coming 
up with a contract that allows free distribution and use, but lets them 
retain a degree of control.

I won't disagree with you tah the PDP was a fairly ncie machien for its 
time.  I WILL disagree with you, and give away my age, by sayign that I 
worked on some of the early LSI-11 Unices, and they were better thought 
out, and thus mroe intrinsicly pwoerful system then the OS9 version I 
worked with (CD-RTOS).

It also had signifcantly better development tools. (Like a non-broken

Hi (Again) All,

Are there Any patchs for Xfree86 (Am i correct in assumeing that it will work under normal Linux?) to get the Vision864 Chipset to work,even in only SVGA mode ? 

Or more importantly are they going to be supported in the next XFree Release ??

Email replies please,its pretty urgent :)

Cheers
Mike
