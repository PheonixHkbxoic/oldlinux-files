looking for a compiled version of gcc 2.6.0 for linux. Does anyone know
where to get it. Its not on sunsite or tsx11. If its on one of these
let me know or let me know where I can get it.

Get the new SVGA server from sunsite or elsewhere.  It -says- it's for Xfree
3.1, but it works wonderful with 2.1.1 after a little bit of minor configuring.

Drop me a line if you need help setting this up; I've got a shar archive of 
some man pages and a pre-typed mail message that I can forward you (in case
you can't tell, I've helped a few people w/the new 320x200 SVGA server, so 
don't hesitate to drop me a line).

Subject: Turtle Beach Maui (soundcard)/ICS WaveFront support under Linux?
Date: 12 Oct 1994 01:36:53 -0400


I was wondering whether the ICS WaveFront sampler/synthesizer chipset of the 
Turtle Beach Maui soundcard (and some other Turtle Beach soundcards) will be 
supported under Linux (it was not listed as a supported card in the Sound-HOWTO
from tsx-11).  I do not yet own a Maui soundcard, but I am aware that there is 
a "WavePatch" program that allows full control of the WaveFront chipset under 
MS Windows.  I was wondering whether or not a similar program/driver would be 
available for Linux, or do I have to go find my Microsoft Windows installation 
disks ... yuk!  8)

Thanks for any information.

I suspect you haven't looked at 387 prices lately.  An Intel chip
runs about $40, and I've seen Cyrix for $30 :)

I've also seen 486DLC/40 motherboards for about $110 (that's w/ just
VLB).  So figure $150 for 486DLC40+387/40.  Of course, for only $100
more, you can get a DX2/66 with VLB :)

   It's pretty easy. You will need to do a kernel rebuild, but that's not to
hard. With the older kernels, there is a line to uncomment in configuration 
file that allows the EtherExpress to be chosen. Do a 'make config' once the 
file is changed. If you choose to update to the newest kernel (I would, I 
used the EtherExpress with the old kernel for quite a while and had some  
problems - once I updated to the newest kernel, they all went away), then
just answer "yes" to the alpha drivers question. If you go for the the kernel
update, see the NET-2 HOWTO. It has the best explanation of where to find 
everything, and it also talks about network software updates.
   Feel free to e-mail me for more details. I went through this whole process
myself and lived to tell the story!

Having been an Ultrix administrator for some years, and run Linux for a
very short time and now a FreeBSD developer, I can say with certainty
that Linux is *nothing* like Ultrix when compared to FreeBSD.  FreeBSD
is orders of magnitude closer to Ultrix than Linux will ever be.  Some
would argue that it's not necessarily a good thing. :-)

Set BSD for what?

Nope.  Ultrix is probably the last of the commercial OS that is still
primarily BSD based (excepting BSDI's offering).  However, it's being
phased out by OSF/1, so it's a dead-end OS as far as DEC is concerned.

        I'm glad to hear that you think the problem is not
Yggdrasil-specific.  We can't reproduce this guy's problem, but
because it looks like a it would be useful in other contexts,
I've changed TBUFSIZ to 4096 in our source tree for the next

at 40 Mhz with a TI 486DLC-40 chip on it.

I suppose you allready have an SCSI-Adapter? If not, you will have to
get a Supported one (well, most are supported), recompile the kernel and
go on. Be shure to have a cartridge in the drive on boot-up. Besides
that, everything should be ok, Linux recognizes it as a simple harddisk.

As far as I can tell the mitsumis, atleast the old ones don't support
independant volume control, so the balance control will probably always
be broken. As for the know control codes, the only two settings that
seem to work are zero or full volume...

If like me your cd leaves the machine for a sound card (eg SB pro), you
can do like I did and redirect the mitsumi volume control ioctls to the
sound driver mixer controls. With this WorkMan works fine. I don't have the
patches for any recent kernel, but it is pretty easy to do. just redirect
the volume ioctl in the cdrom driver to to bottom of the mixer ioctl of the
sound driver.
