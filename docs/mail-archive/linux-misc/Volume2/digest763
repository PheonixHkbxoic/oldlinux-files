                   as an 'additional restriction' on distribution as the GPL
                   requires there are none. If it does (as my legal info says)
                   then you can't mix BSD with GPL and distribute the result.
                   If it doesn't can I therefore sell software GPL'd but with
                   a documentation requirement of must come with this expensive
                   booklet I've written ?

In the United States, the anwser is that there is apparently no
problem, because the BSD credit requirement is not thought to be
legally enforceable by most attorneys.  However, this is possibly not
the case in other countries (notably, the UK).

It *is* an additional restriction (if legally binding) and it does
pose a problem.  Given the good will of Berkeley, while it's a problem
that needs to be addressed (and rms is looking into various ways of
doing so); nobody is going to get sued on either side.

People might think that the GPL should make a special exception for
this.  (I did at first.)  But actually, the Berkeley requirement (if
enforceable) really is inimical to the GPL.  Imagine the situation
after twenty--or a hundred--people have added their own credit
requirements.  It would become essentially impossible to advertise GNU
software at all.

           -    How do inline functions in include files related to the GPL

GPL: If the inline functions are big/complex enough to make the result
a derived work, then the GPL applies as a whole to the resulting work.
The meanings of "big" and "complex" are undecided by the law at this
point.

LGPL: The same thing applies, except that the LGPL (*not* the GPL)
excludes from worry functions less than ten lines long, whether or not
they cause derivative status.

           -    What about structures from include files

Again, this depends on what the courts say is a "derived work".  It
seems likely that use of data structure layouts does not constitute
derivation, at the very least, if you compile without symbols.

With the LGPL, there is a special exemption for data structure layouts.

           -    When is a dynamic link a dynamic link 

The FSF's legal documents never use this term, so it's definition
doesn't matter.

           -    Interface issues. If I build a system that can use an LGPL
                   shared library I don't have to give a damn about the LGPL -
                   It hasn't got any gnu code in it and if people choose to
                   plug the two together its up to them.

If you distribute .o files (but not fully linked executables) which
only include data structure layouts and short (< 10 lines) functions
from header files, then you are on safe ground, with an LGPL'd
library.

Indeed, it may be necessary to address these issues in a broad way.
However, it becomes easy to paint yourself into a corner by specifying legal
interpretations for each and every techinical convention.  It is easy
to see why the FSF has avoided this level of detail.

The examples you cite are specific to the C/object-module
world.  These terms don't apply so well to reflective development environments.

Developers should be able to tune the L/GPL to their personal intent, making
minor exceptions just as the FSF does.  I think the way to do this is with
explicit agreements with users.

For UNIX, I can't help you, however there is Ms_DOS source code around 
pretty freely.  For that, you can get a copy of The Virtual REality

Thanks for the note on the Berne Convention. I won't even begin to try to 
dispute your obviously superior knowledge of international Copyright.

Implicit copyright in the US, however, has been a reality since at least 
the mid 80's.  It came in with the last revision of the US Copyright code.

But once you've heard the sounds that DOOM produces, you don't want to

Simple.  My machine at home runs Linux.  My machine in the office runs DOS.  
The Linux box isn't networked, while the DOS box is.  Which means I end up 
carrying piles and piles of floppies around whenever I need something at 
home off the Internet.  Being able to use ext2 on those floppies (or a 
UMSDOS driver for DOS) would simplify things a LOT.

Look for the NET2 FAQ. It covers SLIP pretty extensively. I've read it

NOTE: FOLLOWUPS SET TO alt.config

Since the Linux version of iD Software's game DOOM! was recently
released, the comp.os.linux.misc and comp.os.linux.help groups have
been inundated with questions about Linux DOOM!.  On the other hand,
people seem hesitant to take Linux-specific questions to
alt.games.doom, probably since most people reading that group are
unfamiliar with Linux, and since the S/N ratio in that group is rather
low.

Hence this is a formal proposal to create alt.games.doom.linux.  As by
Altnet guidelines, this is presented for discussion in alt.config
ONLY.

I don't really feel that all the HOWTO's et al are appropriate
for news.answers.  Once comp.os.linux.answers is created, that
should be used exclusively.  Sites like me expire *.answers for

I don't agree at all. I had Linux on a 386DX40 with 8 meg & normal
video and when I upgraded to 486-66 with 16 meg & VESA I was even a
bit disappointed that the FEEL of using Linux - under X Windows - did
not change very much. Of course programs that took a long time on the
386 were *much* faster on the 486, but starting utilities, compiling
*short* programs & stuff like that, really went smooth already on
the 386.

So unles you want to bend your machine under heavy work, the 386/40
with 8 meg should be more than sufficient.

Paai.

If you have access to WWW, you could look at

you'll find a lot of info on Linux on a Thinkpad 750;
it also tells you that there is a Slackware 2.0 compatible bootdisk at 
ftp://peipa.essex.ac.uk/pub/tp750/tp-bare.gz

Hope this helped,

Help. I have installed the latest Slackware distributions (from sunsite) of
XFree and XView. Everything is OK for XFree but my OPENLOOK ie Xview can't
find the proper fonts. It is looking for -b$h-lucidia........ fonts. I've
checked the fonts.alias files and have noticed that these fonts are already
aliased in the 75dpi directory. But still, all XView applications, including
olvwm (grrrrr) crash because they can't find there fonts. I've done mkfontsdir a
nd xset fp rehash and all that stuff but to no avail.

I noticed that the xview and olvwm .rc files use a shell variable called
$OPENWINHOME. And all menu and font etc references are loaded in relation to
this. I've looked and looked, but can't find where is var. is set.

Is it a Xresource ?
Where can I set this ?
Whats up with the fonts ?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Porting should not be too hard. I have been working on a port

There it works, although I have not had too much chance to test it

Subject: __IO_stderr_ undefined linking libX11
Date: Thu, 15 Sep 1994 14:57:03 GMT

when compiling and linking a program that uses X11 functions, the linker
reports that some modules in the X11 lib reference symbol __IO_stderr_
The question is simple: what is it, and were is it defined?
(My 'solution' of defining a global FILE * __IO_stderr_ = stderr ; works,
but is a wild guess: if no actual reference to __IO_stderr_ is ever made
while the program is running I wouldn't know if my guess was wrong)

anyone?

Michel.

* This is no X11 question: i never get that linker error on our sun
