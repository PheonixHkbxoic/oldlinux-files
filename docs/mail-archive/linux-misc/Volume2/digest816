The options available in a window manager can sometimes make a difference. I
could see why clicking on a window with the left button to change the
keyboard focus might also clear the copy-buffer. The window manager would
do two things with that click: change the focus, (possibly raise it too), and
then try to highlight a null-size copy area which clears your copy-buffer.
According to the olwm man page:
"You can set the input focus to a window and simultaneously raise it to the
 top by clicking the left mouse button in the window's title bar or border.
 Olwm has another focus mode called "focus-follows-mouse." In 
 this mode, whatever window the mouse is pointing to will receive
 the input focus. To switch the input focus from one window to
 another, you simply move the pointer to the other window; you
 don't have to click at all."

They state rather specifically that it has to be the title bar or
border, not within the drawing window. You might also want to play with
a different focus mechanism. Try the following resource:
olwm*SetInput: followmouse

I use mwm and prefer the pointer/followmouse mechanism over the point-and-click
method. You might too. I know that you place resources for mwm in .Xdefaults;
I'm not sure where the best place is for them for olwm.

Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 22:22:43 GMT

I'd really like to know why does Linux DOOM run significantly slower
on Linux than it does on DOS for the same machine.  Is it because it
has to go through multiple layers of X and Linux?  I've also played it
on a SGI workstation, where it is reasonably fast.  Of course, the
machine also had a 150 MHz MIPS processor.  Is there any way to
make doom run faster on Linux besides getting a faster machine?

Good idea Randy.  Let me point out that Linux Journal currently has a
Consultants Directory in it.  This can be a source of people for you to
contact as well as its primary purpose: showing people where to find Linux
consulting.

The primary advantage of the listing in LJ is that it reaches a lot of
people who are not on the Internet and are thus more likely to need
hand-holding.  For those out there doing consulting, your initial listing
in LJ is free, then it costs $150/year (which about 1/2 covers our actual
cost but weeds out the "list me for the hell of it" from people who are
serious).

: Are there IP addresses set aside for standalone LANs?  Where are they

Okay, I have two suggestions... In ``TCP/IP Network Administration''
by ORA, it says that the address with a first byte "Greater than 223,
indicates the address is reserved.  We can ignore these reserved
addresses".  You shouldn't find people using those addresses on the
Internet, so I guess you could use address then 224.0.0.x for your own
LAN.

My other suggestion is to register your own Class C Network with
InterNIC, who will assign you your own IP numbers.  It doesn't cost
anything, and if you planning to eventually connect your LAN to the
Internet it might be worth looking into.  I *think* you can pick up
the form from internic.net somewhere, but I don't remember where.
See what you think.

I'm using the HP `JetStore 2000', Kernel 1.0.0, Adaptec 1742. No

results ranging from the P5-90 sticker to the Neptune chipset. Needless 
to say I cancelled my order. Royal promised I'd have the system in 7 days 
and I did. I should point out that a friend of mine ordered a system from 
a third vendor, and his system was delayed a week. 
BTW, my CPU (a Pentium 90) has a fan right on it. What's the problem with 
not having heatsink compound?
