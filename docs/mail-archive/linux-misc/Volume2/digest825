At present, no.  Evidently trumpet cheats a little, and either
doesn't get all the information it needs or stores it between
runs and updates it when you're busy doing something else (such
as reading an article).  This data includes information such as
moderation status of a group, and can only be obtained by getting
a copy of the active file.  Wayne Davison, author of trn, is
working on extending to NNTP protocol to make it SLIP friendly;
mail him if you'd like to beta test trn 3.6.  It will require
changes to the NNTP server, though, so you'll need cooperation at
that end.

I can't speak for the Linux being able to support token ring (I 
haven't been using it for very long) but there is no problem in
using Netware & IP on the same network, provided that you are using
Netware v3x or v4x (no IP support on Netware v2x).

If Linux doesn't support TR, you're still OK, because your Netware
server will act as an IP router (see above).  Just put a supported
ethernet board in the Linux box, put on in the Netware server, and
enable IP (load the TCPIP.NLM, with the option forward=yes).  You
will need some extra memory in the server (TCPIP.NLM also loads
SNMP.NLM, STREAMS, CLIB, TLI, IPXS, AFTER311) so be sure that you 
have enough memory to support it (about an additional 2MB).  
You will also (probably) want to increase the minimum an maximum packet 
receive buffers if you are using v3.11.  If you are on 3.12 or 4.x, 
you should be OK.

You should be aware that your Netware server will act as an IP router
out of the box, but that's it.  If you want to do files sharing or
printing you will need to buy extra stuff.

If you have any other questions, feel free to email me.

Although I doubt this is your problem, try escape/ignore 17 and 19 anyway.
I ran linecheck and nothing out of the ordinary was printed. But term just
wouldn't work. Seemed that the XON/XOFF between the modems was kicking in
with large packets only and linecheck doesn't seem to use large packets so
it only died when it was working hard.

Hi all,

I am new to using Linux and I was wondering what editors/wordprocessors
exists. The ones I know about (came with the Slackware distribution) are
Emacs (several variants), TeX (lots of different macros), Jove, ed and elvis.
I have also invested in Crsip (not working yet).

This is a request for opinions, not arguements, directions on how to get
something, nor am I asking for a guide to the use of a particular piece of
software. All I really want is a list of all the packages that run under
Linux so I can make a choice.

Well, for a while, I was running non parity simms in a 386 that can't disable

I had similar problems with my CD-ROM drive.  I solved it by using my Yggdrasil 
CD as a coaster and bought a the SLS distribution CD from TransAmeritech.  I 
have not had a SINGLE PROBLEM with it.  It installed right out of the box and 
all I had to do was follow the directions (however minimal)

I would suggest also the "Linux Bible; The GNU testament" from Yggdrasil 
though.

   From: Prabhat Keni <pkeni@rahul.net>
   Date: Sun, 25 Sep 1994 21:12:36 GMT

   I have Adaptec 1542CF and only a Toshiba 3401b on it. I have enabled
   sync negotiation and fast scsi options on this one. 

   1) Has anyone gotten transfer rates of 10 Mb/s on similar hardware ?
   2) Is it normal for ASPI4DOS to take more time for 10 Mb/s while loading.
   i.e. should I wait a little longer, at the risk of hard disk corruption ?
   3) Is there any benchmarking stuff for cd-rom performance in 
   public domain/shareware/copy lefted s/w.
   4) Am I missing something ?

I have a Tosh 3401 on an Adaptec 1742 along with some other devices, and
formerly used it on this same MB.  (Dallas summertime + bad air conditioning
cooked it, alas.)  Anyway, I initially set it to 10 mb/s.  This was too
greedy.  I experienced occasional flakiness -- no error messages, but bad
data read from the disk once a week or so.

I cut it back to 6.67 mb/sec and have had no more problems.  I have since
read that the passive termination provided free on the devices is not good
enough for reliable operation at 10 mb/s -- this was the problem in
my case.  The 1742 (and I believe also the 1542) have active termination,
but you need it on both ends.

A CDROM puts out about 300k/sec, though it bursts faster than that.
You're losing absolutely nothing by running the scsi bus at 5.

There are CDROM benchmarks for DOS on simtel somewhere (big help, I know).
DOS is probably best, you get the raw number, unmodified by OS speedups or
slowdowns.

I have no idea why ASPI4DOS would hang, but if you really want to work
on it, I'd start with the termination and cabling.  If there are no
disks on the SCSI bus, it's most unlikely that you could get disk
corruption.  The MB does work at 10 meg/sec, if the scsi bus itself can.
I think I used to get something in the 8000's of k/sec from CORETEST,
which basically measures the transfer rate from the buffer on the disk.

Subject: SLIP problems solved and some tips offered
Date: 26 Sep 1994 00:33:32 GMT

Hi, there,

I posted some questions regarding the setup of SLIP (with dynamic IP address
assignment) using dip a few days
ago. Thanks to a lot of friends on the network, the 
problems are solved. Since I also got several requests for the same problems,
I'd like to summarize some important tips for those who are still 
struggling with their SLIP setups.  I think for those who use the terminal
servers with static IP address assignment, the setup is quite simple (just
get the sample script file and make some modifications). So, here, only the
 case of dynamic IP address assignment is concerned. 
To my knowledge, there are two kinds of 
servers: one automatically (or by some commands) shows the IP address when 
you dial in.
The other one uses BOOTP to send the IP address to the local systems (I believe
most servers can also show IP address by some command, such as, 
"show port alt ip char" on Xyplex terminal servers, though). For those who
use the first kind of servers, you can use the command "get $locip remote"
(Note: not "get $rmtip remote") to capture the address, 
or if the IP address is not shown automatically, you
should figure out what is the command to let the server show the address
(you may need to ask the server managers since sometimes, the command
is not that straightforward). For those who use the second type of servers
(I mean  the servers not willing to show the address except through BOOTP).
you may need the package of bootpc.v031.tgz at

Since I didn't do this, I don't know the details about using BOOTP. 

For servers which can somehow show the IP address, the following tips
 may be helpful to setup SLIP.

1. Give a name as the hostname of your local system and
   setup the domain name, such as tamu.edu in my case, for your local system.
2. Put a name server in /etc/resolve.conf. You can take a look at some 
   existing systems in network for the format.
3. For easier debugging, you can use interactive mode by "dip -t" and "term" to
   login to your terminal server and try the commands you want to put in your
   dip script.
4. For those who use modems which need atdt as dial prefix, put an extra
   "t" before the phone number since current dip uses atd as the prefix (you 
   need to make sure about your dip, though).
5. According to my experience, using "\r" at the end of command lines you send
   to remote server is better than using "\n". I don't know why.

The above procedures are very effective for me. I am not sure they are the
same for you, but at least you can try.
The following is my script used for a Xyplex server.


       main:
         get $local jenny
         get $remote 128.194.24.175

         # Set the desired serial port and speed.
         port /dev/cua2
         speed 38400
          reset

         # Prepare for dialing.
       #  send ATQ0V1E1X1
         dial t845-1420
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         wait CONNECT 60
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error

         # We are connected.  Login to the system.
       login:
         send \r\r
         wait name> 4
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         send <your userID>\r 
         wait word> 4
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         send <passwd>\r
         wait  Choice: 4
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         send 1\r
       loggedin:

         # Set up the SLIP operating parameters.
         get $mtu 1006 #you can put something less
         # Set Destination net/address as type 'default' (vice an address).
         # This is used by the 'route' command to set the kernel routing table.
         # Some machines seem to require this be done for SLIP to work properly.

         # Say hello and fire up!
       done:
         wait Xyplex>  4
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         send show port alt ip char\r
         wait Address: 10
         get $locip remote 10
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         wait Address: 10
         get $locip remote 10
         if $errlvl != 0 goto error
         default
         print CONNECTED to eeslip local at $locip
         send set port internet slip enable\r
         mode SLIP
         goto exit
       error:
         print SLIP to $remote failed.
       err: 
         print I am here.
       exit:

Which distributors would you recommend for Linux.  Downloading is not fun.  
Any horror stories?  Should I pick one at random?
