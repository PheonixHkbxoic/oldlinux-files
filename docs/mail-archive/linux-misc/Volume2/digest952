The problem is properly that you dont have a /etc/dosemu.users file, specifying
who is allowed access to the Dosemu.  The format is simple - just one line
per user login id who is allowed access.

I have got the kernel 1.00 running and the chance to get an Future Domain
SCSI-1 All in One plus (with TMC-950) or a SCSI-2 All in One (with TMC-1800)
quite cheap. Now I wonder if anyone has got any experience with one of them
- most important if they are supported or not (the doc is not fully clear -
it says "Seagate .../Future Domain ... TMC-950" with some problems, "Future
Domain 16x0 with TMC-1800" - I don't know if the SCSI-2 board is compatible
with any 16x0 board).

Sorry if this question was treated here already - I've just joined the group
(yeap, I know - strongly against netiquette).
And again against netiquette: Could you please answer through Email as my
newsfeed isn't too stable at the moment and I could easily miss an article.
I'll post a summary if something of common interest arrives.

Thank you very much for any help!

Bye,

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted biweekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not a contribution to the development
of Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration
- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Well, just to set the record straighter, as someone with the same 
compialtion who is running fine.  His problems are problems with his 
setup, understanding, or expectations.  Although he really didn't give 
enough info for me to even TRy to diasgnose fully, quite a few of his 
problems seemed to fall into the same calss as the xmodem one-- lack of 
understanding rather then lack of system performance...  (And over it all 
was a VERY conentious attitude, almost like he wanted it to fail.  In my 
experience, my machine always works better when I try to understand it... 
kinda like people...)

        Unfortunately, for those of us who don't have Motif, the
compiled binary on sunsite is version 3.0, and it's a mess.  It
crashes so often it's unusable.  Would some kind soul who has compiled
3.1 with Motif please upload a statically linked version to sunsite?

        They may need new solutions, but they don't need a bunch of

work done.

        I ask you again... since you stated that the main thing
they'll be doing is word processing, WHAT WORD PROCESSOR ARE YOU GOING
TO USE UNDER LINUX on these dumb terminals?

        And, I think you're going to have to use X-Terminals, not dumb
terminals.  Have you checked out the price of X-Terminals?  They ain't
cheap, guy.  And these days, low-end Macs are available to educational
institutions for considerably less than $2,500 a pop.

I am sorry but what is wrong with using the iBCS module and running SCO 
wordperfect. In fact iBCS currently allows linux to run binaries from
lots of other intel unices with work on *BSD being made as we speak.

Linux doesn't need a WP of its own when it can be used as a base to run
apps from all the other major opearing systems (unices, windows under wine 
ans dos under dosemu).

My problem was that minicom worked, but seyon doesn't.
Surely I have changed cua to ttyS when I was using both programs...

To solve this problem I've watched the permissions and noticed, that
minicom has SUID root and seyon only 755 root.root.
After setting SUID for seyon everything now works fine, but I am not
sure if this hack(?) could be a security hole. Anyway, I have only a

They don't seem to have a Linux version of Netscape (mozilla!!) at 
mcom.com. They do have HPUX, SunOS, Etc. I used the HPUX version to 
display on my Linux machine and it looks pretty sharp!

Perhaps some email to the good folks at mcom.com might get a Linux

 Not directly, latest available patch (although I can't find where I
got it from) is against 1.1.50 I think. With hand patching you can get
that to work on 1.1.54 , at least we have on mechnix.me.liv.ac.uk
(compiled without errors, not tested yet due to 'us' being 100 miles
away from the machine, not handy if it fargs up... we have to wait for
THE admin to be around just in case, but we have quotas on 1.1.53
running fine).

  The one we got for 2.0.0 was only a patch against 1.1.21, not
good... (then again the kernel srcs with 2.0.0 are for 1.1.18 *boggle*)

You can get a single for $300 and at school we used to run the single on
multiple machines all the time.  No idea why.  I personally think
floating licenses are a ripoff.  I know people with more than one
machine at home and it's stupid for them to not be able to log into
either of them and run a program.

Yeah, I know all about loss of sales but I think most of that is BS.

Subject: Lynx+term blocks modem
Date: 16 Oct 1994 20:01:45 GMT

Hi all


I am running Term 2.1.4 on 1.1.54 kernel.
My problem is this :
  When I use Lynx (downloaded from sunsite) with term and the
 host I connect to is unavailable, the modem line is blocked and no 
transfer takes place for a few minutes. Term.log just says there are
timeout errors. The point is that if a host is available and accepting 
connections
there is no problem. Usually after the modem restarts, I can only use 
about 1/2 of bandwidth ,eg if doing tdownload of about 200cps, but
after running lynx and connecting  host is  not responding (eg ftp to 
sunsite) tdownload continues with about 100cps and this can also be seen 
on tmon with graph 1/2 previous size.


I tried recompiling term with no success. (lynx is binary on sunsite)

I would appreciate it if somebody could help.
PS: If you need more info, email me at
  starmage@aztec.co.za

Thanx
 Andre

Thanks for all the comments from other people .. 

umm the problem is still there, but I have isolated the problem.

1.   The PAS-16 SCSI interface seems to work.
2.   When I plug in the CD-ROM to the PAS, it tries to workk with
     the CDROM but ends up just sitting in :

        Detected SCSI CD-ROM sr0 @ scsi0, id1, lun 0
        scsi0: reseting for second half of retries.

This is where it hangs... Anybody else have this problem ?

I have tried 2 versions of the PAS16.. 650-0044-06H and 650-0097-05D.
Both exhibit the same problem.

I tried talking to mediavision but they (as I expected) didn't 
know anything about Linux and the PAS16.

Thanks in advance

Well, it turn out that the new kernel can't handle the IRQ setting
that I had for the old (1.0.8) kernel.  There was an error message
during the bootup process and I didn't notice it before since it pass
by pretty fast.  Anyway, all I had to do was reassign my IRQ to a different
unused one and that was that.  By the way, my controller card is the
Ultrastor 34FA.  The IRQ that was giving me problem was IRQ10.
Now if I can only get my Stealth Pro to go 16 bit color depth.  Any
hints?
