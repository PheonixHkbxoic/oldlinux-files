Date: 29 Sep 1994 03:05:20 GMT

I am willing to begin compiling a SLIP/PPP FAQ.  I would appreciate it
if people could send me any of their dip scripts or insight.  I have had
a fair amount of experience in getting SLIP up and running with my Linux
box and the campus network, and personally found the lack of information
somewhat frustrating.  It is for that reason that I am volunteering to do
this.  Thanks for any contributions!

Please don't do that.
They won't understand what Unix is with such a system; and find
their actual Windows or OS/2 setup much more powerful.

I hope your article is just a joke :-)

Hmm, I was told that 5.1 was the first X version.... perhaps they meant
the first X version for SCO.  Maybe an earlier, slower, buggier version
was available for other platforms.

Time to change OS's?  Maybe you could run the newer version remotely....
or, if for some reason you hate WP, not just the DEC 5.0 version, then
use something else.... $$$$ Framemaker,  Island Write,  On-Go,  Applixware...

And all the above have SCO versions which should also run under Linux IBCS!!!

I'm not going to include the body of Mr. Tso's artcial because I don't 
want to waste the bandwidth, as its not really necessary to my point.

Something you seem to be forgetting is that the concept of 'intent' 
carries alot of weight in teh courts.  In the case of Jobs' files, the 
clear INTENT was that users link it with the GNU stuff.  For this reason, 
it coudl be argued as falling within GNU's right to keep that from 
happening, as GNu liscneses its software for very specific uses.  (Now 
whetehr they coudl sue Jobs, or whether they woudl have to after the 
people using his stuff, i don't know.  I suspect however Jobs coudl be 
seen as 'inducing' the breach of contract, for whatever thats worth... 
thats just a feeling though, I'm not nearly well enough versed in law to 
make a statement to that effect.)

In your dbm case, YOUR clear intenet is that it be linekd with dbm.  thus 
YOU are not trying to get anyone to void their agreement with FSF.

A very different case.

I think that characterization of the Linux community is incomplete.
My dad will probably get a copy, and the fact that it exists makes it
more likely that his department will move to Linux on fast Pentiums
the next time they switch workstations.

He oversees department computer resources for a major physical science
department at a big research university.  Budget crunches mean that
Linux is already very attractive (cheap hardware, even cheaper software ;-)
and the availability of such things as Maple makes Linux even more so.

There may yet be a student version of Maple for Linux.  The best way
to ensure that is to write a polite letter to the company.

A letter that simply says

1) You are happy to see that Maple has been ported to Linux
2) You look forward to the availability of a student version
3) You will buy said student version when it appears

is all that is required.  Linux propaganda and other like stuff
is probably counterproductive---they've already realized the potential
for Linux, we just have to get them to take one small baby step beyond
that.

Many have. I have posted twice myself about it and seen at least 5 other 
posts not including this thread. I have never seen a response and my emails
to other posters has never been answered. It's pissing me off that nobody
seems to know the answer or have a fix. I've been patching my kernel up
to 1.1.51 (I think it got worse at .51) as well as rebuilding my daemons.

I read a few days ago that the next release of the networking code fixes
a problem that sounds like this but I've seen no followups as to when it
will be released.

As the admin of a public access system it is of great concern to me, I've
had sendmail die for about 2 days before I noticed as well as the other
problems described. I spend more time now checking/killing/rebooting
my network stuff than I do giving more value to my users. I might just
switch to *BSD, at least the network code works.

Ahh... more likely what Linux is NOT all about.  It is my opinion that the
average DOG/Windoze user would perceive such a Linux distribution as a
somewhat brain-dead version of what they are already using.

Subject: SCO COFF lib -> Linux
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 16:17:38 GMT

I have some SCO 3.2.2 COFF libraries that I would like to use under Linux
is there a way to convert these libraries to BSD, so I that can use them under
linux.

I remember a few years ago there was something like "rubotassin" that did
the opposite.

Any help will be appreciated.

In an article about a TCP/IP training course offered by Thailand's
National Electronic and Computer Technology Centre (NECTEC) it said
that the state owned university libraries will be getting Linux
boxes from NECTEC. The original article was in the Bangkok post.
(Good luck finding that at your local newsstand.)

Now who said that Linux was just a hacker's toy? <grin>
