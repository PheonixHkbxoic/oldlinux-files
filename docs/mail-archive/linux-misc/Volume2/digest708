Subject: Hardware problem with Kelvin64 / PCI
Date: 04 Sep 1994 14:19:29 GMT


Hiya, 

Last night I posted a cry for help booting Linux on a PCI based
machine. After some investigation, the problem seems to lie with the
Orchid Kelvin 64. To be more specific:

Booting linux (a variety of kernels between 1.0.8 -> 1.1.49) with a
Kelvin card in a PCI bus on my machine produces a hang after the
Uncompressing Linux message. If I replace the card with a random SVGA
card in one of the ISA bus slots the machine boots correctly. I'd be
grateful for any advice, be it a solution or merely a pointer showing
me where to dig.

Thanks,

  13.1. Software Oscilloscope


     Author
        Jeff Tranter, Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.COM

     Description
        Scope is a simple software emulation of an oscilloscope. It
        graphically displays voltage as a function of time.

     Status
        ALPHA. First release.

     System requirements
        Sound card with input capability supported by the kernel sound
        driver. SVGALIB is used to do the display work.

     Detail
        Scope uses the /dev/dsp device to take audio in from the
        soundcard and displays it on the screen in a manner similar to
        an oscilloscope.  Jeff claims Scope was written more for
        amusement value than for any serious purpose.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        You can obtain source, makefile and man page for Scope from:
        sunsite.unc.edu
        (ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/scope-0.1.tar.gz)

Actually I think you sign the message with your private key so that it can
then be authenticated by anyone with your public key.  If you signed it with
your public key then anyone who possessed your public key would be able to

        I'm still pretty new to linux...can you e-mail me your s-linux.h file,
or at least tell me what has to be defined?  I tried and I can't get it to

I had this problem too.  g3topbm seems to use an amazing amount of
memory.  I have 16MB plus about 12 MB swap, and that is usually
insufficient.  Sometimes it is enough if I kill x.  Instead I had to increase
my swap (by adding a swap file).  16MB memory plus 20MB swap always
seems to be enough.

It seems kind of ridiculous, and of course it is a little slow since
it is using all this swap space.  It is a fun way to get your hard disk
light to go on and stay on for several minutes!

In general, you need *a lot* of memory to run the pbm tools, especially
on images of the size of a FAX.
Did you try to add swapspace?  That may help.  However, once I tried to
rotate an image by 90 degrees, and even 80M of swapspace wasn't enough :-(
(this wasn't a FAX, but a 300dpi scanned A4 sheet.  however, the situation
is similar for FAXes)

It should really be possible to handle some of the special cases of
conversion much more efficient than pbm does it...

Probably because you told it to do so in the configuration file.
There it says something like "boot=/dev/hda1" and you selected your
DOS partition there.

This is not normally happening when you put LILO in the DOS bootsector.
Are you sure it is really caused by LILO and not some other mistake?

>But now when I do dir c: I get nothing but garbage.  I need to know

That is documented in many places.  Many disk utilities also have this
knowledge built-in so you can edit the bootsector using meaningful
numbers.  (E.g. Norton DE)

LILO saves your bootsector in a file.  However, from the above description
I doubt it was LILO that caused this problem, so maybe it did not save
the bootsector either.  If it did, look in /boot for a file "boot.0201"

Not sure how the 8900CL differs from the 8900C, but I had an 8900C and it
was truly pathetic.  Its speed was fine in DOS, but under Windows, OS/2,
and Linux/X it was horrible.  Scrolling in an xterm or shell window took
forever, and shot the CPU meter through the roof.  I now have an Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280+ with 1 Meg and an S3 chip, and I scroll like blazes
without affecting the CPU at all.  It does have that font bug (I'm still
running XFree 2.0), but I hardly care.  I use restorefont from SVGAlib
and I have no trouble.  The card cost me about $150 mail order, and that
was almost a year ago.  I'm talking ISA here in both cases, on a 486DX33.
I get about 58,000 xstones now, which is more than 10 times as many as
I got with the Trident.

The boot record (as you have guessed) contains information about the
geometry of the disk on which it resides: number of cylinders, heads
per cylinder, sectors per head, and the total number of sectors on
the disk.  If your 130 drive differs in any way other than the total number
of sectors, or the number of cylinders (and sometimes even if these
are different) you'll get garbage.

This problem *must* occur, because DOS (like many other systems) keeps its
disk references in terms of sectors and clusters, which must be translated
to cylinder/head/sector format before the physical disk can be accessed.
If the numbers used in this translation are wrong, all sorts of Bad Things
can occur.

The format of the drive parm table in the boot sector is documented in
the MS-DOS Programmer's Reference from MS Press and available in most
large bookstores.

Here's a fragment from one of my routines:

Most of the fields are self-explanatory; the mysterious "hidden sectors"
is the number of sectors one must skip over on the *phycical* disk before
reaching the boot sector you're looking at.  If your DOS partition is at
the front of the physical disk, the number of hidden sectors will
usually be equal to the number of sectors on one track.

Note the ".radix 16" line: the default radix for numbers in this fragment
is hex rather than decimal.

Use a sector editor to fix up your drive parm table and you've got a better
chance of recovering the use of the disk.  Norton Utilities allows you to
edit the symbolic contents of the DPT, and somewhere I think it has some
other functions for the explicit purpose of rebuilding a damaged boot
sector.

Try using a DOS boot disk and typing

fdisk /mbr on hte dos partition

Then use fdisk to remake the partition active.
