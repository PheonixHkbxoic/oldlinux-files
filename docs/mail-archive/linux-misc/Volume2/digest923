You SHOUDL be confused, because so was the last poster!  :)

Linux is a UNIX work-alike.  In these matters it is very similar. UNIX is 
a true pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system. This means that 
multiple 'processes' may be run at once and that they share the available 
resources, such as the CPU.  A program will be one or more processes (a 
program can 'fork' itself to start new processes. Thsi is hwo most daemons 
operate.)  Because you can run many process at once, you can run many 
programs, or many copies of the same program at once.

UNIX implements multi-user access by running a seperate 'shell' process 
for each user.  (There are actually other process invovled too, such as 
getty which handles the terminal io, but thats more detail then you 
probobly need.)

So yes, UNIX is multi-threaded in the sens that there are multiple threads
of control operating in a time-sliced fashion.  The term 'threading' is
often used in multi-tasking system however to denote a 'lesser form' of
multi-taskign that goes on completely within a single process.  thsi is
also sometimes called 'light-weight multi-tasking'.  UNIX (and Linux)
don't inhearently preclude this, but implementation of it is up to the
makers of a light-weight tasking library (such as the berkley light-weight
multi-tasking library) or teh compiler system in cases where light-weight
multi-tasking is built directly into the compiler system (as in Modula2). 

All of the above are generalizations.  If you REALLY want to know more 
then you can pick up an intro operating systems text.  Particularly 
useful would be one that discuss UNIX in detail.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

I managed to install X on my linux box and seem to have configures Xconfig 
properly.  So upon starting "startx" everything runs smoothly.  My question 
is, when I exit X, i see the message . . . 

"xinit: unknown error (errno 0) client error"

What is this aerror for.  Everything seems to work fine but this is bugging 
me.

Also, does anyone have any mwm-like system.fvwm configerations I could use. 
 There are a few in the slackware distribution, but I'm sure ther must be 
some real hot ones out there.

If the whole point is to give linux things that windows has already, why not
just wait for WINE? Running the programs they already know and love will
appeal much more strongly to the average dos/win user.

About a year ago (as someone already mentioned in this thread), some people
tried to write a WYSIWYG LaTeX interface. If something with that kind of
power is not the object of this discussion, whoever takes this project on
will just be wasting their time, in my opinion. There may be no WINE before
its time, but I think WINE will be running word for windows long before a
comparably powerful packages can be put together for Linux. The lead is just
too great.

I think that rather than trying to appeal to the dos and windows users, this
project should follow the Unix tradition of doing things right.

There is no need to appeal to the dos and windows users. They are flocking
to Linux almost as fast as they are hearing about linux, and the reasons are
growing daily. But I for one would hate to see Linux turned into merely a
multitasking dos. One of the evils of Word and WordPerfect etc., is that you
can't without great difficulty, work on files in a different word processor.
They do this and other things on purpose, to make you dependant on their
program.

I suggest that people reconsider a WYSIWYG LaTeX interface, keeping in mind
that it would not have to contain every LaTeX feature in order to be useable
and to create LaTeX output. There would be no need to know LaTeX, yet it
would be there for manual tweaking and editing with vi at your friend's
house. Also, it already exists and is an exceptional package. Why reinvent
the wheel? Just put a motor on it and watch it go.

Just my opinion.

Subject: smail configuration woes...
Date: 12 Oct 1994 05:50:57 GMT
Reply-To: doug@interaccess.com

I'm currently connecting to the internet via a dialin PPP connection.  I've
configured smail to route mail through my PPP host as a smart_host (I'm using
it right now), but it only works if I'm actually connected via PPP.  If I
try to send mail while I'm not connected, I get the following:

|------------------------- Failed addresses follow: ---------------------|
 lenz@comm.mot.com ... transport smtp: connect: Network is unreachable
|------------------------- Message text follows: ------------------------|

I've tried using the 'retry' file and durations in my smail config, but it
insists on dying if my PPP connection is not up when I try to send mail.

Is there ANY way to be able to have smail retry sending mail if the smtp
connection is down?

Right now I've kludged it my having smail only queue mail. Then when I start
up my PPP connection, I enable smail to process the queue in the background.
When I shut down my PPP connection it likewise kills smail so that it won't
try sending anything.  Certainly there must be a better way.

ANY help would be appreciated (I can forward my config files if needed).

Thanks in Advance!

Hah.  Apparently you didn't hear that the Am486 DX/2 66 could be safely
over-clocked to run at 80Mhz.  All the DX2-80 is is a relabeled DX2-66.
That's why it's not much more expensive.  It's the same chip.  Anyone wanna

The chip is manufactured (here in Austin, I might add) by Advanced Micro 
Devices (AMD).  It is an internally clock-doubled 33MHz CPU, just like the
i486DX2-66.  As far as I know, there are no 'real' 66 MHz chips.  The pin-out
is identical to the Intel; it is supposed to work in Intel 486-compatible
motherboards, although from experience this is not always the case.

I am running Linux 1.1.45 on a mystery motherboard (UMC chipset) with an AMD
486DX2/66 with no problems, although my first motherboard choice (OPTi chipset)
had trouble when I upgraded the cache from 64K to 256K.  Older versions of the
chip reportedly had problems with Ghostscript, but gs (and everything
else) runs just fine on mine.  Be sure to get one with the MS Windows-
compatible logo on it; these are newer and more compatible, and you can cover
up the logo with a heatsink!
