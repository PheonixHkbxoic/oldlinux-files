Let go?  BS.  NeXT NEVER supported any sort of real develpment outside of
stuff they got a cut of.  Even their hardware was aimed at maximizing the amount 
of money you gave directly to them.  This is Jobs' way of operating:
we (they) supply you with everything (at a cost).  Nothing else is compatible,
and it all is color-coordinated.

They blew it from the beginning by not going with X.  They didn't care about
compatibility, and paid the price.  I don't see them changing heart.  It 
would be GREAT to see an X/NextStep combination (not an X emulator under NS),
but we'll have to wait and see.

I don't think you can use it via a DOS command, but you certainly can
switch to another screen, umount /cdrom, swap the disk, and mount /cdrom
again.  Then go back to the DOS screen and tell it you have swapped the
disk.

That will give you even more trouble than 192.0.0.1 !!!

These addresses above 224 are not to be used for hosts.  The address

Even though this is a bit off topic, the point here is that rather then
pay >$10,000 US for an Indigo, you can get a PC if all you want is a 
generic UN*X-like box.  Absolutely true.  

The integrated A/V is still Vaporware, though, until I see at least an
Indigo^2 with Cosmo compress and a Broadcast quality video frame
buffer/ capture board (meaning at least Beta(YRV), RGB, or D1 at or
above specified broadcast quality levels).  That's not here yet, and
though SGI promises it in the next few months, I just went through
enough months of pain trying to get a Mac product with similar
promises up and running to make me leery.  But then, SGI is goooood.

So, if what you want to do is putz around with a un*xlike OS, and learn
about networking cheaply (likeme) then Linux is the god.  Pray at the alter.

No, no, no (shaking head sadly).  First, I believe that the PCI bus is

There are basically four files you are interested in:

        ppp-on
                ip-up

        ppp-off
                ip-down

Each one of them is a shell script (at least that works for me on my machine)

The first pair is used to setup a connection and take care of all the things
that  might be needed to use the interface.

The second pair does the opposite. 

The ip-up and ip-down are executed by the pppd so they really have nothing to 
do with the wrappers (ppp-on and off).  In my case they look something like this:

Ok here they are.  There is still some problems though.  Namly I am having 
problems keeping the connection up automatically.. I have to manual run 
some command such as ping or something to keep it up.  The automatic  way
which I included in the above scripts doesnt work for me.  

I posted a question about it to the group too so maybe someone else knows.

Also there is no 'on-demand dailing' support in this version of pppd so
you can do somthing like telnet machine and have your modem dial it up
and establish a connection.

A daemon that can do that is dp-2.3 or somthingk like that but I am having
a hell of a time trying to port it to the Linux box.  Maybe someone with more
knowledge of the internals could do that.

I will make the above scripts nice and upload them to sunsite some time soon
or I can post them here since they are small enought if there is interest.

I hope that will help you get started.  I just got my box on the net in the
same way and it kicks.... (or blows chunks as my friend likes to refer to it) ;-)

Agreed. I've seen lots of PCs that waste resources bacause of lack of

However, UNIX is not easy to use if users (who dosen't know UNIX well)

It would be really great if these drives could *write* audio format
discs too. Then you could record from a sound card and not have to mess
about with tape and stuff.

Also, it would be really neat for automatically managing a computer based
database of all your MDs. Just pop it in and you can get all the track
information, edit it, make up your favourite music compilations etc.

Anyone know if this is likely? I guess the drive would have to know how
to compress the audio data as well as how to decompress it.

I've got Linux installed along with DOS and OS/2 on a multiboot
system. Unfortunately, after I use Linux and warm reboot, I have conflicts
(either IRQ, DMA, addresses, or something) with Windows in DOS and OS/2.

When I start either up, it repeats the sound over and over again --
eg. the opening fanfare gets repeated.

I've got a Gateway 2000 486DX33, with 8Mbs of RAM, 256K cache, with
COM1 (IRQ 4), COM2 (IRQ 3), PAS16 (IRQ 5, 10 and DMA 1, 7), NE2000
ethernet card (IRQ 11, address $360). I've got all the standard
setups otherwise.

Any ideas? I'd hate to have to Reset after every use of Linux (booting
twicw for every use!)
