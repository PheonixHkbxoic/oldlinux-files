        Without DOS and Windows the  world of computing would probably
be a lot  more  developed today than   what  it is.  Everything   that
MicroSloth gets  on  the  market today  is  supposed  to  be  new  and
groundbreaking technology...although most of what  they have to  offer
has already been implemented  in the unix world  long ago. MS has been
talking  about a system where everything  you use  will be just module
that sonnect together  to form an entirety. To  me that sounds exactly
like unix, although their idea will probably include  a lot of 'nifty'
graphics and OLE aso. MS has also announced that it in MS-DOS 7.0 will
include multi-tasking   (that must be a  nightmare,  just  think about
multi-tasking in Windows),  this, if I'm not  mistaken :), is  already
included in unix.
        Since I'm bitching  at MS why not  also say somthing about NT.
NT stands  for New Technology, hah,  what's new about 32-bti operating
systems?  And now with the Pentium coming around the New Technology is
somewhat  outdated... Well OK, Linux  is 32-bit too  but I think Linux
will  be 64-bit before  Win-NT. And what  about  Chicago... isn't that
32-bit code too?

        I'm not really a big  fan of MicroSloth,  if you didn't  guess
and this was just my $.01 worth :)

        a CD-ROM distribution (nearly any CD-ROM drive on SCSI)
        by means of utilizing the DOS drivers for whatever hardware is present...

    3 an installer that allows you to select which utilities you like, etc,

There are text editors for X which approximate word processors, I
don't use any of them, so I won't comment on them.  For technical 
writing (Math/CS at least), TeX is in general easier and more flexible
to use than any word processor on any platform, and is more convenient
on Unix than for DOS/Mac.  Unlike some, I don't think that it replaces
a general-purpose word processor, but I don't do enough writing
writing to justify using another program.  There are no shortage of 
text-editors aimed at any & every sort of user.

SC is a general-purpose text-based spreadsheet, and there is a GNU
spreadsheet, OLEO, that runs under text or X.

I don't know about heavy-duty CAD, but xfig is a good drawing program
on the MacDraw level, and integrates well with TeX.  Xfig can produce
PostScript output, or drawing commands for LaTeX or FigTeX.

You didn't have the honor(?) of getting to use WordPerfect 4.2 for SCO and
Altos System V (Series 1000) (character mode only)... you want badly written
software?

WPcorp has a better grasp of *ix with each version they release; 5.1 is quite
reasonable (aside from weird bugs in the SunOS4.1 version, not present in the
SCO version) and 6.0 for Solaris 2 is quite nice.  Assuming you like
WordPerfect, of course; I'm rather ambivalent toward it, since every time I
want to do something useful I seem to always end up doing it in LaTeX instead
because of limitations in WP.  ---I haven't tried 6.0 in this context yet,

The issue Linus settled was how _he_ pronounces it by posting those files.
He settled the issue of other people saying it by saying that people should
pronounce it as it is natural in their language/culture. Having been to a
talk by Linus, I think his response would be that of apathy. I'm sure he
doesn't really mind at all how you pronounce it as long as it's close. 

Personally, one thing that does get on my nerves is people pronouncing it
'Linix' which just seems completely non-sensical.

With Xfree86 under Linux the /tmp/.X11-unix directory which holds
the X connection socket is created with mode 0777.  This seems (at
least to me) to be a major problem.  I don't know whether it creates
any security holes, but any user on the system can then go and delete
the socket, and kill your X connection.  I checked the Ultrix and
Irix 4.0.5 boxes here, and although the SGIs have the same problem
the Ultrix boxes create the directory with mode 1777.

Can somebody give me a ruling on whether I'm talking crap or not?

This is really dumb.  Windows is going towards user accounts, and most 
people at University have used networked machines, so they can surely cope 
with the idea of a multiuser machine.

This is silly as well.  BASH is too big, and too slow - the performance 
gains achieved by replacing bash with ash are very noticable on your 
standard DOS-Windows setup (486 with 4 megs, ISA bus and IDE drives).

This seems silly.  Just because it works for DOS doesn't mean that removing 
all the standard UNIX stuff is a good idea.

Great.  What about all these spods who play MUDs?  I've lost count of the 
number of people who have switched to Linux over here just so they can play 
with their very own MUD ...

And isn't PPP a better idea to SLIP these days?

This is silly.  SCSI hardly costs you anything, and you're completely 
locking out everyone with SCSI-only setups.  Plus a lot of people hang CD-
ROM drives off the SCSI port of their soundcards ...

Get real.  Having to put up with 256 colour mode with X is bad enough, but 
do you really expect anyone to take X Windows running in 16 colours 
seriously?  (Never mind the idea of low resolution)

crw--w--w-   1 root     tty        4,   0 Sep 30 14:35 /dev/console

but when I start 'cmdtool -C' nothing happens.  When I start 
'xconsole' as root 'echo foo > /dev/console' works.  But as nonroot
I only get the error message "Couldn't open console" when starting
'xconsole'.

Two questions

Why doesn't the 'cmdtool -C' work?

Why does 'xconsole' only work for root?

Several points....  First, I know I'm being picky here, but if you are
in an environment where you can't spell TeX with the lowered 'E', DEK
specifically says it's spelled ``TeX''.  See chapter 1 in ``The TeXbook''.

Second, TeX is not GNU software.  It may be redistributed with other GNU
software, but that's as far as the relationship goes.

Finally, TeX is very, very well-documented.  You've just been looking in
the wrong places.  If you're interested in plain TeX, try the following:

   *) ``First Grade TeX''
   *) ``The TeXbook'' by DEK himself
   *) ``TeX by Topic'' by Victor Eijkhout
   *) check with the TeX User's Group (TUG) for the rest---there's a lot
      more!

``First Grade TeX'' is a very nice beginner's book, but you'll out-grow
it rather quickly.  Fortunately, at least when I bought it (a long, long
time ago), it isn't very expensive.

``The TeXbook'' is, of course, a must.

``TeX by Topic'' is a great book, once you've advanced your TeXnical
skills.

Again, check with TUG (e-mail:  tug@math.ams.com) for more details.

Also check the FAQ and FAQ Supplement on comp.text.tex.

If you're looking for docs on LaTeX, check with TUG.  I use plain TeX, so
my answers are obviously geared in that direction.  :-)

Actually, it is, but you're not allowed to run TeX on it---it's for use
as example code, only.  I don't recall where it's available for ftp, but
that's probably in the FAQ or FAQ Supplement (for comp.text.tex, obviously).

Either way, though, if you want a printed copy, your only choice is to

XFree86 2.1.1.

The problem I am having is that the boot disk makes a Ram disk and then
boots the system from RAM. Then it tells me to load the root disk which also
works fine. After this when I try to run the fdisk , it says "out of memory"
.Having only 4 MB of RAM , i need the command that disables the ram disk and
