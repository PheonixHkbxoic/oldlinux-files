Subject: Why Linux can't do that?
Date: 7 Sep 1994 07:58:41 GMT


Hello everybody

I have a C++ class called bigint which has some I/O member functions like


/**
  ** using fread/fwrite
  **/

  void read_from_file(FILE * fp);
  void write_to_file(FILE * fp);

  /**
  ** using fscanf/fprintf
  **/

  void scan_from_file(FILE * fp);
  void print_to_file(FILE * fp);

I tried to port this to an Intel 468 running Linux; well the compilation
is done without warnings but at linking in a program like 

  ...
  bigint I;
  I.scan_from_file(stdin);
  ...

I get the error message

bigint_appl.c:187: cannot lookup method in incomplete type `_fake_filebuf'

I looked in the stdlib.h an I have seen that stdin, stdout, stderr are
typedef'ined to this struct.

Question
========

Is there a library I have to link explicitly or another include file (I include
only stdlib.h stdio.h)

I would appreciate it if you would answer by email 
(papanik@crypt10.cs.uni-sb.de)

Thank you in advance for any suggestions,

Thomas

Reply-To: rogina@ira.uka.de (Ivica Rogina)


How can I find out how much physical memory is left for some process to use.
Depending on the shell under which a program is running, it can allocate up to
3 gigs of memory. Trying to access them just makes the process eat up 
swap pages and almost stop the entire system. Is there a way how malloc() will
return no more then RAM + SWAP - ALREADY_USED_BY_OTHER_PROCESSES ?
When fooling around with malloc(), I can even cause segmentation faults and
similar errors without ever doing anything illegal. This behaviour of the
system is really annoying, since I'd like run quite big processes without
paralizing my entire machine.

Just a word of caution for all Linux users out there using v1.0.8 and
are going to upgrade to v1.1.8.. The SLIP support seems to be broken..
I upgraded and every 5 minutes the modems and dip will just hangup on
each other... I am going to try v1.1.45 and if it doesn't work does
anybody know where to report this bug too.

Subject: Exercise for Experts
Date: Wed, 7 Sep 1994 11:53:30 GMT

Like many others, I'm looking to buy a PC to put Linux on. I'm reading
all the FAQs HOWTOS etc, and getting a lot of information. However,
I'm still finding it difficult to make a decision about what to buy,
especially in the area of Bus/Graphics/SCSI etc.

It would be *really* useful to me, and I suspect to quite a few
others, if a few experts would be kind enough to give their definitive
opinion on final configuration for a system. What I'm thinking of, is
describing three different configurations, one for beginner, one for
intermediate and one for advanced, all giving the best performance for
that level.

The criteria being that the beginner system should be : buy it,
install Linux (pref from CD) and start using straight away with the
minumum of problems. The advanced system might include things which
are semi or nearly supported (MACH64 ??), which need a bit of messing
about, but probably give you better performance.

I would be really grateful for opinions on this. As a starting point,
the system I would really like to buy right now (but am a bit worried
about problems) is:

Pentium 90MHz (P54c) PCI
16 MB
ATI MACH64 graphics card
Adaptec 2942 PCI SCSI or BUS LOGIC BT-946C controller
Disk > 1.0GB SCSI
17 inch Monitor
Twin speed Panasonic CDROM
Galaxy Pro 16 soundcard

I'm not really interested about windows or Dos performance (I will use
them but Linux is the most important)

Thanks a lot in advance.

If you haven't tried it already I would advise SWI-Prolog. It is a fairly nice
Prolog environment, and it compiled under different versions of Linux for me
(at least 0.99.14 and 1.0; the version I compiled with Linux 1.0 also runs
under Linux 1.1.19).

SWI-Prolog is available from ftp.swi.psy.uva.nl, can't remember the directory.
They also store a readline library for Linux somewhere, get it as well.

Linux isn't exactly U*IX, but it's pretty damn close. It's a full
implemetation of the POSIX spec, with SysV and BSD extensions.

Linux has DOSEMU and wine, but neither are out of the beta stage yet.
You can make a good point for DOS/Win compatibility for OS/2, and a
point about better multimedia support, but Linux 1.0.x is just as stable,
has better memory protection (granted, you can get the same protection
in OS/2 if you set IOPL=no, but some sound drivers may not work).
There's a package for Linux that will let you run SCO binaries, if you're
concerned about having shrinkwrap apps.

Where Linux really shines is in its *free* TCP/IP package. You can do
Mosaic native, telnet, ftp, nn, tin, trn, sendmail, cnews, pine, etc.
Running remote X clients is *way* faster under Linux than under OS/2.

Unkludged security. Multiuser capability. POSIX compliance (linux).
Source code free and clear (linux and FSF GPL). It boots! (OS/2 since
v2.11 has required me to hack the install procedure to get OS/2 to
boot - it's the broken aha152x.add problem, and it doesn't look like
IBM is ever going to fix it)

>2) Isn't the lack of "killer" apps a good reason not to use Unix?

Use the tools that get your work done. I liked OS/2, when I didn't 
have a net connection. I got a net connection, and my needs/desires 
started changing - Linux has more power and flexibility when it comes
to talking with the net. And it's light on the wallet, which is a big
plus for me.

I think learning about how OSes work is a worthy pursuit, and not a
waste of time. In the docs that come with the _Linux Kernel Hacker's
Guide_ they mention several books which you should read first, but
after that, the only way to learn is to fool around :).

That's not a fact, it's an opinion.

Subject: lpr and hp520
Date: 7 Sep 1994 12:40:29 GMT

I almost hate to ask this question since my linux version is ancient (0.98
I think) and I don't remember the history of my lpr/lpd/etc package, and I
don't claim to understand the intricacies of printcaps, but I'll ask it
anyways.

I just recently got an hp520 ink jet printer (mostly for my wife's DOS/WINDOWS
wordprocessing use) and I'd like to at least get it to be able to print out
simple text files under Linux.

If I use a printcap entry that looks like:

lp:lp=/dev/lp0:sd=/usr/spool/lp0:lf=/usr/adm/lpd-errs:sh

and I have a text file (called text_file) that looks like:

this is a
test of my printer
too bad it doesn't work

and I do "lpr text_file" it prints to the page like:

this is a
         test of my printer
                           too bad it doesn't work



Well, my first thought was that I could write a real simple output filter
program (called filter) that outputs a carrage return every time it sees a line
feed. So I wrote one that reads from standard in, writes to standard out, and
inserts carrage returns. In fact if I do "filter < text_file > /dev/lp0" it
prints out just like I'd expect. So I figured, I'd modify the printcap as
follows:

lp:lp=/dev/lp0:sd=/usr/spool/lp0:lf=/usr/adm/lpd-errs:of=/usr/etc/filter:sh


where the filter program had the path /usr/etc/filter. 

Well, I must have a very bad understanding of printcaps and output filters
because this didn't work at all. Now if I do "lpr text_file" nothing happens.
Nothing is printed on the printer, no errors are printed on the screen, no
errors logged to lpd-errs. All that happens is I get my bash prompt back.
If I do an "lpq" it tells me there are no entries in the queue (and sure
enough /usr/spool/lp0 doesn't have any files queued up).

It also doesn't help to change the "of=" to an "if=" in the printcap. It's as
though the filter program isn't called at all (I tried putting some statements
into the filter program that opens a temporary file, writes something to it,
and closes it.  When I ran "lpr text_file" I don't get that temporary file
created, which indicates to me that the filter program wasn't even started.


So my question is, what did I do wrong? Anybody have a solution for me?
Anyone have an hp520 filter/driver/whatever for lpr under linux?

Kernels prior to 1.1.41 do not support higher-capacity floppy densities.
There are some patches to get up to 1.68MB (21 sectors) on a 1.44MB floppy
on prior kernels; 1.1.41 through 1.1.49 support these formats and up to
24 sectors equivalent (1.92 MB).

However, be warned that 1.1.x kernels are development kernels, not for
the casual user and not without risk.  If you do feel up to doing kernel
testing, make sure you get 1.1.49 or later; and get the "util" and new
"mtools" versions that go with it (on sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/kernel/patches/diskdrives/fdpatches-3.1-for-1.1.38.src.tar.gz).
Ignore the kernel patch, as it is already folded into the latest kernels.

If you don't feel confident experimenting with new kernels that could
potentially cause you serious problems, I suggest you wait for 1.2.0 of
the kernel to come out.

I'm not sure /etc/fdprm is even needed any more; there's also /etc/mtools
that actually gets in the way (e.g. on Extra Density 3.84 MB disks).
