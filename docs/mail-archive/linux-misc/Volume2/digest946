It also raises the question, "Why is there no non-X graphics support in
Linux, seeing as it _knows_ what the video driver looks like?".  I asked
ages ago about a RIP viewer for Linux without X.  A TeX viewer for Linux
without X would be nice, too.

Maybe people could port the DOS versions to Linux?

I dunno for newest kernel, but anyway, quota is included in Slackware 2.0.0,

After reading your message, it has me looking again into my problem.
I'm still looking for the solution... ;-)

I have a 486dx40 with 70ns SIMMS and 256k 20ns cache ram.  The machine
has problems while running with the cache turned on.  (i.e.  kernel
compile errors, garbage reads from disk, Slackware install crashed, etc.)
With cache turned off, the machine runs fine, except ~10% slower on compiles.

I've tried messing with the BIOS setups ad infinitum, with no luck.
Your post made me look again in the motherboard manual, and I found a
jumper setting.  Here is what it says:

"VL-Bus Master Setting

Set JP8 to configure the VL-Bus for zero wait state or one wait
state (default)."

It's currently set to ZERO wait states.   I don't remember exactly,
but I think I switched this (to ONE wait state) to test the cache problem
and the machine ran REALLY slow.  What does this jumper do?  It sounds
Bus related, not memory related.

Has anyone with an AMI BIOS had and fixed this problem?  What are your BIOS
settings?  

The motherboard I'm using is made by SI3 (p/n YM413201).

Subject: Re: Copyright Violations Plague the Net
Date: 15 Oct 1994 11:31:04 -0700

Intellectual property is an important and necessary legal concept in
a modern society. Stealing intellectual property is stealing. However
not all the terms in every program's license are legal and not everything
that is legal is moral.

We need to understand that this is a complex issue with no simple solutions.
Our current laws and current institutions are a long way from optimizing
technical progress. We need to change the laws and evolve institutions that
promote greater sharing while retaining economic incentives to do the work
in the first place.

There are many ways to do this. Supporting the League for Programming Freedom
is one. There is nothing wrong with having a copyright on a program's source
code but there is a great deal that is wrong with having a copyright on
the look and feel of a program or having a patent on a mathematical
method or an idea (as opposed to an implementation of the idea). These
distinctions are not simple and obvious. Lawmakers and judges who are
not knowledgeable in the technology can make atrocious decisions.
Campaign contributions from special interests can lead to even more
atrocious decisions. Reforming how we finance political campaigns can
have a huge impact on what future laws are like.

We need to change anti-trust laws to prevent excessive dominance in one
industry even if there were no anti-competitive measures taken to gain
that dominance. Large institutions are not necessarily bad but single
institutions that dominate an industry inevitably stifle progress. It
made me ill to hear that Microsoft was buying Intuit (the manufacturer
of Quicken), one of the few companies that has been able to compete with
them and win. 

There are experiments in new ways to develop and deliver software
that are evolving. The work of the FSF and Linux are remarkable achievements.
I am trying an experiment of my own in combining the free and commercial
models. I have released a tool for Digital Signal Processing under the
GPL and plan to release commercial versions of the same tool. If you
want to use ObjectProDSP for personal purposes or to create more free
software you can do so without cost. If you want to develop commercial
applications with it you need to purchase a commercial license. My hope
is that I will gain more from making the source code freely available
so others can contribute to my tool then I will loose by giving information
to my competitors.

If you want to be part of the solution and not part of the problem then
you have to understand that there is no simple formula to address these
complex issues.

Regarding "integrate existing editor", why not make it flexible like 'elm'
and 'tin', where a user can specify an editor like 'vi', 'jed', 'emacs',
or our favorite, 'ed' (not the line-mode ed, but an editor patterned after
DEC VMS's EDT editor) ?



That would allow a new user of this information processor to concentrate
on learning it, and not be distracted by having to learn a new editor as
well.

"Close"     _C      Alt<Key>F4      f.kill

        This should do the trick for you.

Well, as for converting DOS/Linux file formats:
Slackware has two little progs, fromdos/todos which do just that.
Moreover, there is a filter (don't remember its name) which converts RTF/TeX.
So it should be easy enough to move files between TeX/WinWord/Mac.

I heard there is a package for Emacs, called AUC-TeX, which uses a special TeX
mode. Where can I get it?
