First off, I failed to grasp your point.  There are reasons why 2.6.0
hasn't been oficially released by the linux community, namely the fact
that it is buggy and fails to compile some code (like some versions of
the kernel).  Can you imagine what would happen if newbies tried
compiling things and get an errors like "Internal error: cannot find
spill register"?

How do you figure?  Aside from /etc/inittab run state stuff, I can't
think of a thing that makes Linux look like SysV (yuck).  

When I compile stuff off the Net, I configure for BSD.

I hardly think that /proc counts either...

Keywords: gcc howto

Hiya:

Forgive me if this is a totally clueless question, but...... I have
zero programming background (took an intro basic course in '84) but
would very much like to start using gcc in Linux - downloaded the
gcc package from the Ygg cd last night. Where do I start? I need a
reall basic intro to C for linux users-type book. To give you an 
idea of what I've tried: borrowed a book on C from work. Tried the
newbie program that supposed to print "hello, world". Typed it in
as per instructions in the book. Ran cc hello.c and got a parse
error. Duh....huh? Took a look at LJ #5, and wouldn't you know it,
on the cover is a shot of some emacs windows with the EXACT same thing.
BUT, the script didn't look like the one I was trying to get to work.

Hence, I'm looking for some guidance. Anyone take pity on a poor soul
trying to better hisself through programming in C with Linux? Thanks.

Ack!  Whatever you do, do not buy a Xircom PCMCIA card!  Xircom does
not release any technical information about their cards, which means
that unless a miracle happens, they are never going to be supported by
Linux.

Stick with one of the cards on the "supported cards" list.  There are
really only three different cards: the D-Link (same as Linksys and
IC-Card), the IBM (same as Network General, Thomas-Conrad, Kingston,
and Novell), and the 3Com.  As for which to choose, I don't know of
any compelling reasons for picking any of these over any other.  I'd
be slightly wary of the 3Com card because I've received a few problem
reports that I haven't been able to track down, but most people have
no trouble with it.

BTW, I have a question.   Compiling  FreeBSD kernel  in 386 is much faster
than compiling Linux kernel in 486 with twice memory.
I found that Linux compiles everything whatever options I choose.
Am I doing something wrong, or is it the feature of Linux ?

Look, if you want to help support GNU's debugging effort by building
your kernel with a known-buggy compiler and risking your data, go
right ahead.  Compiling gcc on a linux box is easy, you just download
the file, untar it, type "./configure --target=i486-unknown-linux",
"make" and "make install".  You're quite welcome to do it -- I'm not
going to.

It proves that Linux can be installed on the system you bought
and ensures that Linux will support every component.
If you build your own machine, you may waste hours trying to install
and configure Linux before you discover that you made a mistake
and bought a component that Linux will not support.  Hardware vendors
usually charge a restocking fee (typically 15%) on returned components
unless you can prove that the parts were defective.

Linux workstation vendors are competitive with ordinary PC-clone vendors.
You might try getting a quote for a Linux workstation from SWT and compare
it with quotes for equivalent machines from some of the major mail order
PC-clone vendors.  I think you will find that Marvin Wu can match or beat
any other vendor's price.  This means that you get Linux installed and
configured essentially for free.

The problem with mail order Linux workstations is that it is a pain to get
warranty service through the mail.  This is why I recommend buying a Linux
workstation from one of your local PC-clone vendors.  There are half a dozen
vendors in my neighborhood who have promised to install Linux in the systems
they sell if the customer requests them to do so.  I see no reason why you
shouldn't be able to convince at least one of your local area vendors to do
the same.

Hope this helps, Bob Tisdale.

The October Uniforum Monthly has an ad for and a blurb about
a server from X-Inside called Accelerated X which runs on Linux,
SCO, Solaris, FreeBSD, and others. It is an X server only. 

They claim "highest performance", with truecolor, and 
up to 1600x1200 resolution (not on all hardware, of course).

No numbers or useful details except price is $199 (which seems steep).

You can set this up however you want, and map about anything to
buttons with any icon.  My only complaint is the default size of
the buttons are too large.  But this is easily changed.
Here is what I have mapped:

A. Previous desktop  B. Next desktop   C. Resize window 
D. Move window  E. Lower window  F. Iconify/deiconify 
G. Kill window  H. Xmagnify   I. xman  J. xmail
K. xfilemanager L. xterm  M. Desk-0 indicator  
N. Exit/Restart/Refresh menu.

Each button has an icon that shows clearly what the button does.
i.e.  Forexample button N shows a stop sign.

By using the side, istead of the bottom, I still have about 1024x910
of my 1152x910 display left.  Leaving me ruffly a square screen area 
to work with.

Whats wrong with them.  I prefere virtual screens to virtual desktops,
but normally I use a combination of both.  i.e. Completely separate
projects go on different desktops, the same project overflows to
different virtual screens.  Since it is a pain sticking windows
switching to another desktop and then unsticking them (the only way
I know to move windows between desktops) virtual screens tend to
be easier.

You can arrange your desktop however you want.  I agree this should be
much easier to configure.  It took me quite awhile to come-up with
something I think looks just as professional as as the HP-UX
environment.  Even longer to improve on it.  "vuewm" is you can't
load your own background, you have to stick to ugly patterns.  
I much prefere being able to have 'xv" load a random picture from
CD every 5 or so minuites, so I'm not constantly looking at the
same thing.

What is really needed is:

  1. A Null box.  i.e. Something that can be used to mark areas for
     xload, xbiff, and icons even when they aren't present, but as
     far as the window manager is conserned don't exist.

  2. Auto-resume from last session.  i.e.  Each time I end-up opening
     several xterms in one screen, emacs somewhere else, Mosaic, ...
     if fvwm could remember what I had running when I quit and ask
     me to restart them again, it would be quite a timesaver.

of the DOSEMU package, but the problem is I cannot compile it because the
linux source is not installed on my system because of limited space. So I
was wondering if I could get the binaries for it from somewhere (if possible
at all) or if someone could send it to me my e-mail. I do not have any
limitations on the size of the mail (although multipart is appreciated).
Once again, I am not sure if it is possible to install only the binaries
without compiling it, so please forgive me if this sounds stupid.

        Thank you very much in advance. Please send your replies to

Hello:

        I have recently installed Linux on my 25MHz pc with 8MB ram, and
everything seems fine, except once in a while I get this error:

mount cleanudp_creat RPC: portmap failure

        when I try to mount a file system. This does not happen all the time
though. I have not been able to figure out what makes this happen. Does
anyone have any idea or suggestions on why this is happening, and how I can
fix the problem?

        Thank you very much in advance. Please send your replies to
'rr002c@uhura.cc.rochester.edu'.
