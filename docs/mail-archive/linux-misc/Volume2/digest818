Just to confirm, we are running a dial-in Bulletin Board under sysVr4.2 and

So it's not specifically a Linux problem.   We too have tried changing packet
sizes etc.  We have used it on both an 8-port intelligent serial card, and on
separate 16550s with equal problems.   

Our suspicion is that there are still no really wonderful drivers for serial
ports under unix in general, especially the higher speed ones.

Our drealmBBS system should be in general distribution very soon now.  It's
got quite extensive configuration options, and the menus are what I would call
semi-programmable.  Trouble is as yet you have to edit them by hand (we
haven't had time to write fancy menu creators).

We are expecting a load of flames from this group, as we are not distributing
source with the general release, but we have been careful to not infringe any
Free Software licences (I hope people will point out if they think we might
have slipped up somewhere!)

The two-node version will be free, but we'll ask for some nominal registration
fee for a higher-node version - on the assumption that if you can afford more
than one line and modem you can afford to help us with some of our costs (as
yet we have *still* to break even on our own system after 4 years!!!)

It's got things like top callers, message posters and message/call ratio and
we intend to add more as time goes by.

We also commissioned an offline reader which runs under windows and is now
available as Shareware.  There is an alternative OLR which is available as
source for unix and dos.  I can give out details but I had better check with
these guys that they are ready to be 'advertised' here (-: 

While designing the system, we bore in mind what was popular about the DOS bbs
systems, (including definable user flags and security levels), while trying to
also provide an interface to the normal life of a unix system (for instance
you can import Unix mail into internal drealm format and out again). 

Please don't mail me to get a copy yet,  as I will certainly announce the
release in various places in the near future.

Hi,
        has anybody used the Hayes comms accelerator with Linux, and does
Linux support it ?  reading the blurb on the side of the box
yesterday, it say its a 16550 COMPATIBLE board that is capable
of support 115200 data rates.

Its also billed as a windows 3 comms accelerator.

Thoughts anybody ?

Even DOS and Windoze require administration.  It doesn't get done, and that's
why most DOS/Windoze machines are a MESS.  Stray files, improperly configured
software, lost temporary files taking up disk space.  What a waste of money
and resources...

        That's hard to say...  I heard that OS/2 is a pretty huge operating
system (yeah, like Linux isn't :), so I can only speculate on how much you
can alter Drive 0.  If you must keep a lot of DOS stuff installed, you'll
probably need to leave that drive alone.

        Drive 1 should be 100% Linux, though...  But even that much space
won't be enough for a really good system.  If you have 8 megs of RAM, you'll
probably want to have at least a 5 meg swap partition (that's what I have,
and so far it's worked pretty well); if you have less than 8 megs of RAM
you'll need a bigger swap partition.  Also, for future upgrading purposes,
you'll want a separate root partition (I haven't set one of these up myself
yet, but I would imagine that 5 megs would be pretty good).  Soooo...

        That would make Drive 1 split as such:

5 meg swap partition
5 meg root partition
90 meg Linux partition

        With that setup, you'll probably be able to squeeze in the Linux
source tree (essential), gcc (essential, but the debugger stuff and
translators can be skipped if you want), and possibly even a decent
X-Windows setup with TeX, Ghostscript, and most of the other frilly things
that make X-Windows as way-cool as it should be.  That won't leave much open
space, though; I'd recommend losing some of the DOS partition on Drive 0
(perhaps put the root and swap partitions there...  Better yet, lose DOS
altogether and make that a Linux drive... :).

        That's about it for me.  I'm sure some people would argue that the
above isn't a good split, but to each his/her own.

I have a 486/33 with 8MB. My card is a WD Rocket (so my X sever not the same).
My virtual desktop is also 3x3.

So, as you see, I don't have any swapping problems with two xterms, one idle
and one running nn. Maybe it's your X server the memory pig.

I am right now doing a test with 5 xterm open, running nn, vi, joe, dos and 
top. And dos is running MicroEmacs for dos. I also have the xfm-1.3 file 
manager open. The swapping is almost not noticeable, very smooth indeed.

This is what top shows:

So, I am happily writing this article in an xterm. Try something similar in
OS/2. I used to have it installed, but 8MB is barely the minimum, and when it
starts swapping, it seems as if it will never end. Linux, on the other hand,
just swaps a little when I move to another window, but it's just a few seconds.

Subject: 56.6 Kb simulated with 2 28.8Kb modems. Is it possible?
Date: 23 Sep 1994 04:00:08 -0400

I just had this idea. There must be a way to simulate a 56.6 Kb connection
without the need unconventional equipment (from the home user point of view,
I mean). May be with just 2 28.8 modems connected to 2 regular phone lines and
some smart low level packet routing ( choosing for a packet the least busy 
line) it has to be possible. It will be way much cheaper than the special
56.6 circuits, and it could even encourage the vendors of those equipments to
lower the price, given the cheap alternative.
So, whats your opinion. It has to be possible. Writing a whole operating 
system was much more difficult and it has been accomplished. This is just a
small retouch.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'

Subject: monitor ptrace process & read from pipe or socket
Date: Sat, 24 Sep 94 11:59:01 GMT

To monitor a ptrace'd process, I must use wait() on it. To manage
the user interface of my program, I must monitor pipes and sockets.
I do that with "select". Is it possible to do a select that
will terminate when there is something available (being
sure that wait() won't block.

Currently I manage to achieve this using two processes. The main
one do wait(), and the child do select. Whenever the select
return something useful, the child send a signal to the parent,
effectivly terminating the wait(). The parent then read the different
pipe and socket and send a signal to the child so it can resume
select().

Is it possible to do this with a single process ?

==============================================================
I am including a small information on my project in any case.

I am building a debugger for linux (GUI). This debugger
unlike most, do not rely on getting all its
symbolic information from the executable file. Instead it rely on it
only for getting a basic map of the different modules composing
the program. When information is needed on a specific module, its
corresponding source file and object file are located and
information is then read from there.

Why one would do this ? General performance!

The executable file is made with "partly" stripped library (strip -S).

        So it is smaller and link faster.
        lib file are also smaller (not a duplication of all
                the full object files content), again help link faster.

        load faster: Only the basic map of the exe must be read.

        Use less memory: Only the module which are effectivly traced
                need to be load in memory.

To give you an idea. The program I usually work on is 2.5 megs
large. The executable file with basic symbolic info is 3.2 megs large.
If linked with all symbolic info, it goes to 15-20 megs. No way one
will debugged this using a standard debugger on a 16 megs ram machine.
Even if you have the ram, the general performance of a debugger is
weak (slow). It requiere somewhere around 32 megs of swap to operate.

With my debugger, it used around 1.5 megs of ram to operate and it let
me debugged anywhere in the program without restriction.

Anyway, this is my project!

Easy: because I write my thesis faster with emacs and LaTeX than with MS-Word
or whatever you may think of.

I have written my diploma thesis with LaTeX and am going to write my PhD
thesis with LaTeX as well. Having seen lots of colleagues fiddling with
Word or WfW I never would want to change :-)

FYI, LaTeX as well as Emacs are probably better tested than any of the
commercial packages, because the source is available, so, if an error
occurs, a capable person can trace it down and send a bugfix or at least
a detailed bug report to the maintainer. As far as I can remember, the
2.* TeX package is almost bug-free (Don Knuth offered a price to anybody
who could track down a bug in TeX); I am not sure if this is also true
of the new TeX 3.* versions.

Sorry, I had to get this off my chest.
