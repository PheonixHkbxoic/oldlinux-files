can anyone tell me, how i setup gs to print every second page ?
The idea is to print first the front-sides of the paper an the the
back-sides, to make it look like a book.

   Oh, i think it would be great.But i must say too, that my knowlege of
   Linux and X isn't big.I've start with linux since about two month.At
   the moment i tried to connect my two machines :-)
   But if you start such discussion it maybe would very helpfull for me.

Subject: Yggdrasil & X: What are VGA "clocks"?
Date: 13 Oct 1994 22:03:22 -0400

I keep getting asked this question while trying to install an X server for
my video card.  No matter what I do here (ie. hit enter to accept the
default as it suggests), the monitor can't sync to the video.  I've tried
different values that are all over the map (20 - 135) with no luck.

The yggdrasil docs are no help.

I'm running an ATI Mach64 video card with a 3yr-old 1024x768i monitor that I
have no docs for.  The standard vga16 server works fine, anything else
(incuding auto-detect, ati, mach64, etc) all cause the monitor to fizzle...

How can find out what value(s) I need to specify?

**NOTICE SHARP INCREASE!!**

Notes :  I've noticed this problem for a while now, but I haven't done
         anything about it until I realized that my compile times were
         taking WAY to long, and (sigh) DOOM was unplayable.  It is not
         reported in the load average information of course.

         Other problems I've found is that it will conflict with some
         of my low-irq devices, such as my Sound Blaster on IRQ 7.  If
         I am catting a sample to /dev/dsp1 (The Sound Blaster device
         when using a ProAudio Spectrum 16) the sample will pop, skip,
         and jump, and eventually I'll get an IO error with the DSP,
         and the process will die.  I have noticed this problem with
         the original Sound Blaster as well (before I upgraded to the
         PAS 16).

         I have tried compiling the kernel to use the Bus Mouse on
         other IRQs, including 3, and 4.  The problem follows the
         IRQ, and can be seen in procinfo.

         In general, I don't notice any mouse jumpy-ness in either
         X Windows, or under Selection.  However, under selection,
         I do notice severe problems controlling the mouse when I
         am catting to /dev/dsp1.  It will ignore half of my
         requests.

         Procinfo does not show any increase as long as nothing is
         using the mouse.  ie, X isn't running, or selection isn't
         running.  But the second they startup whether or not I move
         the mouse, it climbs *fast*.

         Under DOS v6.2 with Logitechs Driver, and Under Windows AND
         OS/2 v2.1, v2.11, v2.99 (WARP 2 BETA) AND
         NeXT STEP v3.1, v3.2 I don't notice any problems with the
         mouse.

         - DX2/66 VLB 20 MB RAM
         - Adaptec 1540 IRQ 11/330h (attached to)

My minicom (on Fall94) came configured with a bad flag to the upload and 
download protocols. Jsut go into configuration mode as root and change 
the upload and download command strinsg to remove the flags.

Its worth noting, though that i have had on and off problems oin other 
systems and with other terminal programs with Y and Z modem.  It seems 
not all implementers agrred %100 on what the specs meant.  (Xmodem is 
simpel enough that it ALWAYS seems to work.)  BUT I've been doing Z modem 
just fine bringing stuff down from netcom to my Y-Fall94 system with 
minicom, so I don't think its the Linux protocol thats bad...

>2.) xmodem downloading adds a few hundred bytes to 


We used to have a problem similar to this on the Amiga. Xmodem by 
definition pads the last block if it doesn't fit exactly.  Normally this 
is not a problem, but on the Amiga there is a checksum at the end of 
executables.  we had a program we used on the amiga that trimmed off any 
trailing nulls after a download.

Okay. I'm sorry your favorite editor isn't there. Its worth noting that i 
use vi NOT because I love it, but because I CAN be gauranteed all UNIX 
systems have it.  If you are going to chose to use another editor, you 
ARe going to run into vanilla UNIX installations that don't have your 
editor. Grab it off of an ftp site and recompile.

I assume you are talking about using the DOSEMU emulator, sicne no one 
woudl expect dos EXE files to run natively under Linux.  I'm afraid i 
can't help you tehre 'cause I haven't used it.

I'm VERY confused. getty is your tty handler. How does this pertian to 
doing downloads?  I'm obviously not following you...

Assumign thsi is a supported driver, if you are properly configured, you
should be able to ping.  Are you using the proper ip number?  if you are
trying to ping by host name, have you configued you hosts file?  Network 
setup under UNIX takes a little bit of twiddlign with files.

This is just plain silly.  I'm sorry, but tehre is NO WAY Yygdrasil can 
put ALL available Linux software on the PnP disc.  Just because a 
HOW-TO or informational sheet included in the bible mentioend 
something does NOT mean yygdrasil is supplying it.  if you read the 
intro at the front of the bible, you will find it contains 3 basic 
types of information:
        a) One version of the yygdrasil manual (whichever was current when it 
           was printed.)
        b) various HOW-TO guides from the net.
        c) variosu docs from the Linux documentation project.
Of these, ONLY A is specific to the yygdrasil release.

Sure there are.  Use install_component on the x11progs package.  I admit 
that the list of what i in this pckage coudl have been a little mroe 
detailed, but it really shouldn't have been THAT hard to take an educated 
guess at given the names of all the other components in NO way 
referencing X.  Also, thsi info has been nadided abotu here alot.  BTW; 
You DO have the rrata sheet, don't you?  if not, pop over to the 
yygdrasil ftp site and get it.

I've installed the networkj software and it instaleld and runs just fine. 
Currently, I'm onyl using one station, but I'm using telnet and the 
socket supprot locally.  Nexst month I'm going SLIp and I really don't 
expect any problems.

Again., did you get the errata?  If not, I wouldn't be suprised if you 
got NOTHING instaleld correctly since there is a specific peice of errata 
regarding one packeage (userbin) that MUSt be installed first from the 
command line before you can use the X based installer.

>10.) MS-DOS MSCDEX will not activate CDROM properly,

Tell us more abotu your problem, like what errors you see, and maybe we

i have no idea what UW 1.1 AS is, but you clearly have a corrupted image 
of the revision B floppy on your disk, as it works fine for me.

If you like, I will send you a uuencoded copy of my 3in revB boot floppy
(which came from the yygdrasil ftp site) and a uuencoded copy of my
rawwrite.exe (which came right off of the Fall94 CD-ROM).  I have sent 
these to many other people who have had no trouble using them.

If I can be frank for a moment, it looks to me like most of your
insurmountable hurdles regard your own knowledge and expectations.  All
the sfotware you cited as 'missing' are not in general in commercially
realesed UNIX installations.  Thats what the net is for. Most of your 
'defects' are unique to your situation, many others have had no trouble 
with these features, particularly after following the instructions in the 
errata sheet.


It IS concievable that you have some very weird hardware that is causing 
some of your problems, but as you give NO specifics as to exactly how the 
sofwtare creashes and what it prinst out, tehres not much anyone can do 
to help you.

I disagree, at least about TeX, groff etc ``not  cutting'' it in terms
of effectiveness.   That's simply a non-truth.   What we /may/ need is
some kind of  ``front-end'' for those  who don't want the nitty-gritty
of dealing with  TeX directly.    Let's be  frank, what WYSIWYG   word
processor for  other platforms   has  the full functionality  of  TeX?
Admittedly, I used Ventura Publisher  as a word-processor for a while,
I but asside from /that/...

It should be /far/ easier to create a system that backends onto TeX or
groff, depending on  one's tastes (and  which can /read/ those formats
as well,  that's important in  an environ  that  passes them around in
themselves),  and which can use the  tools of  power already extant to
build  on.  Creating  something   from scratch seems  to  /me/   to be
rebuilding the wheel rather than simply making it look snazzy.

Of course, for my money I use Emacs on the LaTeX front, as little as I
know, and keep wishing it had a groff-mode too.  :)
