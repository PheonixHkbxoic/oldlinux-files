[all stuff deleted]

All this talk about DOOM in X-windows, and nobody saying anything of
where it can be obtained?

Where is it?

Does it run at acceptable speed (I have 50MHz486, 8MB RAM, CLGD5428,
Linux 1.09)?

Thanks

I just downloaded linuxdoom, it is very fast.
Using the shareware version doom1.wad, it seems to be much faster under linux
than dos. The problem is I used to play it with the mouse, now I can only
use the keys. 

I am runing it in the following enviroment:
 DX2/66, 12MB, ISA Bus, VGA monitor, 1MB video ram, fvwm.

Date: Tue, 13 Sep 94 07:23:37 PDT


I'm running Linux 1.1.49 and attempting to configure it as a router between my 
local Ethernet and my Internet provider. I've posted on this before but maybe I 
posted it in the wrong place (in fact, I'm almost sure I did!)

Network Architecture:

Symptoms:
        After booting Linux, my Windows box can access Linux w/o problems
        Confirmed that CONFIG_IP_FORWARDING is defined in kernel
        After starting PPP
                routing tables are updated, default route = term server
                Linux can access the net w/o problems using the default route
                Internet hosts can access Linux w/o problems
        However, neither local or internet hosts can access a machine on the
                far side of the Linux box being used as a router.
        I can see the incomming packets being counted in /proc/net/dev, but I 
                never see packets being sent out the other interface.

I've tried to reach the linux-activists mailing list without success, and for 
some reason I cannot subscribe to comp.os.linux.help even though my news server 
 is supposed to have the group. So this seems to be my last resort.

Would someone running as near to an identical configuration as this PLEASE 
email me as to how their system is configured. If I can't get this resolved in 
short order, I'm going to have to trash Linux and look for another routing 
solution. (And to think I was so impressed with Linux to begin with.... Well... 
I still am... BUT THIS IS FRUSTRATING!). Additional information on my 
configuration by email only. I'll post the solution if it seems to be of 
general interest.

        Thanx in advance

I'm thinking of upgrading my video card to a VRAM based PCI card.  I'm looking
at possibly getting the new Matrox Impression 2+, which is a bit 
expensive but has some built-in 3D capability and a socket to add a 
motion video decompression chip. 

Is there any Linux support for this card or other Matrox cards?  (No need
to support the 3D stuff or the video decompression... I just want to be
able to run X on it).

Failing that, what Linux-supported PCI video cards would folks 
recommend?

Go and get "andrew" from sunsite. It's wysiwyg, it's good, it's fast, and it's
for free.

sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/X11/andrew/...

The package is divided into several parts. You need at least the basic part
"auis63L1-wp.tgz" which is the wordprocessing stuff (and is unfortunately
20k to big to fit on a single disk).

Yeah, it is my setting problem; linuxxdoom flies after I commented out the

Several people have responded to my original question:

What split window / multi-window management tools are out there for
dumb terminals for starting several tasks with their output sent
to a seperate scrolling window.  I'd prefer support for up to 3 windows
being managed.

The answers were:

BSD's: window tool; window.tar.Z on many BSD archives.  Unfortunatly it's
a hack to get this to compile and actually run on SVSV.

Has anybody ported BSD's window to SYSV, SVR4.2??

Splitvt; The latest version is 1.5.6 on unix.hensa.ac.uk in the Linux,
terminal stuff dir; splitvt-1.5.6.tgz

The above tool is supposed to manage 2 windows (split)...  I've yet to
attempt to unpack and compile on SVR4 so no insights yet.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks so far, please mail responses to: cgi@crl.com

OK, I decided to checkout the competition.  I see TIA is only
supported on 386bsd, bsdi, spark.solaris, and spark.sunos.  So
even if I wanted to I couldn't buy your program.  Anyways I'm
sure I'll have the linuxxdoom binary patched for term support
by the end of this week.  (Although a recompiled version would
be alot better.)  So you term users, get your practice
now.  Anyways, I haven't tried TIA so don't take this as an
endorsement, or an anti-endorsement...  If they ever do a 
TitanOS port, I'd love to give it a spin and see if by interphasing
to the SLIP/PPP driver they have bypassed any of the problems that
have been driving me crazy.

Try pressing '-'.  You probably just expanded the view window to

Date: 13 Sep 1994 13:15:30 GMT


Hi !

Just to add my point of view (as a very satisfied WPWin-user) to this threat:

- I would love to see WP for Linux at a reasonable price

- Since most of the Linux-boxes are stand-alone PC's, a non-network version would
   be sufficient.

- In todays world, not only sales are important but also the percentage of the
  market (sp ?). It should be in Novells/WordPerfects intention to spread as much
  versions of WP in the market as possible (I mean selling at reasonable price -
  - not giving away for free ). One big advantage of WP visa MS-Word is IMHO the 
  availability of WP on different platforms. 

My conclusion:

Novell should make a Linux-only, no-network version of WP available at a price
comparable to a DOS/Windows version (including students discounts). The Linux
community could profit by getting more acceptance for Linux because of a native
port of WP. And Novell/WP could profit by aquiring a new, relativly closed 
market with no competitor at all. And it would increase the Unix-based
WP-user-base as well (esp. if Linux gets ported to other platforms like MIPS,
Alpha, PowerPC, 68x00, ...).

Any Opinions ?

See my posting in comp.linux.admin.  The reason youneed a window manager
is probably color reservation and management since doom grabs most of the
available colors.

Or simply remap the meta/special keys in the window manager of your choice.
I believe the setup file is in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults

        I have two written legal opinions that since the GPL licenses 
everyone to use the software, your software would only be distributed to 
licensed users of all the GPLd code. Therefore, you have nothing to worry 
about.

        It has one : alt.games.doom
                  I agree : don't post DOOM articles in the comp.os.linux.*
hierarchy. You make me sick ! I only have a 386 DX-25 with 4 Mb RAM,
so I don't hope I can run DOOM here. Please go to alt.games.doom, or
I'll just go CRAZY ! :-)
