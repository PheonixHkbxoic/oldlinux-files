I suggest using the shell builtin "limit" or "ulimit" to tell the process
how much memory you want it to use. Of course said process would have
to handle failure of malloc() in a sensible manner.

I have a laptop that I run in 640x480 using XF86_VGA16 and a small enough
font that I don't notice the cramped resolution. Works like a champ.

For running DOOM, I use the XF86_SVGA server and chipset "generic"
with a stock VGA 320x200 modes line:
"320x200"       25      320 344 376 400         200 204 206 225

You can simply run the server, without any clients, and start linuxxdoom
on a VT. Looks very nice!

If seeing the commands the user issued is what you want, just patch the

Nah.  root don't need no stinking password!  Just "su" to the other user as

It's unfortunate that this topic has generated so much heat.  I can't
claim to know what was in anyone's mind while posting a note but the
tenor of the accusations that appear to be flying in this thread is
wildly incongruous with the open, helpful, discreet role the

Well, note that certain additional disclaimers have been added in the

I believe, even more than the legal issues (and they are there,
indiscriminate application of an unmodified GPL or LGPL would certainly
bring them out), I do have problems with depending on the "largesse" of the
FSF people to somehow always make exceptions.  It's a bad idea.  Having the
FSF "take over" Linux, or WINE, or what-have-you, conveys no real advantages
and has the disadvantage of involving what might be well on its way towards
becoming a software bureaucracy.  No offense intended to anyone.  :)

Sorry, but you're wrong.  The Linux kernel, for example, adds additional
disclaimers which modify the GNU-format license it is used under.

Also, a GNU license which is owned by FSF would be enforced by FSF (at least
FSF would attempt to enforce its license as it saw fit, which could
certainly be a nuisance at times, and which would probably change the
emphasis of Linux licensing.).

GNU software *has* received recognition for being GNU software. 
Nonetheless, the Linux itself was not written by FSF, has a modified GPL,
and could be packaged in a distribution which did not include FSF software
(and, I think, has been, at early stages of its development).  It would
still remain Linux.  FSF software without Linux would just be, um, FSF
software, wouldn't it? ;)

I have no problem with RMS stating his views in any way he sees fit. 
Nonetheless, I believe too close an association with FSF would not
especially profit Linux.

The wad file is the shareware version, and thus is fully legal. If you're

I know XV can do it, I really want something that will quickly display a

XV or shutdown the current one to load a new picture. And I don't want 
all of those images in RAM at once, which is what happens when that 
method is used. Just a quick and dirty slideshow program.

First, make sure that your RAM is configured in "Linear Mode" as opposed

/usr/src/linux/init/main.c.  Locate the function start_kernel() and
hardwire the value of memory_end to 24*1024*1024.  Relink and reboot

Does 8 bit sound work *at all*?  I have the Soundblaster Pro, and when
I start it up, it says, could not initialize 16 bit sound (or something
similar).  When I run sndserver by itself, it goes through and
says could not find certain 16 bits sound images in doom1.wad.  But it
does click the speaker.  It doesn't do that just with linuxxdoom.

In the post on comp.os.linux.announce (but nowhere else) there was
mention of a certain required sound driver.  Could this be the problem?
I assume this was just the kernel sound driver or was it additional
software?  I have all the latest kernels.

I really love the program, though, and I had never played the game before
yesterday.
