Because of the audience. Typical conversation.

(NU: Newbie User, LE: Linux Enthusiast)

Senario after a brand new Linux installation on NU machine.

LE: See. With Linux you can have multiple users, multiple tasks, all at the
    same time.
NU: Ok where is the Wordprocessor?
LE: Well all I have to do is get the IBSC2 package and install it. It's on
    tsx-11.mit.edu. Oh Oh we don't have a net connection from here.
NU: So you mean it doesn't have a wordprocessor?
LE: No it just has to be installed. WordPerfect runs fine.
NU: Well there's a copy of Windows 6.0 Wordperfect on the DOS disk. Run that.
LE: Well I can't because Linux doesn't run windows applications.
NU: What about DOS then?
LE: Sure. The DOS emulator runs all DOS applications. But I'll have to install
    the emulator. Hmm. That's on sunsite. I can get a floppy with it tomorrow.
NU: So your telling me that Linux has no Wordprocessor unless you add something
    else that you don't have with you. It's too complicated. Take it off my
    machine.

Note that this is a paraphrased conversation I've had with a couple of
new users.

Point being that Linux does need a native wordprocessor that doesn't depend
on emulation.

Yes it does. Linux needs to have its own native apps just like all the other
systems have their own native apps. It'll run faster, requires much less
setup, and most improtantly it can be free so that it can be distributed with
the disk.

Now it doesn't have to be anything fancy. In fact I've taken a cursory look
at HWP and it's about 1/2 to being perfectly usable.

Most WP users don't use all the "kitchen sink" fancy features that most
products tout. Usually it's just formatting (centering, indentation, bullets)
and style (font type, size, and bold,italic,and underlined) along with a
simple way to specify these things. I mean anyone who can use the function
keys for WordPerfect should be thrilled with a simple Point and Click 
interface. 

How hard can it be to develop something like this? All the basic tools are
already available:

- Text editor with color highlighting (JED)
- A mouse package that can be integrated into the editor (the selection
  replacement that sends events to applications in addition to performing
  all of selection's original functions)
- Popup menu support (dialog)
- Any number of formatters. I prefer QuikScript because it compresses
  the format/reder step into one step. However TeX or nroff could be used.
- A renderer, GhostScript, that works with almost any graphics printer. 
- A previewer, GhostView/GhostScript, So that you can see what it looks like 
  before you print. Note that Ghostscript can display on a normal Linux
  console.

All this software already exist. All it really needs is a couple of
enterprising people to pull it all together into a single package.

As I have stated before I cannot by that person because I'm embroiled
(actually it feels like being broiled) in my PhD research. I'll be happy
to suggest a plan, coordinate efforts, and of course test. But as to
actually doing it as much as I'd like to I can't right now.

The above elements can be used to put together a functional product. The only
thing that's missing is any hint of WYSIWYG. For a text version this would
primarily consist of highlighting attributed text, showing some form of
indentation/centering, and most importantly when the font size/style changes
accurately showing the characters on each line and the lines on each page.

Obviously for the X version a more sophitcated product is needed. But I point
out the the EZ Wordprocessor performs many of the functions in a X environment.
It's native and freely available. However it doesn't do diddly for a virtual
console, telnet session, or a terminal session. That's why I'm suggesting that
we focus in that direction.

The fundamental question is how the buffer is going to be implemented---
what will the data structure look like.  Fundamentally, a word processor and
an editor are very different.  I suspect that the best choice for a data
structure for the WP would consist of a linked list of paragraphs.  Perhaps
the paragraph should be implemented as a buffer gap. Also, how will the
character attributes be stored?  Should we store an attribute with each
character?  Should the data structure consist of a parallel stream of
attributes?  Questions like this are going to be fundamental to the
development of the WP.  I suspect that it is NOT a good idea to integrate an
existing editor into the WP.

The user interface should be fairly simple to implement.  For example,
consider my S-Lang library.  It already has routines for multiple keymaps,
keyboard tty input, Screen Managment Facility (with color), etc...  In fact,
much of JED is interfaced to this library.  The rest of JED consists of
routines to handle its representation of the buffer.  Finally, I am also
working on a Text based window library for S-Lang.  One could incorporate
this library into the WP to handle windows, Scroll bars, dialog boxes,
etc... to make it look pretty.

But, the fundamental question remains:  What will the representation of the
buffer look like?

Finally, is this project worth doing?  How well does DOSEMU run Wordperfect?
Can it run Wordperfect over a serial line?  If we ever do get a WP for Linux
off the ground and functional, will it be better than Wordperfect running
under DOSEMU over a serial line?   (I am emphasising serial line because I
would like to use something like it remotely from, e.g., a vt100)

Eh? The LaTeX package I dowloaded included support for several African
languages, Gothic (a medieval rune system), Both of the Futharks,
several versions of Tolkien's alphabets, Hebrew, Georgian, a couple
of languages somebody probably just made up and God knows what else.

I challenge you to name an alphabet that doesn't have at least some

Reply-To: hseaver@nyx.cs.du.edu

   I'm doing a class project to try to convince various grade and high
school officials that they would be much smarter to buy a 586 and 100
dumb terminals and run Linux/Xwindows/Motif than buying 100 macs. Or even
just running Linux in text mode, since mostly what school computers are
used for is just word processing anyway, and have a few macs or whatever
for the other stuff. 
   So here's my question: How much RAM and how much swap space does a 586
need (or a 486 even) to run 100 terminals, either in text mode or Xwin
mode?  And can I even run Xwin on dumb terminals? Also, does anyone know
of any good cheap vga res terminals w/color? Last time I looked, a few
years ago, the cheapest was about $800. Also, what would you use for 
ports for that many terminals?

Thanx.

You can use the ange-ftp package for Emacs or even Mosaic ... Seriously,
there is something like a ftp filesystem as a sample in the userfs package.

Agreed, but that wasn't the question.  I believe  the question was whether
dosemu could handle, perhaps, Windows 3.0 in real mode.  I thought I read that
the answer was yes.  Whether that would be acceptable or not is another
question.

As far as Wine goes, there was a great deal of progress being made a few months
back, more and more things were running, and those that were were running 
better all the time.  That seems to have slowed down now, which is a shame.

But, it is a difficult project.  You probably know that WABI, which inspired
wine, also is limited in the number of app's it can run (I believe I saw
an ad suggesting some dozen or so programs that were certified to run).

I also don't think the benchmark of success with wine should be write or
solitaire, either, but the kinds of product that would enable more people to
leave the Gates behind, like WP/windows, Quicken, Lotus.  With the advent of
iBCS, which allows us to use SCO, etc., binaries, and commercial linux
programs like Maple, there is less of a push in that direction, and with
MS acquiring Quicken, they will push ever harder to make their software
unworkable on anything but their own system.

Unfortunately it's elitist. My lab has 50 vt-320 terminals and no
X-terminals. So my students who would use such a product are out of luck.

I'm typing this from a Linux box with a CGA card and original issue
IBM PC Color Display. Am I not worthy of this product?

Not to bend over backwards but to realize that a single interface cannot
solve all the problems.

Have both. Enhance the X version.

I've been using WP 5.1 for sco unix with linux and Xfree 2.1 for about
a month with no real problems. 

I recently tried to upgrade to XFree 3.1. When I tried out WP, it gave
give me lots of Xm* error and then wold give me a  seg violation. One time it
cause my HD to do *something* for about 1/2 hour. I ended up rebooting

Well it _is_ possible if you only have two OS's to switch between. You can put 
MS-DOS as the first OS in lilo.conf and Linux as the second one. There is an 
option in LILO (don't remeber which one now... it's in the readme anyway) 
which enables to select which OS to boot next, but only once. In other words, 
LILO would boot the (this way) selected OS, and boot the standart first OS in 
any other subsequent bootup. If you now put this command in rc.local, each 
time you'd boot Linux, it would set-up Linux as next boot default. If you now 
select DOS, you'd override this setting, and any subsequent bootup would boot 
the default OS, which is DOS. This has worked fine for me for almost a year 
now.
