This is interesting...

I have Walnut Creeks simtel20 CD...
It non-rockridge.

find . on linux just list the files in the current directory and nothing
more...

ls -lR recurses down.

find on Ms-Dos (djgcc find) works fine.

Your implicit assumption and that of most other posters in the preceding
thread is that such newsgroups must be under the Big7 i.e. comp.*. 

Drop that assumption and create _regional_ groups. There are two
that I know of, i.e. aus.computers.linux and de.comp.os.linux. I don't
get the former one except via crosspostings, but I do read the latter
one. 

de.c.o.l is a German _language_ newsgroup, so the potential audience
and the number of postings is much smaller than in the Big7, albeit
growing. As the average number of jerks per million people is sort
of a global constant, Usenet/Internet access does cost about three
times as in the USA, and the telephone rates are high and growing
due to privatization, the absolute number of clueless postings is 
smaller, which has consequences for the group culture. 

So create groups like {uk,sbay,ne,whatever}.comp.os.linux and make these 
regional groups known by whatever legal means. Additional benefit is 
that there is a larger chance that people may reply not only with advice, 
but also by "if you have further questions, phone me on (local call)".
Due to telephone rates, such an offer from (say) ...gatech.edu or 
...ac.uk would be meaningless for me in .de, and probably vice versa.

It's quite a different story (for me :-) if the telephone number starts
with 0049-23...

Mind the .sig ;-)

I saw a bunch of readdir() for each entry in the CD -- and find treated

Isn't readdir a user library call -- on Linux is a system call?

Lots of good info, thank you, Paul.  If you REALLY want to help out, it 
might not be a bad idea to send that info to Yygdrasil, so future users 
of your card or setup don't have the problem.  I got rid of my OS/2 when 
I installed Linux, and i use LILO, so if there IS a problem there I never 
would have seen.  I doubt fdisk is th issue, for the reasons you already

There is a new 'cfdisk' in the Fall94 release, but you can always fall

Oh c'mon Pual. Now YOU'RE acting smug.  You just made a mistake about the

In case you are interetsed, what happend here was that my fingers cominbed
    umount /system_cd
with
    umount /dev/sony_cd
Obviously, either will work as long as /dev/sony_cd is in the mount table.

Yes. It works GREAT!  Maybe my system is blessed, but WITh it mounted I 
get all the extra stuff, with the associated delays for CD-ROm based 
searches before it decides it can't find it.  Without it mounted, it just 
doesn't find all this stuff, and searches much faster.  I use both modes

Sure, I've read it alot.  But I haven't actually heard one person before 
you say that when they unmounetd the drive they still had a problem.  
All the stuff I've read has had to do with situations with the drive 
mounted.  (If anyone out there DOES have experiences different then 
mine when they umoutn the drive PLEASE share them!)

Right, but they don't point to anything and don't do anything.  No che

Yes, a light just came on that you are lookign at something TOTALLY 
different from what we are talkign about.  You just decided you WANT to 
try to access stuff you havent installed, with the CD-ROM unmounted.

If you find a system that can do this PLEASE let me know.  Myself, i 
instaleld everything i want to use on my HD on my HD, and mount my CD-ROm 
only when I want to see something that I didn't put on my HD.  When i 
DON'T want to do that, i remove the CD-ROM and the linksc ause me zero 
hassle.

What are you asking for, the ESP operating system???

(I';m sorry, but this is a VERY silly point and TOTALLy tangential to the 
issue of whether links on your HD that point to an unmounted CD-ROm are 
detrimental.)

>
>If the links are there, then you don't have a CD-ROM-less install.

:: sigh:: see all the above.  ONCE more, what you have is a partial 
install of wehatever you wanted on the HD with access to the rest with 
just a mount offo f the cd.  This is exactly what I wanted.  if its not 
what you wanted, then you obviously bought the wrong disc.  if you feel 
this was falsely advertised, then CALL them and complain!

HOW?  You've made this assertion many times but have yet to point out 1 
harm from these links.  Pleas explain or drop the point.
>programs are going to blow up and the target Yggdrasil user you defined

Again, nothign random lows up on my system. ALL the files neede for the 
stuff I installed on the HD are on the HD. ALL the files forstuff on the 
CD are on the CD.  Nothign blows up becuase either:
a) The program is on the HD, and so are its files
or
b) The program is still on the CD alogn with its files, and thus CANNOT 
be accessed unless said CD is mounted.

Where's the beef?  I honestly think you are inferring problems from a lack 
of understanding as to how the system works.

It sounds to me like you have a specific hardware problem.  Obviously it 
is difficult to test a Linuyx distribution on all hardware supported.  I 
ha a specific hardware problem (the sony cd bug).  I called them and 
within a week they had the patch available.  Did you call them with your 
problem?

I think, perhapse, that was indeed what you intended and i commend you.  
I aslo think your heat on thsi issue and your general assumption 
(repeated over and over in this discussion) that your persdonal 
experience was a generally applicable one.  Plus your frustration over 
soem issues leading you to not fully explore others, such as  the CD-ROM 
links issue, got the best of you and slanted your post badly.

Correct me if I am wrong, but this sounds like summer94, yes?
I ask because the install changed a GREAT dall in Fall94.  i had some 
misgivings abotu the sumemr version myself.  The fall version acts more 
liek my old SCO installer in that it installs a base 10 meg system and 
then its up to you.  They still provide the X based installer if you want 
it, but X doesnt install on the HD automatically.  They also provide a 
simpel command line install_component command that lets you install 
things major package at a time.

I like this much better then the old 4-install-choices system they sued 
to have and feel it works alot smoother (I don't use X either ;)  )

If you have any interest in it, since this is free-ware, you coudl borrow 
a friends and have a look at it.  On the other hand, if you are happy 
with your Slackware, why switch?

The book from O'Reilley is good for configuring Tex, but it doesn't 
cover hardly _any_ issues in using TeX (like how to do left and
right justification)

I heard that AMD's version is more reliable than Intel's, and that many
people have overclocked it to 80 MHz with no problems.  There was even
a rumor going around that AMD would start to sell them as 486DX2-80's.
If you see an AMD 486DX2-80 system for sale, I guess the rumor is true.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !
