I've just realized that when I used Ctrl-Z at ANY time, I get an
unresponsive VC as a result.  I have to go to another VC, and
kill the first VC.  This problem is driving me nuts.  Has anyone
had any similar experiences?

Just because your program is running does not mean that the code file
is still addressable under the name that you have in argv[0]. The argv
vector is simply that -- arguments. There is absolutely no requirement
that argv[0] even contain the name of the program. Several programs
even use it for an additional argument.

Let's face facts. UNIX is not MSDOS. You are not alone in the computer. An
other program running in the system may change the configuration information
which will make the data in argv[0] meaningless.

[BTW, this facility did not exist in MSDOS until 2.0. The file name is
not in the argument string. It is in a different area of memory --
tacked on to the end of the environment strings.]

>The UNIX shell can be modidied to pass the full path name into a program

No, I doubt that. Passing the full name will not crash any program of
which I am aware. The UNIX programs must be written to accept full
names as well as just their own name. It is totally legal and valid to
use "fred" as well as "./fred". One has a path, one does not. (They
may not be the same program however.)

It would seem to me that you would be better to place the configuration
file in a specific location, such as the /etc directory. Then, in that file,
put the file names to the data files.

Vue runs well if you have enough ram.

But for me olvwm is a MUCH nicer environment.  Takes less ram,
more functionality for multiple workspaces.  I.e. drag windows into
different workspaces, push windows offscreen into another desktop etc.

Olvwm gives you the multiple workspaces without getting in the way
or taking up to much memory.

Of course memory use because you have more workspaces is to be expected.

Actually, both of these so-called theoretical maximum compression ratios
are nothing but simple numbers the marketing types can remember.  Both
MNP5 and V.42bis (which, btw, really is normally the better of the two)
are capable of *MUCH* higher than 2:1 or even 4:1.

I have some detailed specs somewhere, but of course, they're not in the
directory they should be in (and my copy of Recommendation V.42bis is at
work).  Of course, the numbers don't really mean much unless the data is
basically designed to be highly compressible, but....  :-)

I have been looking around for a bootdisk to set up Linux on a System with
an Adaptec AHA 2842 SCSI-Adapter.

Recently I«ve been told that one (still at the "interim-stage"?) is
available at:

   sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/linux/kernel/images/boot284x.tar.gz

Did anyone succeed to set up Linux with this bootdisk yet?

Any information is appreciated.

Dan,

I understand your feelings, I had them several months back.  However, I
didn't want to wait for Novell to fix it and did it myself.  I've posted
my "How to make `man' work better" series here (c.u.u), but I'm always
willing to sent it to whomever needs it (the reason I'm following up
instead of replying).

The series helps you to set up your environment to find all the man
system pages, the Motif man pages (assumes you have the SDK), and create
a whatis database so the apropos and man -k commands work.

So, UW does provide it them, they just need a little tweaking.  My comment
(about Linux man pages) was directed to the comments in the gcc man page
(about not bothering to keep them up to date) and the fact that some of my
commands *definitely* do not have a man page (or perhaps I retrieved an
incomplete Linux, but since 95+% of my commands have man pages, I suspect
they just weren't included in the release).

[ Note:  follow-ups changed as this is becoming UW only. ]

What SCSI host adapter do you have?  The Adaptec will remap the drive
to a drive with only 345 meg., 1 meg for every cylinder.  Just curious,
and I still don't believe that LILO can load the kernel image from a
partition which spans beyond 1024 cylinders.

It's available under a number of guises.  All of them require hacks or
extra hardware, or both.

You can get a patch (at munnari.oz.au, I believe) which adds Linux to
the list of supported CAP systems.  It configures CAP to allow IPTalk
operation on a Linux system - you'd need a FastPath-4, -3, GatorBox, or
some similar IPtalk-to-EtherTalk router to handle protocol conversion.

I was able to install CAP on my Linux system using a hacked-up version
of UAR as the network interface.  This UAR allows the CAP interfaces to
be bound to the "tnnl" DDP-in-IP tunneling interface.  I also set up UAR
on my Sun SparcStation, acting as a router between the IP tunnel and
EtherTalk Phase 2.  It's an ugly hack but it does work.

At least one group of people is working on adding native EtherTalk
support to Linux.  They've got Phase 1 partially working.

Phase 2 (which is what most organizations are using these days) will be
a more difficult capability to implement.  It requires a consistent
method of persuading the Ethernet interface to receive multicasts.  A
fair number of the current Linux ethercard drivers do not yet support
multicasting, and [as far as I can tell] there is no consistent kernel
interface for registering with the network in order to receive arbitrary
packets (e.g. there's no equivalent to the Berkeley packet filter).

Well, over 12 years of empirical evidence show that the
bogoboost technique is safe and works fine. The 500 uS refresh
timer is close to optimal on most machines. The margin of safety
is considerable.  You have achieved almost all of the boost
possible at that point. You need to go to much, much longer
delays before you experience parity errors:  about 10000 or
20000 uS.  But there is no point in pushing it to the threshold
because you gain almost no performance increase over 500 uS.

This technique is particularly well suited to older 386 motherboards.
Owners of this hardware may well want to take a look at Paul
Gortmaker's  "dram" program and squeeze a bit more performance out of
their older hardware.

There is no need to swap the 1488 and 1489, as they have no relation to
the FIFO buffering.   They are the drivers/receivers for the RS232 levels.
