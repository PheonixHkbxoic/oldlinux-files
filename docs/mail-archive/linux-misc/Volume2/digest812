Hi,

I am thinking of purchasing a 9GB seagate drive (Elite 9) for use with
Linux.

Does anyone know if this would cause a problem?

Anyone out there using big drives with Linux and regretting it?


All answers would be greatly appreciated.

um, not really, since most 486dx2/66 motherboards are in to $2-300 range,

Subject: ftape works!!
Date: 23 Sep 1994 15:00:56 GMT

I finally have ftape working reliably with my colorado 250!  Since I 
started using the newer kernels, I have had a problem with it getting 
stuck in a loop whenever it found an error on the tape. :< I am using the 
latest ftape, ftape-1.13b, and I have used every kernel to try to get it 
to work.  It would write fine, but when I would read it back to verify 
it, about 100 megs into it, it would get an error and back up and read 
again.  It would just keep doing this untill I killed the process.  I 
knew it was not the tape or drive, because it workes fine under dos.  

To get it to work, all I had to do was increase the buffers in the kernel 
to 10.  It takes a little bit of memory ( I only have 8 megs ), but it 
works.  I have created a 240 meg (two tapes) backup of compressed data, 
verified it and repeated this several time.  I have not had it loop 
once.  I also upgraded to 1.1.51 at the same time, but I don't think that 
did anything for my problem.

I am posting this, because I have heard of other people having the same 
problem.  I hope that this trick will help some other sould out there...

Wouldn't using 64-bit REAL numbers provide exact integers of at least
40 bit size?
If so, you wouldn't need any software conversion routines.

I'm trying to install Linux on my new PC. But somehow Linux has a problem

My 2nd linux HD thus also uses the LBA setting and has the same problem.
Linux just ignores both hd's. Any ideas on how to get things up and running?

The X documentation recommends a minimum of 16Mb memory (combination of
RAM plus swap space) to run well.  I understand that Emacs is also a
memory hog, and I expect that LaTeX is similar, so you probably want to
bump that up significantly.

Uhmmm...  I hate to burst your bubble, but simply "not developing" this tool

ANY disk on the system.  So the system is INHERENTLY insecure.  A much better  
security precaution is to not put any files on the system that you don't want  
damaged/stolen/viewed/etc.

Besides, if someone is _truly_ devious, _THEY_ will develop the tool  
themselves.  I say we should develop a tool that requires a password to  
access the Linux filesystems.  Certainly no more secure than the current  
system, but it will make some people feel better about themselves (and it  
could keep my 4yo kid from trashing my Linux fs...)

Pardon my ignorance...

        A bit ago I went to a class at Hewlett-Packard and the instructor said that 
on Unix fragmentation was actually a benefit, or not as much of a deterrent as 
on DOS.  The reason was since you have a multi-user system that will probably 
be accessing all sorts of files all over the place, the fragmentation helps 
out.

anyone?

IT IS ALL MY FAULT - DON'T BLAME LINUX!

Confessions of Network Administator:

I did 3 things wrong that caused all my problems with PPP and IP Forwarding:

1. DNS/BIND mismatch between my primary server, and my providers server
        My Internet Provider runs a secondary name server for my domain, and I 
made changes to my primary DNS tables (including re-assigning the IP of my DOS 
box)... BUT I FORGOT TO CHANGE THE SERIAL NUMBER IN THE DNS TABLES. The serial 
number is how secondary servers determine that DNS needs to update... So the 
two servers had different IP addresses for the same host name... OOOPPPS!

2. DOS TCPIP Routing MisConfiguration
        Netmanage Chameleon has two separate configurations for routing... the 
Default Route, and a Routing Table... I had set up an entry in the routing 
table for my Net Provider that pointed to a router that was available on the 
old network that I was connected to.. and that entry over-rode the Default 
Route that pointed to the correct router (took me 4 days to find that one) 

3. Gratituously updating Linux versions 
        My initial response to this problem was to blame Linux 1.0 and to 
attempt to install a later rev of the system (1.1.49 to be exact). This 
ofcourse created all sorts of additional problems requiring the installation of 
updated applications and utilities, which I thouroughly botched in my haste to 
get the system working as a router.... Since I found the other problems, and 
did a complete re-install of 1.0.... everything has worked fine...

Advice to the Wannabe Network Administrator:

        Erasing and application and doing a clean install may not be a bad 
idea. All of the configuration may look right.. but some leftover trash may be 
spoiling your whole day.

Request to the Linux Developers:

        I had a *ell of a time figuring out what patches and utilities went 
together to make a fully updated version of the system... Grouping the Patch 
files with the utilities required to accomodate the update would really help.

        Other than that... KUDOS TO YOU ALL... Linux is the best system I've 
worked with since I started working with MicroPort and Venix 6 years ago.. It 
certainly beats even the latest release of UnixWare in terms of ease of 
installation and loads of applications and utilities right outa the box...

        Before I shoot myself in the foot again.....

The AC3200 driver is for the Ansel Communications EISA ethercard based on a
shared memory 8390.  

It's unrelated to the NE3200, which will probably never have a Linux driver.

Both are unrelated to the Intel EtherExpress32.  I don't have any
documentation on the EE32 (or an EISA machine to develop a driver on), but
Intel might release it if you ask them.
