here's a suggestion:

Simply use one the various DOS-based archiving programs 
(zip,lha,tar,etc) to store the files using 0 compression
(i'm assuming that they are already tar-gzipped, right :)

When you later extract these files on your Linux machine,
the original filenames will have remained intact.

Amen to this!  I'm happy to have this wonderful OS to play with, regardless of any
bugs!  Bitching about free software, without helping to fix it, is like getting a
free meal and complaining about the service!  (Tho, a bug that trashed a filesystem
without warning might justify a snarl or two :-)

People with the expertise and willingness to be free software developers are heroes,
IMHO, and deserve praise and support.  Linux would be just a Minix-like toy without
their amazing collective efforts.

It's to the point now where American programmers and engineers are be-
coming dimly aware that there are other nations and languages, and that
people don't want to be constrained to using one language at a time.
But they just don't have enough familiarity with "foreign" input methods
& scripts for them to incorporate hooks for these languages into general-
ized interfaces.  They're not dumb.  It's just not part of their culture
or daily needs.

Apple has WorldScript.  Other than them, I don't know any major vendor
who's really attacked this problem head on.  I suspect that the complete
solution will come from overseas.

Had the same problems with the Mitsumi problem and Slackware. The boot disk
worked fine, but the kernal installed on the hard drive did not. The problem
was that the boot disk had a 1.0.9 (I think) kernal with the standard driver
compiled for IRQ 11 (which did not match the Mitsumi card's default setting),
while the installed kernal 1.1.18 had the extended driver, compiled for IRQ 10
(which does match Mitsumi's default). I started the install, saw the message
about not finding the Mitsumi, changed its IRQ, installed successfully, and
promptly forgot about it. A few days later, I needed to access the CD-ROM
under Linux, and spent an hour troubleshooting, before I noticed that the new
driver wanted IRQ 10 again.

Check for a similar occurance, before you switch to a possibly poorer driver.

Subject: gcc putting ptr in low memory (bug??)
Date: 17 Oct 1994 20:33:29 GMT

When building a program with the -g option gcc seems to be
placing a pointer in low memory causing a SEG violation.  I
can see the pointer address is low and as soon as the program
attempts to write to that location I get the seg signal.  The 
problem only seems to exist when using the -g option.  It's 
only doing this with one pointer which is one of several.  If
I move the pointer and make it global to the file the problem
moves to a different pointer?

I'm using gcc-2.6.0 (got it in Aug 94) Linux-1.1.52,
and Motif 1.2.4.  Does anyone have any thoughts about this?
Looks like a bug from what I can tell but I haven't been
programming in Unix very long.  Any help would be appreciated!!!

2) What is the latest version of SLS (I tried the announce newsgroup,

3) I have a DOS system with plenty of DOS apps.   Can I get the DOS emulator

(This started in c.o.l.development, D.R. Barlow redirected follups to
misc, which seems right and I'm letting it stand).

Based on the rate at which I go through problems on the software I'm
maintaining at work, I *entirely* agree with Mr. Barlow.  It is
absolutely and unambiguously *not possible* for one person to go
through 200+ daily problem reports and figure out if there's a real
problem behind each and every one of them.  Or, maybe my 25 years (as
of yesterday) in this business have rotted my brain and the young kids
of today can do it?  Naaah.

Subject: Linux working on a Thinkpad 755C!
Date: 17 Oct 1994 18:02:08 +0100


Yes, I've finally got it working!

I have a 755C with 20Mb RAM, DOCK 1, 540Mb disk.

The problems I had were :

    o The standard Slackware bootdisk doesn't work.

    o The bootdisk didn't work either, because it wouldn't recognise my
      hard disk.  It barfed because it couldn't handle the size of the
      disk.

    o The standard Linux kernel sources don't support the reversed logic
      of the disk-change sense line.

So, I created my own boot disk using a 1.1.50 kernel having modified the
sources to support the disk-change sense stuff properly.  The sources
have changed greatly since 1.0.9 on which the (reversed) patches at
peipa.essex.ac.uk are based.  They have changed again between 1.1.50 and
1.1.54, I notice.

The 1.1.50 drive correctly handled the 540Mb disk, with geometry specified
as 524,32,63 and I got everything installed from the standard Slackware
disks.  Then it was just a case of putting copying the boot kernel onto
the hard disk and running lilo to get the machine to boot from the
hard disk.

I've now got the 1.1.54 kernel built with networking support built in,
and it's running quite happily on our network :-)

If anyone want's the bookdisk/kernel image, let me know and I'll put it
up for FTP somewhere.

James.

Michael, you're not the broken record, Richard is!

> [ Goes on the describe the serious need for multilingual support. ] 

I sympathize with you (and Richard too). My proposal would have some kind of
basic multilingual support, or at least the hooks so that it could be added
on. But honestly in the multilingual crowds opinion is it possible to have
a text based multilingual support? My opinion from my limited understanding
is that it's probably not possible to do.

I'm coming to the conclusion that we're going to need multiple tools in order
to come close to solving everyone's problems:

1) A X based WYSIWYG English WordProcessor. EZ seems to fill this slot.
2) A X based WYSIWYG Multilingual WP. This product does not exist. Someone
   must write it. I have no idea how feasible it is to do? Richard, Michael?
3) A text based, non WYSIWYG English WordProcessor. This is my proposed
   application. It's definitely doable.
4) A text based, non WYSIWYG Multilingual WP. Is this possible?
 
Lastly we'll probably need a suite of conversion tools to convert existing
document formats into the formats for the above tools.

I'm almost convinced that one application cannot solve the whole problem.
I think we need to start thinking about splitting the job into multiple
tools. Let's separate the discussions by tagging the type:

(WYSIWYG, not ML)
(TEXT, not ML)
(WYSIWYG, ML)
(TEXT, ML)

in the subjects so that each group can focus on the type of WP needed instead
of arguing what features the supposed global WP needs.

We need them all people. There is no one true faith here.

Comments?

Again I agree. For example, I DON'T ask that you learn all about the
complications of entering kanji (of whatever language). This is a very
difficult area and IMO no really satisfactory solutions have even been
invented yet (at least for entering Chinese and Japanese without learning
two different systems). Asking this would be unreasonable.

I do ask that you don't just go blindly ahead without thinking about
making the system flexible enough to handle multiple languages. I may
be naive, but I don't really think it is too difficult if this is done
at the beginning of the design. If you try to add it after the program
is done, though, it is just about impossible without rewriting the whole thing.
Actually all you need to do is use good programming practices and this
flexibility will come along for free.
