On the other hand, X with Linux on my 5 meg 386-33 is unusably slowly, 
while OS/2 and PM were reasonable (though not speedy).  I have a feeling 
this has more to do with how things are tuned then any innate superiority 
of one system.  IBM has worked very hard to tune OS/2 to perform 
reasonably on low end systems. The prevailing thinking on X seems to be 
that if you can't afford at least 8 meg, then you aren't a real user.

Shame, but true.

Then tell him to buy it and use it. It seems that this is one of the
major complaints from the 'business' people that "since it did not
cost me anything then it can't be good." You should be happy with your
boss' misconception.

I would think that your boss is getting things confused. Linux will
support commercial software in the form of iBCS and Wine. However,
that has nothing to do with the operating system itself nor the status
of its availability or distribution.

p.s.: There is an old saying "the customer is always right". In business,
there is another old saying "the boss is always right." DON'T ARGUE. And
don't point out the mistake. It really doesn't matter.

Well, this is just my opinion, but.....

The way I see it, Unix is so powerful because it has all the utilities that
it has.  It is not for the faint of heart.  There is a lot to know and there
is a lot to learn, just to be a good user.  And if you're talking about a
system for home use, then, presumably, the user will also be the system
administrator, which entails a whole lot more.

This could be a problem, as single-user-mode is, by definition, root access.
Root access is something that even an experienced user should only login with
when necessary.

I suppose that this is doable, but why?  If the point is to get people to
start learing Unix, the last thing you want to do is disguise it.

Again, the utilities that Unix has are what makes it so powerful!  Don't
cripple it.

This is probably fairly harmless.  That's probably all the home user would
want anyways.

They may not know what it is, but certainly, there are lots of dos/win home
systems out there that have SCSI drives and other devices.

Why VGA16 low-res?  If you want to convince them that it's better than dos/win,
you ought to configure their system to the max posible resolution and colors,
right?  (Pretty pictures impress people! ;-))

Well, I'm not sure you'll find an intended audience.  The average Joe,
non-power-user, non-hacker, will likely not see the need for an OS such
as Unix.  And, for his use, he'll probably be right.  As for setting up a
distribution that is easier to install and get off the ground, well, that's
tough to do, simply because there are so many different cdrom/mouse/drive/
controller/video card and monitor options out there.  The installer is forced
to know something about the hardware and in many cases may have to get to the
level of knowledge where he knows the difference between IRQ5 and IRQ7. 


Here at work, we have quite a large Sun workstation installation, and lots of
users of varying levels of expertise.  Many folks, when they just start using
Unix, know enough to login and start X.  Their default startup starts X.desktop,
and they know how to use a mouse and click icons.  However, it doesn't take long
for them to find the command line, and they start picking up on basic commands
within a week or so.  (cd,mkdir,pwd,lpq,etc,etc)  My point is, these users also
have a staff of help desk folks ready to answer any questions they have, and
fix the system when things get screwed up.

In short, Unix is not an entry level OS.  It was not intended to be, and I doubt
it ever will be. 

Sorry if I sound like I blew you out of the water, but that's my opinion.  Take
it for what it's worth! ;-)

Only if the task at hand is relatively insignificant, and not
repeated often.

A clerk typist or secretary using emacs and TeX all day every day
to write business letters is not producing at maximum efficiency,
no matter how well the programs are known.  The purchase and
learning time expended on a proper word processor will quickly pay
for itself with higher productivity.

And a programmer would be well advised to learn editing with emacs
not because the next project will be done faster, but because over
a period of time productivity will be increased by matching the
best tool to a job that will be repeated many times.

However...  the secretary might once in a while want to whip out a
small program, and the word processor will handle it just fine
because it is available and well known.  Likewise a programmer can
write a single business letter with emacs a lot faster than with
some unknown fancy word processor.  Both tasks are relatively not
a significant part of what makes each person productive.

I wouldn't think that a thesis is an insignificant project to be
done up using whichever tools are familiar just because it can be
accomplished.  Learning emacs and TeX would be worth the effort to
make a thesis just that little shade higher in quality.  It would
not be something one could switch to a month before the final
version is due.
