Get a video card. Seriously - spend like $50 on a usable video card and
you'll get some sense. Tridents just seem to be _slow_.

Download the X server and get hacking. You've got source code, though anyone
who does low level SVGA programming is (IMHO) slightly short of sanity.

Nope. Source code viruses are perfectly possible, and have in fact

Besides, a Linux virus could spread in binary form, as we all have the
same binary format and machine architecture.

However, there aren't (yet) any...

Well, I and a number of other people use Linux boxes to connect to 
Demon Internet although I'm not in England.

Anyway,

If you would like to see the set up thht most of use then you can 
download teh configuration docs from

There are a couple of excellent configuration guides in there written 
by Demon subscribers, that are now rearded as the "bibles" on how to 
connect a Linux machine to demon via both SLIP and PPP.

Any further queries, please feel free to mail me. (just remember the

Subject: PCI SCSI problem
Date: Thu, 1 Sep 1994 18:29:21 GMT



I have bought a COMTRADE, 90 MHz Pentium with an unknown PCI SCSI
controller card (no commercial name appears in the booklet or in
the card) using the NCR 53c810 chip. Connected to this card is
a Quantum Empire 1080S hard disk.
I personally added a Pro Audio Spectrum 16 ISA bus, with a double
speed NEC CD ROM attached to the SCSI port.
When I try to use the LINUX Kernel 1.0 (slackware distribution
1.2), it only recognizes the NEC connected to PAS 16. The PCI
SCSI controller and the HD are not recognized.
I have read that there are COMTRADE PCs working with LINUX and
also, with problems, SCSI controllers with the NEC 53c810.
Perhaps this will depend on the LINUX Release.
- Can someone inform me about the possibility to use LINUX in
this PC ?
- I'm also looking for information about the physical
characteristics of the Quantum HD 1080S: Heads, cylinders, tracks
and sectors.
- Where are the resistor terminators in the Quantum HD and in the
NEC CD ROM?
Please send E-mail to teatro@etsit.upm.es
because I have no access to the Usenet. Thanks a lot.

Can someone in the net who have played with both CSLIP and PPP

controversial issue.  I just wish to know, comparing performance
under Linux only, which one is better? (I assume, once either

I am presently bringing up (sic - pun intended) an Xbbs system, mainly
because my American counterpart is already running it. He is running
Slackware 1.0.3 (I think). I have recently upgraded to Slackware 2.0
and am still in the throes of recovering from the upgrade.

Having spent some considerable time with Xbbs, I have been looking around
for alternatives. I have tried most of those suggested in earlier missives
(rocat, ebbs etc) and none of them really fit the bill for what I
particularly need to provide to my users. At present, I am running Wildcat
3 on a DOS box - adequate but limited as far as a TCP/IP network is
concerned !

I am looking for network _and_ modem access, with particular emphasis
on security. If there is _any_ suspicion that a user could get onto
the corporate network through the BBS then it won't even get a lookin.
My company suffered a number of network breakins (via Internet) over
the last year or so, and those who run network security are somewhat
paranoid about who can do what on the network. They are even more
paranoid about systems on the network which have modems attached.

I would be more than interested in looking at, or evaluating, any
new software which might fit the bill.

Peter.

You must change both the UART (8250) and the 2 support chips, unless the
support chips are newer than the UART.  Wherever you buy a 16550 you usually
get the two little support chips too (1489 and 1488).  The 3 chips are pin
compatible with your old setup.  Just drop them in and all should be well.  It
worked for me.

hfs tells me:

Any clue?

The floppy drive blinks for a short time, so I am sure, that hfs finds
the device and of course I have inserted a Macintosh HD floppy.

some recent boards appear to have problems with

change modes.  When it works, it's nice not
to worry about what dot-clocks you have available,
since the card can synthesize any with about
0.1 MHz resolution.

I haven't heard any horror stories, and some
people have reported success.

Prices should range from US$99 (Taiwan mail order)
to US$160 (STB local retail)  All these cards should come
with 1M 60ns DRAM, and be useful up to about 70 MHz dot-clock,
sufficient to run 1024x768ni.  Going above 1024x768 is not
normally recommended, both because you run out of DRAM bandwidth,
and you start eating into the 256K used for font caching.
STB says their parts should "work" up to 80 MHz dot clock, and
the freq synthesizer and RAMDAC is limited by XFree to 110 MHz.

There is also Flagship for porting clipper stuff and Flagship for Linux is
already out.  In addition codebase portability edition works fine with Linux
and gives you C libs and C++ class libs for Dbase/clipper/fox file formats
including fast indexing and network locking.

I have a completely unbraned S3 card from Taiwan. (Its simply called S3
VGA - I don't know the manufacturer, but if anyone's interested I could
open up my PC and have a look at it ...) It has 1MB RAM on board. I originally
tried using icd2061a in my Xconfig, but nothing much worked. I replaced
that with a clocks line, guessed from reading the card documentation. I
get 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768 (256 colour) all at 70ish Hz. I can
also get 1150x900 (I think) at 50Hz (yuk!). Switching modes is more or less
instant, but the monitor takes 1s or so to sync to each mode.

Its only a cheap card - 85 pounds here in the UK. (Its VL bus BTW)
