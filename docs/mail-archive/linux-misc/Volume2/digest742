I have a HP deskjet that exhibited the same behavior. Read the Printer-HOWTO
and found a filter in the HOWTO that fixed the problem. The HOWTO is sketchy
in many places, but one thing that's done well is explaining what the 
permissions need to be on all files involved with lpd and lpr. Give it a
read. One question I do have... The HOWTO mentioned that it is possible to 
use ghostscript as a filter to print .ps documents but they didn't provide
enought of a clue for a low power techie like myself. Anyone have some
more specific instructions to accomplish this?

Does anyone else have the problem that the status window with the

filled with the dungeon view and have no idea how much health is left.

: same here.

Use twm while you play doom.  The key-bindings don't conflict with the
game like fvwm, or you can edit your .fvwmrc file to fix the problem.

Otherwise your alt key will act like a toggle key and the ctrl-arrow
will change the virtual screen.  Not good...

I find this layout to give me very good play control...comprable to
using the mouse.  When I play doom for dos i use the mouse to turn
left and right, and the arrows for moving forward and backword and a
similar layout for strafeing and such.  Anyone who uses the mouse to
move forward and backward should be shot.  bad bad bad...  :-)

Hope this helps...

I really hope that you are kidding.  I'd hate to think that our fine 
educational system is producing people so stupid as to think that reducing the 
length of cable between an amplifier and the speakers would have an observable 
effect.  Think about it:  sound travels through the air about 730 miles per 
hour at sea-level, electronic signals travel through wire at close to the 
speed of light (roughly 186,000 miles per _second_).  If you were to make 
_any_ adjustments to the speaker placement, you'd be better off putting on 
headphones (though the difference would still be virtually unobservable).

The program "/usr/bin/dip -i" is not there.... "/usr/bin/dip" is.
You have to create a script, diplogin, something like:

and use _that_ as your shell.

   I hope David Taylor will have a little bit of time to fix the byte
   ordering problems in pixel scaling.....  :-)  I don't know what their
   deal is with not making money off Linux.  I'd never buy a DOS game
   because I go to DOS so little, but I would be very tempted to buy
   registered Doom or Doom II for Linux.  

This may be the first public announcement of this, but while I
was poking around sunsite tonight I noticed the dates on
linxdoom.tgz and linxdoom.lsm were tonight (actually, they looked
like they were from the future, time zone differences included).
The new linxdoom.lsm (the original of which everyone ought to
read; maybe I'll post it) is just a note from ddt saying that the
pixel-doubling and -tripling code has been fixed; I snarfed the
new linxdoom.tgz and yes, it has been, although the quadruple
mode is still a bit off.  You'd better have a really good video
card if you want to run Doom that way, though; while I get great
performance at normal scale, -2 is pretty much unplayable and -3
is purely of academic interest (of course, I have an ISA video
card so my raw video copy performance is poor).

Now I'm just hoping ddt will have the time and inclination to
make it possible to run sound PWADs with Linux Doom; I found that
my favorite sound PWAD (jbrown.wad) works in DOS but not in
Linux.  Level PWADs seem to work fine.

When I sent a thank-you note to ddt for Linux Doom, I asked if it
would confuse the sales people if I called and asked for a
registered copy of Linux Doom.  He said yes, it would confuse
them and wondered why I'd want to buy a second registered copy.
When ddt announced that he was working on a Linux port, I
promised myself that I'd buy another copy of Doom if ddt pulled
off the Linux port.  I used to work for a game software company,
and we never would have been allowed to write a game as cool as
Doom or port it to Linux.  I'll buy another registered copy of
Doom just to reward id for letting this happen.

        I really hope that you are kidding. I'd hate to think that our
fine educational system is producing people so stupid that they can't
recognize HUMOR.  I thought that the "Get shorter cables" comment was
actually amusing.

        In any case, I'd have to check my physics book for exact
numbers, but I've got a grasp on the general theory.  First, it
doesn't really matter how fast the electrons are moving "along the
cable."  What matters is the speed of the electic field.  It does move
pretty darn close to C.  Second, while the electrons are jittering
back and forth and bumping into one another, they do make progress in
the direction of the electric field.  The rate, electron drift speed?,
is much slower than C - in fact muhc slower than .1 C.

Gee, I hope I'm right.

  I read a statement in a mail-related newsgroup to the effect that it was
possible to send a certain signal that would tell me if I was talking to
(in some sense) a standard daemon on the other end of my PPP hookup. 

  I am not sure the speaker was speaking in general but the example given was

        telnet <domain> 143

  Is some such thing possible?

   I went out and bought a Soundblaster 16 and a mini-stereo as
accessories for DOOM for Linux.  Yeah, I'd pay for a proper Linux 
commercial version of DOOM.
