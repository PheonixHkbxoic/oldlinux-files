I'd like to obtain a word processor for linux, of the MS Word or IslandWrite
variety:  WYSIWIG, menu-driven, et. al.  Does any of you know of such a beast?
Please email me in addition to posting, particularly if you have one installed
(vendor email invited as well).

If linux had 1) a good word processor, 2) Quicken, and 3) ran my dos/windows
multi-media toys, I'd wipe dos/windows off my disk completely.  Assistance
appreciated!

since my slip server itself uses a Cisco for it's default route, I also had

Well the problem is what constitutes an interface and thats something GNU
do need to clean up. There are numerous other little problems with it like
any other license

eg      -       Can BSD code be incorporated and redistributed as part
                of a GPL program: Specifically does the BSD license
                requirement for credits in the documentation etc count
                as an 'additional restriction' on distribution as the GPL
                requires there are none. If it does (as my legal info says)
                then you can't mix BSD with GPL and distribute the result.
                If it doesn't can I therefore sell software GPL'd but with
                a documentation requirement of must come with this expensive
                booklet I've written ?

        -       How do inline functions in include files related to the GPL

        -       What about structures from include files

        -       When is a dynamic link a dynamic link 

        -       Interface issues. If I build a system that can use an LGPL
                shared library I don't have to give a damn about the LGPL -
                It hasn't got any gnu code in it and if people choose to
                plug the two together its up to them.

A GPL v3 seems needed for at least one of these issues.

This only applies if the original sale did not already include a copy
of the source code.  The intent here is that there should be no
opportunity for a company to sell a program object code (such as a
binary) for a low price and then the source code for a high price so
that the profit once again derives from the "restricted" access to the
source code.  If, however, the program is delivered in one package
which includes the source code, then it may be sold at any price.

The idea is simple.  You can sell GPLed code, you just can't sell it
without also providing ready access to its source code.  If you want
to distribute without the hassle of delivering megs of C files to
users who usually won't care, then there is a provision (quoted above)
to make life easy for you.

I just called O'Reilly & Associates today.  The Linux Network
Administrator's Guide will be delayed until December, but they are
taking back orders now.  The operator I talked to heard that there
are plans for another book.

Also highly recommended is: TCP/IP Network Administration.  It has
general info on the protocols, routing, name service, sendmail, and a
little security.  Also has a good section on troubleshooting.

This is what comp.os.linux.announce is for. It has been around for

 ^^^^^^^

Actually, this is not true.  We purchased the ``Accelerated'' X server
from X-Inside a few weeks ago.  We also purchased an ATI MACH 64
specifically because of this and other advertisements which make such
claims.  After working through versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the server
without success, I called them back to get some technical assistance.
They finally told me that a later release would fix the problem (It's
not that the performance was poor -- the server never worked at all.)
They promised to FedEx a working version to me ASAP.  It never
arrived.  I called back.  It was to arrive yesterday.  Still nothing.

Jeremy Chatfield has not returned a single phone call.  Gary Anderson
was great at selling me on X-Inside but has failed to produce a
working product or deliver any of his promises.  I am actively
seeking a refund.

Let the buyer beware.

Yup, I'm doing this. I get 40.something BogoMips on it. I'm using an AMD 
486DX2-66 with an SiS 486-471 VL bus motherboard.

One catch. It crashes randomly unless I have the case cover off and a 
desk fan blowing on the motherboard. And yes, I do have a fan on the case 
(*and* a CPU fan), but it wasn't enough.

I'd still recommend it, though. There's a hole on the case to mount a 
second fan, and I think once I do that the problems will clear up -- the  
one that came with the case is pretty weak.
