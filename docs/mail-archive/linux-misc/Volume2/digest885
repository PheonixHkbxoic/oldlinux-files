On high end machines, the performance of Linux-DOOM really isn't that bad.

In 640x480 on a 100 Mhz Pentium,  DOOM scores 34.9 frames per second...and
it has maximum 35 fps!

        For the last time: Linus pronounces Linux as 'Lee-nooks', but he 
suggests that it be pronounced in other languages in the way that sounds 
the most natural. "Lih-nus" is the closes English equivalent. If you want 
to pronounce it as Linus does (Lee-nooks) go ahead, but you will sound 
really weird.

You will have to grab the latest version of the Linux kernel from a
suitable FTP site first.  Then,

cd /usr/src
umask 022
rm -rf linux
tar xvvfz linux-1.1.xx.tar.gz
cd linux
make config                     <- Select suitable options

Subject: malloc() error, won't use swap space.
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 16:03:20 GMT

I've been developing a MUD for about a year now, and while it runs on an SGI,
I (of course) prefer to do my development at home on my Linux box mainly 
because its more convienient and much faster.  I do my work at home and upload
the changes to the SGI.  Every 2 or 3 weeks I download a new set of source from
the SGI to my linux box as there are 3 other coders working on the project as
well.  Its always ran great under Linux up until my last source update, and
now I'm getting a funny error, which I'll just quote right off:

malloc failure: Out of memory
IOT trap

The application takes about 14 megs to run once the databases are all loaded.
Watching from another VT with top I notice that the app is dying right at the
point where physical ram is depleted.  It is not dipping into swap space at
all.  (I've got 16 megs physical and 16 swap)  Neither is it using any of the
ram set aside for 'buffer' which is usualy quite a bit.  In fact I've got
enough physical ram to run the app if it would use it.  The odd thing to me
is that This program has always run up until that last update, however I've
been unable to find anything different in the code to do with memory
allocation.  And we use RCS so it would have been easy to find.

I'm runnin Kernel 1.1.38 and gcc 2.5.8.

Any ideas what would keep malloc() from using swap space or even stealing
some space away from the buffer area?

Thanks for any input!

Once again , contrary to popular belief, there are ways to make these Diamond

Lots of other people will probably say this as well, but Perl does
have arrays.  And quite a lot more--it is a much better language for
writing scripts in than any of the shells I have tried.  It is faster
as well.

I think splitting the script language off from the command interpreter
is a good idea.  Shells need to be quick and easy to use
interactively, whereas script languages need to be efficient and well
structured.

Hello,

I have heard that for EISA SCSI on linux, the BusLogic 747S is a safe

card out called the BusLogic 757S!  Is the 757S fully compatible with the

Hmpf - it would seem all the bootimages I can find do NOT support

this - does anyone have a boot image of that kernel? 

I am trying to do an initial install on my 540 meg disk with

  How come interramp.com gives me its IP address but snarf.com won't?

  Or, what do I have to do (differently) to make snarf.com give me its
IP address?

  interramp.com assigns me a "random" (dynamic) IP address each time I
dial up, but snarf.com (supposedly) assigns me a fixed IP address.

  Is snarf.com maybe saying "I'll tell you my IP address if you tell
me your IP address"?

This is a fun thread.  I'm accustomed to nroff/troff/groff, having

I am looking for a card that can support this.

Ok...LaTeX has all this stuff....however, is it at least WYSIWYG?  ie:

I get it for Linux?

Agreed, but those improvements yield a 2x to 3x speed increase at the same
clock speed for a 486 vs. 386.  Esp the onboard FPU (5x the speed of an
external 387 class chip) and single-clock cycle instruction execution.  And
the improvements in chip fabrication (.5 micron and smaller traces) allow the
chip to run at higher clock rates and pack more on-chip features with their
lower latency into the package.

Why is it that every publisher/author seems to need to claim that their 
book is 'the definitive reference' to thus-and-such.

Using my basic etemological skills, it seems that definitive would mean 
'defining'.  I think its a little presumptous of this publisher to claim 
that their book (and only their book, as indicated by the definate 
artical 'the') defines what Linux is or isn't.

This is not a big point, or perhapse even very imporant, but its a little
