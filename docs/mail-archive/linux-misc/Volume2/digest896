The discussion is on sunsite.unc.edu if you can ever get it to work. It is
quite amusing. Linux has modules but they are not the same thing as a
message passing kernel - nothing like it.

Marvin Wu is a competent and conscientious Linux workstation vendor.  
He certainly believed your machine was in good working order
when he sent it to you and it has not failed since you sent it back.

Like a new car, you may have trouble with a new computer.  The problem is
that you can't just take it back to the dealer and tell him to fix it
if you bought it mail order.  You agreed to pay shipping back and forth
for warranty service and you agreed to ship your machine back to SWT
within 30 days for a full refund if you were not satisfied.  Marvin Wu
extended this money back guaranty to 60 days then 90 days at your request.

Since you have made no attempt to acquire another Linux workstation,
it is not clear that any PC-clone vendor would be able to provide you
with satisfactory service.  It might even appear that you decided that
you didn't really need or couldn't afford a new workstation sometime
after you made your deal with SWT and that you just strung Marvin Wu
along for three months then tried to beat him out of the shipping costs
as well.

It appears to me that Marvin Wu made an honest effort to live up to his part
of the agreement and was overly generous when he agreed to pay half of the
shipping costs to return the workstation.  I think that you should accept
the fact that you were bound to live up to your half of the agreement.

Well, Emacs never pretended to be a word processor, at least until now.
And I feel, it shouldn't except simple little things like different
fonts (see Xemacs, former Lucid Emacs).

Well, I don't know about editors but many scientific journals except
a LaTeX file. They don't do anything with it -- just print. Besides,
many journals move to the electronic way of publishing, so YOU print
a document.

Date: 6 Oct 1994 05:34:15 GMT

I'm a COMPUTER USER from HK. Generally I hate all those retailer who 
cheat their customers for profit, selling buggy components...etc. 
However, after following the recent thread of Jonathan's *LONG* complaint 
about SW Technologies, strangely :-) I don't have much sympathy on the 
customer. Rather, I'm not sure who's the victims... :-|. 

Something from Jonathan saying that "...I'll keep reposting the message 
until they admit their fault or out of business..." make me feel awkward. 
I don't there is such big deal to justify forcing someone until they die 
.. One thing that SW Technologies did wrong is they didn't have enought 
money in bank, causing a bounced-cheque charge ($4) for Jonathan. I think 
it's fair if SW Technologies pay him $4 and let the case settle...


Personally, I think the requirements from Jonathan is just too much. 
Everyone in the Linux world know that Linux is provided "AS IS", you try 
it at your own risk. There are numerous reports people trashing their 
filesystem when using a new Kernel...etc.... I don't quite buy what 
Jonathan says "... not counting the time that I spent on this 
machine...". If Jonathan kept the PENTIUM machine for the 3 months, and 
finally the deal was off, I think it's fair for him to at least pay for 
half of the shipping. Moreover, even from Jonathan's statement, I can see 
that Marvin has been trying hard to help by shipping replacements and 
suggesting importments... Nothing in the world is perfect...

A final word, Jonathan, PLEASE DON"T periodically reposting your LONG 
statement ( and the finely tunned correction/amandment... are we in the 
California court?). Just try to think there are how many news server 
around the world and your REPEATED posting may consume a few GB of disk 
space :-)....


Just my personal opinion.

Subject: PPP disconnect question
Date: 7 Oct 1994 14:15:29 GMT

Hi,

I made a script to automatically dial in onto our PSTN gateway, which,
after giving some user info, calls me back again.

For this I use pppd from the 2.1.2a distribution.
I do this by calling pppd and specifying the connect and disconnect options.
The connect option works great, my script with chat script is called,
dialing occurs and information is fed to the PSTN gateway.

Later, when I want to disconnect, I run a script called ppp-kill.
It finds the pppd pid and sends it a SIGHUP. Now, I expected the
disconnect script to be run next by pppd but it isn't.

Couple observations: the man page discussed this option, the binary
'reveals' the disconnect support (strings -a pppd), but the source
doesn't contain it! The pppd program doesn't complain about the
option either.

What gives? Anyone who knows the details?

Well, the default is write is 1.  When I try 2, lilo bombs with a crc error

Hey you should get a Xircom Ethernet PCMCIA, (get a modem on it too)
I used it for: <running at once, mind you>

        exceed/W
        Novell Netware
        SNMP agent
        Chameleon NFS
        
Works great, and in exceed/W, you can open about 6 xterms or other TCP/IP
connects before the adapter says it's stuffed.
It cost me about 200bux w/o modem.

if you want to do WORD processing and not TEXT editing, and you don't want to use something
like latex or troff--personally, i don't like them--you might try using a combination of
DOSEMU and WordPerfect for DOS.  i've gotten WPDos6.0 running in graphics mode.  i haven't
given it a good workout yet to test its stability, but it looks nice.  and DOSEMU just keeps
getting better.

if you've already got WP its worth a try.  WP5.1 might be more stable, but it's without the
added graphics editing mode which i really like.

hope that helps,

I also agree.  Many people will give you the "if you can't take the heat of 
setting X up, get out of the kitchen", but I think it's time that we got past 
that attitude...after all, they don't have to use it.

To put it simple...X at it's defaults is UGLY!   Even when you add fvwm to it, 
it's still kinda ugly...it's just to damn bland.

>1) A mouse-driven tool for setting common X resource preferences would

Isn't there an app that comes with X that does this? I remember one that shows 
a tree of resources that you can set right on that screen.   Of course, the 
thing to do then would be to grab the resource database and save it into 
.Xdefaults for the user.

Oh...I see...More than just the resources.   Some stuff, like speakers, etc... 
isn't X, but the hardware.  Still, at worst, you could have some app bar like 
you mentioned where you click on the speaker and it calls up a mixer program 
for the sound card.

As you mentioned, too much is command line based.  Perhaps a Tcl/Tk or other 
program that would give a decent interface and call the command line funtions 
behind your back.  (and in the tradition of HP-UX's Sam, even create a log 
file of what it executed for later reference.)

I don't know about that...but this goes back to the program that I mentioned 
earlier.  It changes things on the fly.  I wish I could remember the name.  
It's one of the standard X apps.  I don't think anything has to be specially 
compiled, but I've been wrong before :)

>Maybe a drop-in replacement for some of the X shared libraries could

Since you mentioned drop-in replacements:  One suggestion would be to 
automatically include Xaw3d instead of plain old Xaw.

You can ftp mfm (Motif File Manager) with static linked libraries...kinda slow

Perhaps you should look at the GREAT package.  It is very similar to VUE.  (On 
my system, it even runs as slow as VUE :)


Also:
        nice fonts - the default fixed font at 1024x768 is very hard to see.
        fvwm menus that are useful.  The most recent slackware ones are
                real good.  Earlier dists. didn't have much to them.

I just got XFree86-3.1 and installed it on my machine.  I have a Cirrus-6440
chipset.  I am trying to run the XF86-SVGA server.  I managed to make the 
server happy by telling it I had a Cirrus-6420 chipset (like the docs say to
do).  When the server comes up, I get a nice, crisp, clear display on my 
LCD notebook, except for the fact that the top 50 pixels or so and the
bottom 50 pixels of the screen are screwed up.  The bottom 50 pixels of the 
display are identical to the top 50 pixels on the display...only shifted by
about 100 pixels.

My question is this:  I have a dual-scan color LCD display and a cirrus 6440
chipset.  Does it make sense for me to determine the video modes for my 
display as discussed in the text file VideoModes.txt?  How do I treat an LCD
display when trying to determine video modes and sync frequencies?  Does my 
problem sound like a video timings problem or does it sound like a problem in
which my server is mis-using VRAM?

Specifically, here is my system:
        1.  Sager NP7500 Notebook/dual scan color LCD (640x480x256)
        2.  1MB VRAM.
