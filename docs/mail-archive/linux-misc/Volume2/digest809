From what I've read on the net, Linux uses bounce buffers, DMAing into

It's possible, but you must use the nonrewinding device /dev/nrmt0 and find
the right place on the tape 'by hand' (using 'mt fsf <n>'). I never tried

Hello,

I have installed a licenced version of WordPerfect 5.1 for SCO-Unix.

After starting it i get the following error message:
> xwp

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for  
operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  0
  Resource id in failed request:  0x4
  Serial number of failed request:  39
  Current serial number in output stream:  40

If i run it after the DEMO version of WordPerfect it works fine.

Any comments?

True... but I think he was talking about the destination address, not the
interface address... you can route either the loopback _net_, or the
loopback _host_, with equal facility.

Why can't the Mitsumi read digital data from audio CDs?  Is this a

To add the final nail to the coffin:
Since the cacheing works from 0000 up, and DOS conventional memory
is all in the lowest area, you don't ordinarily see the slowdown.
It's only when you're USING that higher memory that the lack of cacheing
gets you... like a UNIX-type OS does.  If you use that new-and-uncached 
memory in Windows you'll see it slow down too, when your system resources 
start getting used up that high.  (But even uncached it still looks faster 
than it used to with 8M because you are using real memory 
for the 8-16M area instead of disk swap space.  Changing the cacheing
appropriately results in a _further_ speedup over just installing the
extra memory.)

The point being, DOS and Windows don't use that memory often or well --
which is why they don't get the same benefit from it that Linux does.

Subject: Errors writing to MSDOS Partition
Date: 20 Sep 94 07:43:37 GMT

Hello,

I'm running Linux on a 386-33Mhz with 8 MB memory. I've an Adaptec
1542 SCSI Board and a 80MB Disk from SeaGate and a 660MB Disk from HP.
Linux works fine with the ext2 filesystem. Only writing on a msdos
partition almost ever leads to corrupt files. This happens only if
I write a file on my msdos Partion on the harddisk. Floppies do fine.

I found out that files get corrupted doing a "sync" or waiting until
the buffer has been copied to disk.

For example:

        cp file /msdos/file
        diff file /msdos/file

        no differences will be found until the buffer has been flushed 
        to disk.

Doing:  cp file /msdos/file
        sync
        diff file /msdos/file

        will show up differences in over 90% of the tries!!!!

My dos partition uses to second half of the HP disk (the upper cylinders).
I think the disk has about 1400 Cylinders, put I actualy don't know.
The partition was created using fdisk from linux and FAT 16 BIT as 
filesystem.

I hope someone can help me to fix this problem!!!

The reason people buy Indigos (and SGIs in general) is not to have
general CPU compute servers.  The reason, quite simply, is graphics.
(Yup, that's what the 'G' in SGI stands for).  The amount of graphics
rendering hardware one can get in an SGI is more than just about any
other off-the-shelf workstation, certainly more than in a PC.
Combine this with their GL 3-d graphics libraries, and you've got a
system for doing really really nice graphics programming.

Hmmm....remind me when I get home to check and see what this Andrew Word

Yes, MS-Word doesn't run under Linux (yet), but there is more to life than

This I am not sure about...but isn't there IPX support in the kernel?  Or is 
it still rough?  Plus, I think you can connect to a Netware server under 
DOSEMU.

It's not my fault if you bought proprietary and bad hardware from IBM.  
Gee...I doubt there is a ReelMagic MCA card either...guess that means it sucks 
too.

There is also no support for light pens.   Hey...if you want the support, 
write it or help contribute...but obviously Token Ring hasn't been in much 
demand.  I guess this goes back to that buying IBM stuff again :)

Yeah...so.  They're scheduled aren't they.  If you want them right away, call

Bull shit.  That is a laugh.

Really...gee...video capture, cd-rom access (as that's what DOS dweebs usually

>11. Support for ISDN is not generally available.

Don't know...don't care.

>12. There is no disk-compression.

So...call Stacker.  Or go back to DOS, or buy a new hard drive.  Actually, 
there is code (on sunsite) for either a compressed filesystem, or one that 
runs almost everything through a built-in-gzip.  It may not be called 
DoubleSpace, but it does exist.

Okay...for the record:  Linux is not DOS.  If you want to do the same things 
you do under DOS, then friggin run DOS or Windows.   I'm sorry that it doesn't
