I am trying to get Mosaic on my linux box here, but it requires Motif - 
and i only have an emulator for it, not the libraries!! Does anyone know 
of a COMPILED binary version of the latest version (2.4 or so) with all 
the other required files ???

i got version 1.2 off of tsx-11.mit.edu, but it says it can't find the 
'Connect' program...

I really would like the latest version, though !!!!

Please email any replies, thank you!!

--text follows this line--
      
I have a few *BRAND NEW* Texel SCSI CD-ROM drives. These drives went for $199 regularly.  I will give them to anyone who wants one for $135 each.  Call
me ASAP if you want one.  You can call *ANYTIME* 7 days a week up until
2:00 AM.  I will give them out on a first come first serve basis and they will go FAST.  Just think, now you can impress all your friends with the cool way that your computer can play music CD's and do multi-media stuff.  (Also, if you need a SCSI controller I have a new Adaptec 1540B for $90.00.)

These are Texel DM3021 SCSI CD-ROM drives.  They are internal 5 1/4" Half Height Drives.  They will work with *ANY* SCSI controller.  The drivers (i.e., ASPI managers) come with your SCSI controller.  They are brand new, still in the box, and come with Documentation, 50 pin SCSI ribbon cable, and mounting rails.  They have a headphone jack on the front so that you can play Audio CD's on your computer.  Also, I will E-mail a FREE CDplayer to anyone who wants one.  (The CD-Player puts an audio CD-Player panel on your screen and plays audio CD's through the headphone jack or through speakers.)  They also have an audio output jack on the back so that you can play Audio CD-ROMS and multi-media apps through your soundboard.  I presently have a drive installed and I can do all of the multi-media stuff on mine.  The drives are 100% guaranteed for 30 days.  If you get one and you don't like the way it matches your wallpaper simply return it for your money back *NO QUESTIONS ASKED*!

These drives also work perfectly with Linux, BSD, and other Unices for the PC. They work fine with Macs.  The dimensions of the drive are as follows: 5 1/4" x 1 1/2" x 8 1/2" (Standard 5 1/4" half height internal PC drive dimensions).

I can take Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express for these.  You can call *ANYTIME* up until 2:00 AM to order one.  My home phone number is (414) 629-1804. If you think it is too late and they are already gone call anyway because your call will put you in line for one if I can get any more.  If nobody is home you can leave a message on our machine and I will call you within hours of your leaving a message.

The cost is as follows:

 Texel SCSI CD-ROM Drive                  $135.00
 S&H                                                      $ 10.00
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TOTAL                                                 $145.00

 (This is the amount that would be charged to your credit card.)

 If you are going to pay with a check or money order:

 In order to acquire a Texel make your payment or money order for $135.00
 + $10.00 S&H payable to:

 Dr. John V. Jaskolski

 send it to:

 Dr. John V. Jaskolski
 6120 Hillcrest Drive

 E-MAIL me confirming exactly what you want and in what quantity and
 indicate how much money you sent in your payment.

Does Linux save the msgs it spews out at boot time, to a file ? These msgs
whiz by so fast, it's practically impossible to note everything that's
happening. Any info would be appreciated.

If anyones interested, ive got the latest version of the authors bbs,
with a few mods for linux + a few local changes I've made.
 
Include... Internode chat from within the bbs.  Type / at the main menu.
           Broadcasts to all nodes "User xxx has logged in/out".
           
Still need to be written.  A replacement for CitadelRmail.  It doesnt
seem to come with it, one of these days...  And a easy way for it to
read the usenet message database.

You can start by looking at my g3vga viewver for the linux console and
take out the relevant raster image routines and building a X11 bitmap straight
off. The decoding routines are extremely fast.

Alternatively if you are concerned by speed, it is an overkill starting X11
just to view/page turn fax documents. The g3vga viewver will let you do this
on the plain linux console.


If you are interested, you may find it at

        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/g3vga-0.5b.tar.gz

and other good archives.

Following responses to my posting about Linux and dpt controllers, I got the
kernel image vmlinuz.eata.gz from tsx-11, from the directory :
/pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi

It seemed to recognise the disk and tape. But then, it crashed. The boot
messages were as follows :

        .
        .
        .
scsi : detected 1 SCSI tape 1 SCSI disk total
        .

Partition check :

ll-rw-block : only 1023968 - char blocks implemented (1024)

MINIX-fs : unable to read superblock
SCSI disk request error : invalid device
Kernel panic : No device passed to allocate_device()


I would really appreciate any help. Thanks.

Subject: NETATALK for Linux?
Date: Fri, 2 Sep 1994 19:23:53 GMT

Has anyone ported or worked on porting the netatalk package to Linux?
(It's an Appletalk for Unix package)
This looks to me to be a better alternative to CAP for those of us
without an Appletalk router.  Netatalk is able to talk Phase 2
Ethertalk directly and is supposed to be faster than CAP because it is
tightly tied to the kernel (here's the part that might make porting
fun).  Currently netatalk runs on SunOS and Ultrix.

I faced the same dilema 3 months ago and I choose the DX4 solution. I
considered the following:

- The high heat output of the P5. I built my own system so I didn't
  need to worry whether the case I'm using is suitable, ..etc.
- 3.3 v technology is more reliable.
- The P5 60/66 5v technology is a deadend. You can't upgrade to anything.
- The difference in total system performance is not that significant.
[It takes 9 minutes to compile a fully featured kernel on my system.
Anyone with a P5 cares to compare?]
- At the time I saw too many complaints about P5 motherboards and 
  chipsets.

No, Mubashir is right. You can use a magic filter which detects what kind of
file you're trying to print and acts accordingly. It says this and gives a 
couple of examples in the Printing HOWTO, but I couldn't get them to work with
my HP DeskJet 520 either, so I too have two different printer names at the 
moment. If anyone can solve this little problem i'd appreciate it.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.
