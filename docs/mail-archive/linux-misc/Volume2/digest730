I just downloaded a copy from sunsite.unc.edu.  I've noticed two major
problems:
  1. Things are mirror immaged at block level.  This makes most of the
     screen very difficult to view.  As an example letter A in ammow
     appears as
        _
       / \ 
       ___||
          ||
          ||
           ^--> i.e. half the leg of A is on the wrong side.

This problem is only present if I use the -2, -3, or -4 option.


  2. There is significant delay between action and sound.  i.e. I
     can fire my gun and then turn halfway around before the gun
     sound comes through my speakers.


Also I can't figure out how to use the VGA mode instead, of the x
mode.


    Hans> Followup-To: alt.games.doom

Sorry, that is not one of the alt newsgroups carried by my site.   In
general it is not a good idea to use a Followup-To: line from an

the sounds are the same (with the 16bit..).. and in 640x480 the size
is very playable.. nice to be able to get in a quick doom session
without having to take the linux box off the net for it's ususal inet

Subject: >>Cheap Ethernet Pocket adapter and driver source!<<
Date: 9 Sep 1994 16:14:13 GMT

I have recently purchased a "generic" pocket ethernet adapter
for my notebook.  It turns out to be an Accton EtherPocket-SP.
It costs less than $100, the barrier I was waiting to see
brocken.  It works well from DOS on the parallel port of my
notebook talking to my Linux machine.

What would be very nice, is the ability to boot Linux on the
notebook and use the pocket ethernet adapter from Linux.
The nice people at Accton in Taiwan have sent me the complete
assembly source of their packet driver for DOS.

I don't know how compatible this is with other pocket adapters,
but the information should all be there in the source.
Porting the driver is too much for me for now.

Anyone interested in getting a Linux driver to work for this?
Seems like many people would like notebook connectivity for
Linux for less than $100.   Thanks, dennis@math.nwu.edu

Dumb DigiBoard cards are supported by the kernel, turn on BOCA support in
drivers/char/serial.c and set the card to addresses 100h, 108h etc.

Intelligent cards are being worked on as far as I know. I've no idea when
(and if) a driver will be available.

Anyone patched the dumd driver to use the card's status register? Would

There is no need for a Linux port of WordPerfect for Unix.  WordPerfect
for Unix already runs under Linux using ICBS/COFF.  Better to pester
WordPerfect for aknowledgement and support of using the SCO version on
Linux.

Again, there is no need for a Linux version of WP.  The SCO version runs
fine.... pester them for official support of running the SCO version
under Linux IBCS/COFF (which is a possibility); don't bother worrying
about a native Linux version because it WILL NOT HAPPEN.

Date: 9 Sep 94 19:31:42 GMT

My software runs better on Linux than on OS/2.

Details:

I installed all the gnu-stuff on OS/2.  The code I ran had a core
image of 4MBytes on SPARCs.  On OS/2 it was 10MBytes (I'm not sure
why I think it my be a lot of those gcc-lib/emx DLL's or something).
That plus 8MBytes for the OS/2 system core and my computer was
swapping like mad (I have only 16MBytes of RAM).  (I'd appreciate
it if an OS/2 expert can tell me if I'm doing something wrong).

OS/2 is horrible when it starts swapping.

I decided I could not do my work in OS/2 and installed Linux.  The
same program which required 4Mbytes on SPARC also took 4M on Linux,
and the kernel overhead, after recompiling, was only approx 250k.
On top of that, I did not have to convert my csh shell scripts to
REXX.   So now I'm more or less happy with Linux except I'm still
complaining because Linux will not let me run matlab for windows,
nor can I run Quicken while waiting for a process to complete
in the background.

Nothing is perfect I guess!  But if I wanted to do my work on OS/2
I would have to go out and buy a lot more memory.

 Like you all know, DOOM linux is out.

 But what about a DOOM linux version that run with TERM ? It would be less
painfull that blocking your computer using the modem version. I don't know 
if it wouldn't be simpler to have a IHHD server supporting term instead.

Opened discussion....

 Also, is there any server on the internet that provide IHHD doom. I am probably
not the only one who don't know anybody to play with (even with the net version)
and would like to meet people from all over the world on the DOOM playground.

Over lunch today, I mentioned this thread to the guy who is in charge of
software piracy issues for Novell-Wordperfect in Europe.  His reaction was
"forward the thread to me".  (See above, re legal insurance.)

BTW, I understand that WP 6 for UnixWare is in beta.

And so far, distribution, configuration and consulting businesses

these are groups where these limits are actually respected, as opposed

Yea, Yea!  Thats the ticket.  What a great suggestion.  Not!  :-) :-)
Last I check signals travel fairly fast through speaker wire.  I
suppose someone could get long enough cables for this to be a problem, but
at that point I would be more worried about my floor caving in from
tons of cable.  Someone else pointed out the problem is that the sound
is playing at way too slow of a speed.  That is probably why the sound
continues even after I quit the game.

It sounds like, from other people's post, sound isn't working properly
for anyone.  If I turn off the speakers and drop the screen resolution
it is playable, but not with anywhere near the quality I can get in
DOS...  From dos it takes the full screen and the sound works 
right.  I guess I won't be ordering any of the other episodes if
this is the best it gets.  However, I'm still hoping there is a 
way to change the audio device defaults to get it to work right.
