You're simplifying things too much.  The original unix didn't do
a whole lot.  And it also relied upon swapping, so that 64K wasn't
as restrictive as it might seem (it swapped whole processes though,
instead of paging).  The PDP had nicer machines to work with,
especially memory-management-wise, than most OS9 machines.

The IRQ3 is not a valid choise with the original SB. In addition it
conflicts with the serial port. It's possible to configure the SB driver
to use IRQ3 by modifying SBC_IRQ in linux/drivers/sound/local.h.

You can't use the same IRQ for two devices. In this case the PAS16 and the
SB emulation chip on it are separate devices. They can't share the same
IRQ. You could try to change the IRQ of PAS16. For example the IRQ10 is
a good alternative.

        I really hope that you are kidding! :-) We all know that sound
travels much slower than electrons in a wire don't we.. The obvious 
solution to the original problem is to maximise the distance the sound
has to travel as electrons and minimise the amount it has to travel as 
sound waves, so you should actually make the cables _LONGER_

Sheeesh, some people just can't see the obvious can they :-) ???

... and half the net is having the same trouble.

Here's the most important thing to remember:

*When using a multi-homed host as a router, EACH interface must have it's
own address.*

Routing on your local host tells IP where to send packets, based on their
destination address.  What you _tell_ the routing code is _which
interface_ to send the packets out on.  Therefore, each interface, (PPP is
an interface) must have a unique address.  Usually, you get the IP address
for your PPP interface from the provider's net, either statically, or
dynamically.  The "inside" address, the one you ifconfig onto your
ethernet interface, is part of your private net (either one you've
registered yourself, or part of a block assigned by your provider.)

A typical route information output in such a case might look like this...

Destination    Gateway          Netmask       Flags   MSS    iface
127.0.0.1      127.0.0.1        255.0.0.0     UH      1536   lo0
199.245.227.0  199.245.227.254  255.255.255.0 U       1436   eth0
default        198.147.221.1    255.255.255.0 U       1436   ppp0

(The person I'm helping with this right now, who owns those addresses,
will recognize them... :-)

This routes packets for the local host to the loopback interface, packets
for the local net (199.245.227) to the local interface which connects to
that net, and packets for every other network number to the PPP interface,
for forwarding to the outside world.

Everyone understand that?  :-)

Cheers,

Yes, we do need license agreements. International copyright (as per the
Berne Convention) says that stuff like books, articles, ...  is
copyrighted as soon as it is written, and at least over here in Germany
programs are mostly like literary works for the purposes of copyright.

So if you write a program, the copyright is yours. You may keep the
code, give it away or sell it, but the people who received the program
from you may not do *anything at all*, especially in the way of
redistributing it, without you *allowing* them to do so. That is
basically what a `license' is all about -- the word derives from the
Latin where `licet' means `it is allowed'. The fact that most commercial
license agreements are about forbidding redistribution is beside the
point; they go through intricate gyrations to make sure you're only
allowed to *use* the stuff but not to pass it on.

Subject: which is better: Mitsumi or Panasonic CDROM?
Date: 15 Sep 1994 21:58:39 GMT

I am thinking about getting a CDROM drive.  I am wondering which drive is
better (both are double speed): the Mitsumi with its own interface card or the
Panasonic with a SB16 card.  The Mitsumi is much cheaper (about half of the
cost of the Panasonic, though I haven't shopped around too much) but the
Panasonic comes with a pile of disks, I could upgrade to 16-bit sound, etc.  In
Cnd$ I can get the Mitsumi for $225 (with card) and the Panasonic/SB16
multimedia kit with disks for $399.

Any comments on which is better or worse with Linux and why?  I have seen a few
complaints about Mitsumi here about the IRQ for the card (which someone said
could easily be fixed by altering a header file).

  A set of VHDL models and tools for modeling the IEEE 1149.1
test standard is available as public domain from Northeastern
University. A paper describing the models and utilities was
presented at the VUIF spring conference.  A more detailed  
description of this work with the complete code for the models
and utility procedures was presented at the Atlantic Test Work-
shop in New Hampshire.  
  The software consists of a set of VHDL descriptions that model
the various components of the 1149.1 standard, and a set of  
procedures that can be used in a test bench for control and data
application to the standard models.  All models and utilities  
have been tested and readme and documentation files provide  
complete information for their usage.
  You will be able to ftp the software from the nuvlsi machine:
       nuvlsi.coe.northeastern.edu
  The ftp directory is:
       /pub/IEEE_1149/*
  Please use the models, and if you make improvements, please keep
us informed.  I appreciate if you send me a mail message if you get
the software.  This way I'll know who has the software.  My mail
address is navabi@northeastern.edu

The intent of all GPL developers is to encourage cooperation.
To further this goal, full source distribution is necessary.

Indeed! How absurd to think that people who devote hundreds or even
