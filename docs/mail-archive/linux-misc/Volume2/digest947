Wow, for that money you're in low-end RISC territory.  You can get entry
level RISC boxes from Sun, HP, or IBM for less than that, all with 16MB
RAM and at least 16" color monitors.  True, they have smaller disks (Sun
gives you a 535, IBM a 260, not sure about HP) and no tape, but you
get a _much_ faster CPU.  Of course, they don't include source to their
OSes either...

Someone is already doing it.  It's in the Linux Projects FAQ, and I
think it's called the Xu lib and Widget set or something similar.  In
the interim, how about somebody who has Motif for Linux making a static
binary of nedit like was done for Mosaic?  Any volunteers?

Hello!
As proud owner of Motif 1.2.4 I've tried to compile some of my favourite
applications. So, I have a problem running xephem 2.5:
If I select Solar System from the view menu I get the following error
message:

X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
resource denied)
  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
  Serial number of failed request:  1879
  Current serial number in output stream:  2095

and the program aborts.

I had no problems during the compilation. Other options work as expected,
e.g. the moon show. I'm using the standard X11 distribution
from Slackware 2.0.0.

I would appreciate every hint for a solution or what I am doing wrong.

Always willing to play Miss Thistlebottom, let me just remind you guys to
make sure those data structures can accommodate wide characters (e.g. what
you'd find in Unicide) and that your wrapping and other algorithms aren't
obsessive about text going left-right all the time!

  NEdit's home site is ftp.fnal.gov in /pub/nedit/v3_1

  in the contrib directory is a Makefile.linux, so it's already been 
done(pretty trivial).

  The catch is that it needs Motif, which isn't free. Anyone want to

You can't.  The reason for this is that the 320x200 mode in the SVGA server

1) uses a different chipset than anything else ("generic") to access 320x200

2) uses an entirely different X server (XF86_SVGA) than any accelerated servers
   (XF86_W32, XF86_Mach32, etc.)

Ctrl-Alt-+/- only scrolls thru different "modes" in the modes line of your
XF86Config; it can't scroll thru different chipsets/Xservers.

There -is- a way around this, tho; it involves cloning your startx and xinitrc
scripts and renaming them, then editing them to call the 320x200 server instead
of the usual accelerated server.  It works off of one XF86Config file, too.
So to run DOOM (what else would you be wanting to do in 320x200 mode? :) ) you
just run startx.doom, and that does appropriate stuff, and then calls xinit,
which calls xinitrc.doom (because you've told it to use xinitrc.doom rather
than xinitrc).  Heck, if yer really fancy, you can even have it start DOOM
centered in the right place and everything by editing the appropriate wm stuff
(but only if you're using two different wm's, one for 320x200 & one for sane
mode).  I run fvwm with DOOM and olvwm with my W32 server.  It's a nice setup,
once established.  Quite frankly, tho, it's a pain in the butt to get setup.
If anyone -really- wants the scripts, I could up them if you ask real nicely. 

:)

(warning, tho: the abovementioned scripts are -highly- specific to my machine,
and will most likely require minor (maybe major) tweaking to work)

That's a problem with xmodem (pads the file to a multiply of 128 bytes since 
it can only transfer 128-byte packets), NOT specific to Yggdrasil or Linux. 
Try it under DOS if you don't believe me.

It is not a $39.00 Unix. It is a $0.00 Unix; you paid $39.00 to the folks who 
put it on a CD-ROM for you. As for its quality, I would prefer Linux any time 
over some commercial Unixes (SCO or SunOS come to mind). Commercial folks have 
a hard time to beat a development team of hundreds, if not thousands, of 
enthusiastic people world-wide.

Just wanting to set the record straight; the problems you have are specific ot 
someone's compilation of Linux, not to Linux itself.

Conceptually it's a good idea but implementation of such an idea is tough.
See elm, tin, and the others use the editor as-is to do their work. To
create a Wordprocessor the key elements (especially the translation of
attributes to something visual like colors) must be integrated into the
editor. This means that we'd have to rewrite each editor that we wanted
to use in this system. The cost is clearly too great.

:That would allow a new user of this information processor to concentrate

Honestly any editor other than vi is a snap to use. You type, it shows up on
the screen. You use the arrows (yes I know vi, elvis, and vim can do this too)
and the cursor moves. Intuitive. Only the command keystrokes are different
and jed, emacs, and joe each provide mechanisms to map an arbitrary key to
an arbitrary command.

So in light of that I'm not inclined to think that this is a necessary
requirement. It'll be a lot easier and quicker to take one existing editor
(and I'm partial to JED and JOE in that order) and modifying it into a
wordprocessor.
