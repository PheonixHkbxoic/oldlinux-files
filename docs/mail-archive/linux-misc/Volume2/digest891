Subject: X vs non-X users?
Date: 6 Oct 1994 20:37:04 GMT

   The main reason I still have a DOS partition on my machine is that
I don't use X, and, as far as I know, there is no non-X previewer for
TeX that is equal in quality or ease of use to the emtex previewer
for DOS.

   This leads to a more general question.  I wonder whether we are
approaching the point where software for the two kinds of linux/unix
users will split the group.  I can't suggest any particular fix.
As a matter of curiosity, I wonder what the X/non-X ratio is.

1.1.52 has a small fix that sorts out MTU discovery when Linux is being
used as a router (normally this simply means problems with Solaris 2.3
hosts). There are a couple of small problems with  connections hanging
from the latest Cisco firmware and also from PC/TCP if your tcp window
parameter is set < your tcp mss parameter on PC/TCP. That as far as I can
tell is all thats seriously wrong with the current TCP code. Both the
CISCO and PC/TCP problem are the same and I'm currently working on sorting
those out.

There are other problems I get regular reports of like whole machines
suddenely locking absolutely solid with not even the keyboard or anything
else responding. This is always machines with an NE2000 clone and those
people with the hardware gadgets to check always find the card has jammed
the bus.

Only being a college student with limited funds, I am wandering...

Would it be better to get a 486dx-33 or 486sx-33 with 16megs of ram and a 
good video card, or should I get a 486dx2-66 with 8 megs and a crapola 
video card to run Linux on?

While I'm mentioning, is there any real advantage to getting a system 
from Dell, or Gateway or some there "Name Brand" as aposed to a system 
that will cost a LOT LESS from a no name copany like Cybermax, or 
Profesional Somthing or another?

And advice will help, Thanx.

You are the ASCII to TeX converter. Tex is just ASCII with formatting
statements embedded in the text. If you have an ASCII file all you need to
do is add a header and footer like:

\documentstyle{article}
\begin{document}

Your ASCII text goes here

\end{documet}

And that's the Latex file - well, almost. You still may need to add a few
backslashes: in front of every _ % $ or so (replace _ with \_ etc.) Then, if
you want to pretty up the text, you must add that information by hand.

Well, I am using jed (look at amy.harvard.edu).  That's a small programmable

I've been using Geomview as a 3D front end for Mosaic.  It is interesting
to look at and source code is available. 

  http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/weboogl/setup.html

One of the guys there, Ed Chi, is a into Linux and has been really 
helpful.  Weboogl is a proposed base for VRML (Virtual Reality 
Markup Language).  

I have only a 486DX 33mhz machine with 20 megs of ram and Geomview
really slows down when I  start to display things like offices 
and virtual worlds where there are many geometric shapes. 

If you do not have Motif, you will need Geomview linked with 
static binaries.  This file is 5 megs.  

A mean hack of a perl script connects Mosaic and Geomview.  To get the
script to run on Linux, you either need to run Perl 5.0 or change
one line of the script which sends a 'USR1' signal to Mosaic.

I think it was line 957 (or something like that).  The error message
will show where the problem is.  I didn't figure this out myself.  The
cool people at the Geometry center helped me.

Ah, nostalgia...

In the November 1992 issue of BYTE, page 24, there was a letter from
'David Giller - Los Angeles,CA' (a typo for 'David Miller'?) under the
title "Unix for Nothing", about Linux. It was the first time I heard
about It.
I think it was around 0.95 at that time - unfortunately I couldn't join
before 0.99.4, for lack of Internet access, but I was already alerted.
I wonder how many people were intrigued by that letter...

        Our install process uses cfdisk 0.8, and we also have regular
fdisk.  The only changes that we made to cfdisk were additional
user help and making the way it deals with segments above 1024
cylinders compatible with the old fdisk.

        If you prefer plain fdisk, there is nothing stopping you
from partitioning your disk with that as root and then just typing
"done" to the cfdisk part of the Yggdrasil installation script.

Hi all,

I know this is probably a simple question, but I could not find an answer in the FAQ.  I have /dev/lp1 set up correctly and it will take catted files, but it acts weird.  For example: it will not return to the beginning of the next line, it returns to the next at the end of the previous line. i.e.

"hi my name is andy
                   how are you doing
                                     I think this is a silly way to print files."

Is this a configuration problem or am I not catting the file correctly?

Help is appreciated.

   It seems that the HP9000 is not running the rpc.mountd and therfore
   cannot service NFS mount requests. Is the filesystem remote mounted

   Also the slashes should be / not \, but I don't know what problems

This helpful person, while treating us to his delightful rants, has 
deleted the actual question asked to begin with (which figures) so its 
kind of hard to help.

I'm running Yygdrasil  fall94 quite nicely. I am EXCEEDINGLY happy with 
it, the docs that came with it, and the Linux bible I bought that 
Yygdrasil publishes.

If whomever posted the original question would like to mail it to me, Ill
see if I can help. 

In a democracy everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion....
(I won't finish that thought.  Those of you out there inclined to agree 
with me will be able to finish it for yourselves, and this way I don't 
start a flame war with anyone else. :)  )

You were misinformed.  Both Linux and the BSD's use monolithic kernels. 
For a fun discussion of this, there is a series of articles were Linus
and Andy Tanenbaum 'discussed' the merits of both of these when Linux
was in it's infancy.

If your not seeing be thankful and provide your system configuration
so the experts can see whats working and whats not working

I am NOT seeing th problem,  Have a  14.4 modem using NET-3 pppd 2.2.2a with 
slackware 1.2 , and kernel 1.1.30.  I have downloaded 20 and 30 megs in a
single session via ftp and never had a problem.  I regularly rlogin to
other sites, once again without problem

Thanks, you are a life saver.  I was half way through
XF86-3.1-inc.tar.gz before the link completely froze. 
Anyways, I'll put XF86-3.1-Mach32.tar.gz, XF86-3.1-fntbig.tar.gz,
COPYRIGHT, FILES.gz, and SUMS on at:

  physics.purdue.edu:/pub/bcr/XFree86-3.1.

Between these two sites, people should be able to get most of
the XFree86 stuff.  To make things more convient I'll add some
links to my www homepage.

                         Bill

p.s.  I don't have room for the full distribution either, but
if people want to upload some of the missing drivers
to physics.purdue.edu:/pub/bcr/Incoming it should be OK.

Try increasing the cache read/write wait states...  I have a similiar setup 
and at 33 Mhz, works nicely but at 40Mhz, get errors compiling and random 
other little faults which eventually hose something important and the 
machine dies a rather entertaining death...
