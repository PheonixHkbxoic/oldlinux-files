DOS does not ship with rm, but many implementations of this nice program are
available. You can make DOS look exactly like a unix shell with some
tweaking. Shell scripts instead of batch file etc. Batch files can only be
run by giving their name as parameter to command.com.  The illusion only
breaks down if you hit the 640 K barrier or if you try to use the & operator
or want to fork a process or try to use a filename with 2 points in it.

        Consider the following sentence from section 2 of GPL2:

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    ^^^^^^^^^^
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.

        RMS has claimed, in gnu.misc.discuss article
<9307130434.AA01666@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu>, that he (paraphrasing)
considers use to be derivation, in certain circumstances, such as when
no non-GPLed code exists that gives the same interface as the GPLed
code under consideration.  In the same article, however, he gives a
specific definition for the phrase "interface copyright"; since the
FSF's usage retrictions don't fit that definition, then by golly, the
FSF is not pursuing an "interface copyright".

        The next questions are whether "independent" and "separate"
have generally accepted meanings in Copyright law, and whether the FSF
has some wriggle room through this phrase.

        Note also that RMS' expressed interpretation of the GPL gives
the implication that there may exist works (which at some time have
been subsections of some whole work incorporating a GPLed Program)
that are not derived from the GPLed Program, but which are not
"reasonably separate and independent" of the GPLed Program; GPL2 is
applied to these subsections via the sentence above (in spite of the
fact that the subsections are not themselves derived from any GPLed
code).  This gives rise to the observation that the GPL may be a virus
that can infect non-GPLed code.

Hi Ken!  I had the same problem using the pow() function from
the math library.  You need to include a '-lm' on your command line
so that the math library is linked in. 

e.g.  gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lm

this should fix it for you.

I've been wondering the same thing.  I'm developing a distributed
fuzzy neural network (using RPC, and TCPIP, and Internet) with a fancy
X-windows interface.  It is intended to be portable and eventually run
on a variety of platforms, including PC's... assuming they ever
adopt a native multi-tasking OS.  Anyway, I need a good unix development
environment, that's also cheap.  I've lot's of experience with
SunOS and SysV-R4, but know virtually nothing aobut QNX, Linux, and FreeBSD.
Because the eventual target market is "everyman", I can't select an
expensive, development environment, like NextStep or SunOS, unless I can
ensure easy portability to "free" unix and PC machines later.  The
programming is being done using C++.  Networking hooks are required.

recommendations anyone? (please support your position, also)

Thanks.

Actually, 0 is an invalid component of a node number.  It is the broadcast
address in BSD4.2, so it's a bad idea to try to use it on a machine, not
to mention violating RFC 791 and the host requirements one...

ftp to rs.internic.net, cd netinfo, ftp internet-number-template.txt.

They'll be happy to assign you a network number.  Or, your internet
provider may have netblocks already allocated.

<soapbox on>

RFC 1597 suggests a solution for _unconnected_ internets (which yours is
_NOT_).  Ignore it.  The authors are out of their collective minds.  See
RFC 1627 for a rebuttal.

I agree.  Waterloo Maple Software usually charges about $2000 for
the UNIX version of Maple.  At US$595 for Maple for Linux, they're
charging exactly the same as for a full Windows version.

However, it's still a lot of money :-(

           product.

He may well have read it, but not everything he reads is true.
I promise you he didn't read it in Linux Journal

1) Linus will make no such decision because he believes that
putting Linux under the GPL is one of the best decisions he
ever made.  He said so in an interview in Linux Journal.

2) Linux can't make that decision because the copyright to
a large amount of the kernel is held by other people, some
of which will not allow their code to be held under any copyright
other than the GPL, and none of which would be pleased with
a decision to go commercial.

I have periodic postings to several usenet usegroups, including
comp.os.linux.announce, comp.os.linux.misc, and news.answers
which specifically state that Linux will always be free.  Also,
Linux Journal (of which I am the editor) has published several
pieces relating to this, including the previously mentioned
interview.

           He stated "nope, 
           Linux itelf will go commerical... It will no longer be 
           a public freeware/public domain OS,  but a commercial OS", 

He is completely wrong.  Well, not completely.  It is not public
domain now, and never will be.  It is protected by the GNU copyleft,
a copyright which *prohibits* people other than the copyright holder
from limiting free distribution of the protected software.  Since
multiple people hold copyright on parts of the Linux kernel, and
at least some of those people will not consider changing their
copyrights, Linux will remain under the protection of the GPL.

However, Linux will remain "freeware"; publically available at
no charge.  Please tell your boss he is free to send me email
with any questions he has about this, and I'll answer him.

It used to be....but it isn't now.  Linus settled the issue once and for
all early this year.  Ftp a copy of english.au or swedish.au from sunsite
(I don't remember the exact path...sorry).  Then cat this file to
/dev/audio (assuming you have your sound card and drivers installed).

You will quite clearly hear Linus giving both the pronunciation of his name
and of Linux (i.e., ``Hello, this is Linus Torvalds, and I pronounce Linux
as Linux.'').  It's Linux, as in a short 'i' sound (rhymes with ``in'').
Actually, to me, it almost has a long 'e' sound---it's almost like a cross
between a short 'i' and a long 'e'.  The closest pronunciation for an
American-English speaker is the short 'i' sound, though.  The long 'i'
pronunciation is completely out of the picture.

Subject: how to set up my Linux box as a GATEWAY?
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 00:40:28 GMT


Greetings, *.

I've put together a little home network, consisting of several DOS PC's 
(running TCP/IP packages) and my Linux box.  I have my own set of IP 
addresses assigned from the NIC (192.160.60.xxx, Class C).

My Linux machine has a PPP connection (through a local Internet service 
provider) to the rest of the Internet.

I would like my Linux box to act as a "gateway" between my local 
network, and the rest of the Internet.

The details:

All of my machines are assigned addresses in the 192.160.60.xxx range.

My Internet service provider assigns my Linux box it's own address when 
it dials in -- usually something like 199.201.128.101.

All of the DOS PC's are set so that they use my Linux box as the gateway 
(i.e. if you try to use an IP address not on the local network, it gets 
sent through the gateway).

Picture of network setup:

Can anyone help me out here?  How do I set up my /etc/rc.d/* scripts, 
network configs (/etc/hosts, /etc/networks, etc.) for this configuration?

Please respond by email (picard@silcom.com) -- thanks!

You must have the June (Red) edition.  They did not produce an August
edition.  Meantime Walnut Creek had an August release of their Linux
Toolkit, is that what you have?

Due to their move from NJ to AZ, their August edition has become their
September edition, and even that has been delayed.

We are currently being promised that the next edition will be delivered to
us on October 10 from the factory.

Cheers,  Bob.

xterm, for example, is also SUID root, and by typing 'xterm -C' one can
have a look at the console.

PPP would be nice, too :-)

'splain *everything*: what the functional equivalents are, how to use them, 
etc.  This sounds like the kind of thing that I wish I'd had....
