I saw a posting in comp.os.solaris recently about assigning multiple
IP addresses to the same adapter! (on a SparcStation with Solaris 2.x)

This was done in order to route something across the same physical network
without the need for an extra adapter. The second "virtual" adapter was
referred to as le0:1, the ":1" part appended to the original adapter name.
Though a bit unusual, there's nothing wrong with this I think.
I suppose there are no plans yet for implementing this feature in linux.

What might be simpler, is to provide a standard set of ioctls and read writes

Unfortunately, it's not possible to read Apple-format floppies with a
PC drive, due to the variable-speed problems you mentioned (I think
Apple disks are GCR-encoded as well).

Do you have access to a Macintosh anywhere?  All Macs with recent OS
versions can read and write Apple II 3.5" disks as well as MS-DOS
disks.  Just insert each disk in turn, and copy the files-- the

Please note that most of the questions in c.o.l.help and in the 
comp.os.unix.* groups are answered in the respective faqs.  R'ing TFM
is something most people are reluctant to do.  (The Linux stuff is a 
relatively easy read, with a very high signal to noise ratio.)

Of course, this question begs for an answer from the PC hardware 
groups... but I'll throw my two humble bits in anyway. :^)

[ summary of answers relating to the 16M question deleted. ]

Simple: the cache has an overhead.  A cache miss takes much longer than 
the memory access time.  First we look if its in the cache.  We decide 
its not, we send out a query.  This overhead is significant- a small (L2) 
cache is worse than none at all.  

It seems to me, this implies that Linux has a lower locality of 
reference than ms.w.doze.  
  
Ms-doze, as a different OS, would have different locality of reference 
characteristics than Linux.  Hardware manufacturers of PC stuff will tend 
to optimize for ms.Doze.  

We compensate with differnet buying patterns: ie. better busses, more 
memory, more cache, slower cpus.

YMMV,
Henry

I got a Dell Optiplex 590 that works fine. It has the Intel Neptune

I've also installed Linux 1.1.49 on a Plato / Neptune board. We had
problems with the original bios (version X.X.3)  but an upgrade (to
X.X.10) solved that. I'm running it with:
        Orchid Kelvin 64 on PCI
        SMC Ultra on ISA
        FD 1650 SCSI on ISA

There's a small problem cleaning up when X shuts down - the text mode

Linux supports ISA-bus memory, but if you already have 16 megs or more
it won't work because only the low 24 bits of address space can be
accessed from the ISA bus.  It will also be unacceptably slow.

I've never seen a VESA local-bus memory expansion card-- do such
things exist?  If they did that would be a viable means of expansion,
but with the low prices on CPU-less motherboards these days you should
probably just swap yours out for one with more simm sockets.

You need to edit the kernel Makefile and change the RAMDISK macro 
to read:

RAMDISK = -DRAMDISK=1440

Then rebuild the kernel.

This defines a ramdisk which is the same size as the diskette. If you
boot from a diskette using this kernel and a lilo label of "ramdisk", then
linux will automatically create the ramdisk and copy the diskette
contents to it, thus making the ramdisk the root drive.

You do not need to use dd to copy the kernel to the diskette. Simply
create a filesystem on the diskette and copy the kernel in the normal
way using cp. Use lilo to make the diskette bootable. My lilo config
file is:

boot = /dev/fd0
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
compact
image = /floppy/Image
        label = ramdisk
        ramdisk = 1440
        root= /dev/fd0

This config assumes that the boot diskette is mounted at /floppy
and the kernel on it is called "Image".

There may be other ways of doing it. I have done it this way and it works.

It does not have to be a Minix filesystem on the boot diskette. It was 
probably used for the early distributions because it was simple, and
it was the first one up and running, but it does not have to be Minix.
I have set up my own boot diskettes with an ext2 filesystem, and it
works fine.

My recommendation:  get a better motherboard, one that can handle
more memory (up to 128MB is not uncommon these days), regardless of whether
Linux can handle a bus memory board or not.

Reasoning:  putting memory on your bus limits memory access rates to bus
rates AT BEST; in practice, speeds are even lower because of bus contention.
Your regular memory areas are on the order of 100 times faster than an
ISA bus, again at their theoretical best.

No. Things evolves very quickly in the compilers domain.
Use GCC(G++) 2.6.0, and you will be able to differentiate implementation
and declaration. However, you have to #include <decl_filename.cxx> which is
not very clean, but it works. 

For more information, have a look at gnu.gcc.help newsgroup.
If people is interested, I can download gcc2.6.0 on a site. I think
people at sunsite wait for gcc to be more stable. (I don't aggree since
it's as usable as gcc2.5.8, I compiled kernel 1.1.45 yesterday)

Oh that's a classic that is.

Thanks for brightening up my otherwise dull day.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !
