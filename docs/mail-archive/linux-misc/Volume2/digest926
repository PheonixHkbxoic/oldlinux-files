It seems that the HP9000 is not running the rpc.mountd and therfore
cannot service NFS mount requests. Is the filesystem remote mounted
on any other machine?

Also the slashes should be / not \, but I don't know what problems
that will cause.

What are the options for Motif under Linux?  I haven't found anything for
free, though it would make it easier to compile Xmosaic and a few other
things.  I haven't found anything about commercial versions either.  I'm
interested in getting Motif one way or the other.

Subject: specifying routes
Date: 12 Oct 1994 16:28:34 -0600

I am running a Linux 1.1.52 system on an Everex 486DX2-50 with a 
Western Digital WD8003 ethernet card with Net-3.  Lately I have been having
routing problems with tcp/ip traffic a few gateways downstream. 
Is there anyway to route ip traffic by hand around these gateways?
My ethernet card is configured as follows:

# ifconfig eth0
eth0      IP ADDR 129.238.8.33  BCAST 129.238.8.255  NETMASK 255.255.252.0
          MTU 1500  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
          FLAGS: 0x0043 ( UP BROADCAST RUNNING )

My routing tables and eth0 interface are set up with the following 
commands at boot time:

ifconfig eth0 129.238.8.33 netmask 255.255.252.0 broadcast 129.238.8.255
route add -net network
route add default gw router metric 0  

# netstat -r
Kernel routing table
Destination net/address   Gateway address           Flags RefCnt    Use Iface
default                   router                    UGN        0    213 eth0
network                   *                         UN         0    230 eth0


I have ignored the loopback interface for conciseness. Can anyone help?

Thanks

When I demo my Linux box to folks, they're often impressed when they're
running Mosaic, click on a link, and hear audio.

Similarly, if you run a sufficiently studly MIME mailer (Messages,
metamail), you can exchange MIME mail that contains audio.

There's no shortage of Unix database programs.  What I suspect you

Using TrueType requires paying Apple big money, doesn't it.  On the

1) Games are so much better.
2) combined with my CD drive, it makes for a decent sound system in my

3) Gives me MIDI access to my synth.

Subject: Laserjet 4 success
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 00:52:52 GMT

This is a mini-howto related to making a Laserjet 4m+ connected to the 
local ethernet functional with Linux. It was a "novell printer" according 
to our MIS department but then I found the manual..........  ;^)
( this enables printing with the lpr command )
( most of this is adapted from the jetdirect manual )

To enable LaserJet 4m+ network printer to print from Linux machine,
perform the following actions as root:


Add:

text|lj1_text:Laserjet 4m+ (text mode) on local subnet: \
        :lp=: \
        :rm=laserjet1: \
        :rp=text: \
        :lf=/var/spool/lpd/text/errs: \
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/text/lj1_text:
        
        
raw|lj1_raw:Laserjet 4m+ (PostScript) on local subnet: \
        :lp=: \
        :rm=laserjet1: \
        :rp=raw: \
        :lf=/var/spool/lpd/raw/errs: \
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/raw/lj1_raw:

to /etc/printcap

Add something like:
146.174.64.60 laserjet1.qntm.com laserjet 
to /etc/hosts

Note that you have to have chosen a valid IP address for your printer and 
have configured the IP address/netmask/default gateway previously via the 
front panel. 

mkdir /var/spool/lpd/text
mkdir /var/spool/lpd/raw
chown daemon.daemon  /var/spool/lpd/text
chown daemon.daemon  /var/spool/lpd/raw
chmod g+w  /var/spool/lpd/text
chmod g+w  /var/spool/lpd/raw
mkdir /var/spool/lpd/text/lj1_text
mkdir /var/spool/lpd/raw/lj_raw 
chown daemon.daemon  /var/spool/lpd/raw/lj_raw 
chown daemon.daemon /var/spool/lpd/text/lj1_text
chmod g+w  /var/spool/lpd/raw/lj_raw/
chmod g+w  /var/spool/lpd/text/lj1_text 


To test the printer, try lpr -Ptext /etc/printcap for text mode.
To test PostScript, try lpr -Praw your-postscript-file.

To check print queue status, try lpq -Ptext or lpq -Praw as appropriate.

Subject: ATA or SCSI !!
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 01:03:22 GMT

Using Mark Lords excellent hdparms program, I captured the following 
results from my machine. It has two disk drives, one ATA and the other 
SCSI. The funny thing about these drives is that except for the firmware 
and interface, they are identical.

One is a Quantum LPS540 ATA and the other is a Quantum LPS540 SCSI.

The computer is a brand x 486-66 clone running Linux 1.1.50 with no 
special patches. It has 16 MB of RAM and during the test was running 
Xwindows but doing nothing special (about 40 processes). The ATA 
interface is built into the motherboard and is considered ISA type. The 
SCSI interface is a Adaptec 1542CF set for 5.0 MB/sec, negotiate 
Synchcronous. (Who knows if it was really running sync or not!)

The results show the ATA setup slightly faster than the SCSI but at the 
expense of 2 to 3 times the CPU bandwidth. Anybody want guess the results 
if someone else logged in during the tests? ;^)

You should not use TeX.  LaTeX is  much easier, well, it is big, but
I found it simple.  

After  my  first  steps  I took a timer and reformatted a 2 two page
ascii text (with some  chemical  formulas)  to  a text with a title,
tableofcontents,  footnotes, etc.  10 min.  (Ok, so it wasn't a long
text, but remember I  had  to  conver  the german special characters
etc)

To make a long story short, I tried the  same  the  next  day  using
WinWord  at  a  friends  computer.   Took me about an hour to get it
somewhat close to the LaTeX output, then I gave up.

So LaTeX can't be _that_ complicated;-)

The main difference  between  these  two  is  that  LaTeX  is a text
formatter (WYWIWYG), while WinWord is a WYSIWYG editor.
You write the input for LaTeX  using  any  ascii  editor  (I  prefer
JOE/JED)  and  then  LaTeX  parses it.  (Actually, LaTeX is "just" a
macro package for TeX, but it makes things really  easy,  while  not
losing any power)
LaTeX generates a .dvi file which then can be viewed or printed.

Hey, I like it;-) 

I  would  recommend:  try it at least.  Go to your next library, and
get an introduction to LaTeX.   (I  could recommend one, but only if
you understand german;)

If you don't like it - what have you lost?
If you like it       - what have you won!

Does anybody have patches for allowing setuid shell scripts?
Like many other Linux users, the only reason I even have a *user*

So, I don't care if setuid scripts are unsecure. As long as I can't
