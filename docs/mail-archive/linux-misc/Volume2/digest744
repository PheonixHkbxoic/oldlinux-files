You can redefine all of the key commands.  I haven't figured out
what the keycodes are supposed to be for non-ASCII keys, but you
can put the ASCII value of a normal key after the key_* tag in
the .doomrc to use that key for a keyboard command; i.e. if you
wanted to use the 'a' key for key_fire, then put 97 after the
key_fire tag in your .doomrc.

I upgraded my Linux 1.0.9 kernel with the Voxware 2.90
distribution on sunsite (including the two provided patch files)
and I get good sound.  The only problem seems to be that I
sometimes get "delayed echoes"; a fragment of the end of a sound
will sometimes reoccur up to a couple of seconds after it
originally finished.

What I really miss is using the mouse.  I switched to using the
mouse some time ago during a period when I was doing a lot of
intense deathmatch play, and while I have gotten a little better
at using the keyboard in the Linux version, I tried running the
DOS version again with the mouse and it was _so_ much easier to
do things.  I just can't seem to find the right layout for the
key commands that lets me comfortably run, turn, strafe, and fire
all at the same time even half as well as I can with the
mouse/keyboard combination.

It appears to me that the 38400 mark is just a convention.  You can
have the serial driver reinterpret it as 57600 by using the spd_hi
option with the setserial command.  What you are doing, in this case,
is sending data at 57600 bits per second to the modem, which compres-
ses it, then sends it at 9600(+?) baud over the phone to another modem
that decompresses it.  V.42bis compression can achive a 4:1 ratio, so
57600 is an ideal rate.  You must enable rts/cts flowcontrol, though,
I believe, since otherwise you can overflow the modem's buffers (if,
say, it can't quite reach 4:1 compression, but is getting stuff in
at the maximum rate of 57600).

I might remind everyone reading this that I'm no guru (if that's not
obvious).  I just had this incredible brainstorm that maybe the FAQs,
HOWTOs, and man pages might have something useful to say.  I'm always
the first to encourage old hands to be nice.  But the crabby netters
who go around screaming RTFM do have a point.

Subject: S3 boards with less than 1MB...
Date: 11 Sep 1994 10:57:26 GMT

Note followups...

This weekend I took an apparently useless graphics board out of an old
386 and put in a cheap ISA S3 board I picked up.

Interestingly enough, the apparently useless graphics board is _also_ an
S3 board.

The one I pulled has the S3-911 chip on it, and a measely 256K of memory.
It's expandable to 512K.

Question:  will XFree86 drive an S3 board with only half a meg?  It sure
won't drive one with 256K, but I am wondering if it is worthwhile scrounging
the extra 256K of VRAM.

Cheers,
RNA

P.S. the graphics transplant into the 386 went well, and I am now turning
the machine over to my fellow students to let them pound on it as a
linux-X-terminal...  You can finger it at gsb-linux-352.stanford.edu
(36.67.0.214) if you've got nothing better to do!

Tell Linux that the modem is 38400. This should work fine with a Sportster.
The line speed is still 14400, but the serial port speed (computer to modem)
is higher. This has to be in order to get any use out of compression. If you
use minicom, be sure to set auto baud detect off, and ALWAYS use hardware
flow control at these (relatively) high speeds.

One word of caution - be SURE to power the sportster off before plugging/
unplugging the power supply - I have had THREE of these modems fry this way.
And I had one power supply decide to send a bunch more volts than usual one
day - also fried the modem. IMHO, these cheap modems are just that - cheap.

I've been responding with what little I know about the Diamond situation via 
email to folk, but since it keeps comign up, I thought Ild make one 
public post.  The following is from Yygdrasil's installation guide and
Linux Bible.

The basic problem with Diamond is that they use a propritary interface to the
clocks, something that any X driver needs access to to set the board.
They will only give this information under an NDA (non-disclosure agreement).
The NDA, if signed, makes it impossible to publish source for any driver
that might be written.  This not only violates the GPL, but makes it
really hard to include as a linux driver (I guess you COULD just provide
a linkable object file, but that violates the entire way Linux is managed.)

The overall reaction of the free-software community has been "fine, if 
you don't want to support us, then we won't waste any effort trying to 
support you."  This is really quite reasonable given the above.

The suggestion I've been giving others is to call Diamond and complain.  
Maybe if enough customers complain, they'll realize that they are losing 
business over this and reconsider.

As I say, the above is my understanding, gelaned from the Yygdrasil 
position.  Anyone who finds mistakes in the above feel free to correct me.

        Well I have been trying unsuccessfully tonight to get to
        sunsite.unc.edu to download the fixed pixel doubling version
        of Linux Doom but all I got were weird messages after I 
        connected. Any thing like dir, ls, or get produced an error
        message about unable to open port (150.2.22.81,20) already in
        use. So I just tried it a min. ago and now sunsite is off the
        net (i.e. ping returns 100% packet loss)! I wonder if the
        presence of Linux Doom on the server and all the connections I 
        imagine have been made there to get it, have any thing to do
        with the crash? If someone wants a good indication of how many
        people are using Linux I would guess the ftp logs from sunsite
        for the past couple of days would be a good indication!

Well, I took Martin up on that, pointing out my interpretation of

Neither I nor anybody else (as far as I remember) asked for WP to

too pursue that line in the direction of waving lawyers around.

This thing has already been discussed a lot in this group.  The result
was, that X can be quite fast, too, that X is more a unix standard
(doom also runs on SGI and NextStep), and that X works over a network.

XFree86 uses floating point only, when needed, like for drawing
circles.  Ghostscript uses it a lot view, so you should be able
to speed it up with a coprocessor.

Well, they use the standard CD-ROM file system.  However, all files
in the /usr/src tree are compressed with gzip.  Usually you do not
need these files, unless you want to recompile part or all of the
system.  Then you have two choices:

- Copy them to harddisk, and uncompress with gunzip.
- Use the special libc provided to decompress these files on the
  fly when you access them.

It depends on what you do.  I upgraded my 386-40 to a 486-33 this summer
because I was doing a lot of work with neural nets.  With only floating point
emulation the nets took hours to complete on the 386-40; they complete in
minutes or seconds on the 486-33 (Which has a built-in co-processor).

In general, more RAM will help more.  So will more disk space and a faster

I know it is bad form to followup on myself...  But I figure I better
head-off all the useless replies.  It seems that the /proc file system
lists ports being used, so now I know DOOM uses the 5029 udp port.
Unfortunately, it acts as a daemon as well as a client.  This means
if you do something like:

linuxxdoom -net 1 localhost

DOOM will try to talk to itself.  So tudpredir won't help.  The obvious
solution would be to recompile DOOM with -include termnet.h and -ltermnet.
If someone at ID feels motivated and has term 2 installed this might
happen, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting.  Another way
to get term support would be to do zlibc type trick and patch your
C library.  However, I've been warned this trick is very risky so
I haven't tried it with term.

I'll continue to think about this and maybe I will think of another
solution.

Subject: DOOM for Linux

PLEASE let's keep doom traffic that isn't related to features of the Linux
operating system (it is 'comp.os.linux...' after all) to one of the games
groups.  I can see DOOM posting getting out of proportion here - specially
as the posters seem to be a little heavy-handed with the cross-posting.
