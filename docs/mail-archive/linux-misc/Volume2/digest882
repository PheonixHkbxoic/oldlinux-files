For me WYSIWYG is critical.  Critical.  Like many scholars in the humanities,
I'm citing documents in languages other than English, and it's terribly irk-
some to have to enter text in these languages using a cumbersome nonnative
notation.  I just use a WYSIWYG editor that lets me change keyboards on the
fly.  One minute I'm touch typing English.  Another I'm entering Arabic or
Hebrew or whatever I need.  And I see what I'm typing as it normally should
be seen, i.e., without all the formatting crap and with foreign characters
in the correct font.

Of course, this is all moot for Linux, since there *is* no multilingual word
processor for Unix (though some stabs are being made in that direction).  It
seems that the programming/engineering/CS community is pretty much a mono-
lingual culture (at least here in the US).

So maybe for them ASCII-based typesetters are fine.

Is the Linux for the PPC project a hoax? Promised delivery of kernel was
August when the project was supposedly started, then September in the Linux
FAQ. I know it is difficult to port software written specifically for the
X86 to another platform and it does take time. The silence about this project
leads me to think the software is vaporware. If the project is real then we 
have some real status reports like the Linux ports to other platforms. Thanks

Two things to keep in mind: If you are stuck with a low power supply
voltage, you lower the speaker impedance gives more power. If your SB_PRO
does 2 watts with 8 ohm speakers, it can do 4 watts with 4 ohm speakers.
Ford uses 3.2 watt speakers so we can get higher power levels in 12 volt
car stereos.

Second: speakers efficiencies vary over a tremendous range. There are
speakers that can produce more sound with 4 watts than other speakers can
produce using 400 watts! I don't know what the efficiency of SONIC
speakers is: are they the type of small speakers with plastic cases that
typicallly come with multimedia bundles? A nice pair of Koss bookshelf 
speakers could probably beat their efficiency by a factor of 10.

Then make sure you realy have WYSIWYG. That is not allways the case with
MS-DOS/windows SW. Here in Norway we only have 6 special characters not
found in english (Ê¯Â∆ÿ≈) but still after more than 10 years with
personal computers it is amassing how often you see the japanese yen
character in stead of the norwegian ¯ {\o}. This happens in the printing
process. (Also I've found that not all greek characters are found in
all printer fonts.)

Personally I prefer WYWIWYG (what you write is what you get) i.e. LaTeX

There's something called Accelerated X, or Xcelerator or something like
that for many 80x86 platforms (including linux) for about $199. If
you look in the XFree86 P9000 documentation there's a reference to it,
and they've been advertising in Linux Journal.

        I had a problem with the Yggdrasil install during partitioning.
It decided that my freshly formatted SCSI disk had a partition table.
The table appeared corrupted as displayed but I could not fix it.
I attempted to use DOS fdisk.   It saw a partition table as well, but
it displayed as obvioulsy corrupted data.   I found a DOS partition utility
on Simtel that could write a valid table.   Then linux installed and
partitioned correctly.

        The formatting of SCSI disks is handled entirely by the drive.
The controller only issues a format command and waits for completion.
The data pattern remaining after format will be different on different
drives.   Some of these patterns can be confused with a partition table.
The linux partition utility needs to have the ability to initialize
a partition table on command from the user.   There is obviously some
danger in this but it is the only way to handle the case of certain
format patterns as well as corrupted partition tables.   The DOS fdisk
needs it too.

On the 286, you'll need a terminal program (Qmodem, Telix, etc...)
Get a null-modem cable to connect the machines.

In your /etc/inittab, create or uncomment a line that says

s1:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 19200 ttyS1
                           ^^^^^ ^^^^^
                            (1)    (2)

1)  Change to the highest speed you can reliably receive                          |
2)  Change to which serial port you want to hang the 286 off of.

Then do an init 4 or init 5 (or just reboot), and you should get a login
prompt on the terminal.
