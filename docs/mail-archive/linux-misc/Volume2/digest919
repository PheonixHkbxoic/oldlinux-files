Subject: Mystery Chip...AMD
Date: Wed, 5 Oct 1994 21:44:41 GMT

While responding to an add inteh local paper for a $99 486 upgrade it came
to light that this upgrade was a quote "486/66 Mhz" which was a "faster chip and less expensive than the i486DX2-66". This propted my query on what the hell
this chip was and the response was AMD. I was not aware of this chip. I was
under the impression that all the 66's 75's 100's etc (non-Pentium) were 
overclocked 33 Mhz chips. Does a 'real' 66 Mhz chip exist? If so (and I dont'
think so" do traditional mother boards ( ie that could handle a DX2) support
this chip. And Finally, if this is true is it compatble and reliable.

INquiring minds want to know!! ;-))
Thanks...Colin

Is there anyone using S3 86C805 on Linux X11R6 XFree86 3.0? I have
installed linux using Yggdrasil Fall 1994 release, and found that
the video does not work after exiting from X window.  What happens
is that the screen will be black except the cursor after exiting from
X window.  Do I need a new driver?  Does anyone have the same problem?

The video card I use is miroCrystal 10SD using the S3 80C805 chip set.

I'm about to purchase a P54c system from Dell, and it is being shipped with
a 540 Meg drive..  I've heard that Linux had trouble with 540 IDE drives. 
I'd like to devote this disk entirely to Linux (no need for DOS/Win :)
Any info?

Subject: NCR SCSI and NEC 2Xi
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 20:23:38 +0100 (BST)

I've been running OS/2 quite happily on my system using the NCR SCSI chipset
and I'm now considering buying a CD-ROM drive. I have been told that the NEC
is not as fast as many double speed drives but it seems to me that there
would be an advantage (financial mainly but also in config matters) in going
for the NEC 2Xi.

Has anyone had any experience with this particular combination - does it
give satisfactory performance, are there any incompatibility problems with
software/hardware/CD-ROMs (I've been told that some drives won't read some
disks).

Comments on this combination for Linux would also be appreciated.

As always, email responses would be preferred to follow-ups.

Thank you all for any help you can give me.

I don't see what is so ridiculous in trying to get free advice by
posting on Internet. I don't know about your friends who "need a few
dollars to fall their way", but a few experiences with that kind of
people have shown me that *if and when* they enter in a library or
some such institution where the staff self-admittedly has not much
experience, they just grab as much money as they can and run.  If
there is a recipe-for-disaster then that is hiring people to do a job
you yourself have not oriented yourself in (mmm... this sentence will
not get me the Nobel prize for literature, but it should be clear).

Funny thing is: one of the best IR-systems (Salton's SMART) actually
can be downloaded for free. It compiles on Linux too! So why should
Robert fork out tens of thousands of dollars to obtain this knowledge?

You're right about this -- the command you can use to set this

Post a warning when you are certain about the possibility of danger.

What you posted was complete conjecture, an uncertain warning to a
public newsgroup.  It would have been better to send a query to the
XFree86 developers so that they could investigate the problem and
issue a warning if necessary.

Reply-To: bubbly@vnet.ibm.com

Based on recent experience, I'd highly recommend Fintronic as a provider of
systems pre-configured with Linux.  I purchased the following:

  - Intel 486DX2-66MHz VLB basic system
  - Buslogic KT-445S VLB SCSI Controller w/ ASPI DOS drivers
  - 1.0GB, Quantum Empire 1080S, 9ms, 512K cache, 3.5x1"
  - Conner Viper 2525S 525MB 1/4" SCSI tape
  - Viewsonic 17, 17", 1280x1024
  - #9 GXE Level 11 VLB 2MB, S3-928
  - DOS 6.2/Windows 3.1 installed with dual boot (via LILO)

For slightly less than $4100 (including shipping).

Notes:

They said they'd ship 11 days after taking my order... and ended up missing
this by 10 days.  They were, however, courteous enough to call before the
original ship date to let me know that it was being held up.  The delay
seemed reasonable in light of their having recently gotten favorable press in
Byte magazine.

All hardware documentation (motherboard, harddrive, controller, video card,
tape drive, monitor) and related diskettes were included and well organized.
The latest version of a few Linux docs were also included.

The machine worked flawlessly right out of the box.  Within the first hour of
powerup I was in X, compiling, downloading stuff from my online service via
'seyon', and even sneaking a peek at a few jpeg's via 'xv'.

One thing that really sticks in my mind (having dealt with "take the money and
run" suppliers in the past) is that they didn't bill my credit card until the
day they shipped the system.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !
