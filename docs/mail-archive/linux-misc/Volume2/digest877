Still, it is not as if style sheets can't be done using major word proces-
sors.  And I'm not sure that TeX is really the right thing to bring up for
average users.  It's just not a word processor in the sense that most of
us use those words.  Any system that separates editing from viewing just
adds another gratuitous layer of indirection to the process of producing
documents.

There are at least two: spog and pgbrowse.  The later is a graphical
browser for postgres tables.  You can use it for looking up data in
a table, or entering new data:

Subject: New book for Linux!
Date: Tue,  4 Oct 1994 09:10:00 -0400

Well, I just heard of it.  In the October CACM on page 43 is an ad from
Springer-Verlag for _Linux_-_Unleashing_the_Workstation_in_Your_PC_. 
The cover has a picture of a "Friends don't let friends use DOS" button
:).

The blurb:
"Linux has emerged as a viable alternative to commercial UNIX systems,
with its ability to turn a 386/486-PC into a UNIX workstation with
performance characteristics comparable to a RISC workstation.  As the
definitive guide to Linux, this book instoduces the concepts and
features of Linux and explains how to install and configure the system. 
Moveover, it describes the features and services of the Internet which
have been instrumental in the rapid development and wide distribution of
Linux.  This book focuses on the Linux graphical interface, its network
capability and extended tools.  Using the book, readers can get started
quickly with Linux and begin to explore a wide range of shareware
applications that are available for the system."

1994/238 pp., 50 illus./Softcover $29.95
ISBN 0-387-58077-8

You can order directly from S-V at 800-SPRINGER (NJ: 201-348-4033), FAX
201-348-4505, reference S966.  It includes a 30-day return privilege.


Note: I have no connection with Springer-Verlag.  I've never actually
seen the book.  Caveat emptor.  I just think it's cool that Linux is
getting coverage like this.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Subject: What GNU Tutorials would you attend?

We are thinking of having a GNU technical seminar in Cambridge,
Massachusetts next April or May.  One day will be a series of talks,
mostly technical overviews; the following day we are thinking of
having tutorials.  Tentatively we plan to charge $300 for the day of
talks, and $180 for each half day tutorial (students 1/4 price).
(These prices may change; consider them order-of-magnitude estimates.)
The funds raised, beyond the cost of the seminar itself, will go to
support GNU development.

To plan the tutorials, we need to find out what tutorial topics people
are interested in.  Here are the topics we are thinking about.

* Emacs Lisp programming.
* Advanced Emacs editing.
* Hurd programming.
* Using GNU Make, Bison, and Flex.
* Writing documentation in Texinfo.
* The Linux kernel.
* Using Autoconf to write portable programs.
* Porting GCC.

If you think you would actually attend one or more of these tutorials,
please send mail to gnu-tutorials@gnu.ai.mit.edu and tell us which
ones.  We'll use the response to figure out which tutorials to offer,
and how to schedule them.

Subject: REQ: MIDI-sequencer for Linux
Date: 4 Oct 1994 14:11:20 +0100

Hi!

Regarding the low prices for hardware and possible performance I'm
thinking about buying a Linux-system.

Very important for making my decision is the existance of a
(semi)professional MIDI-sequencer like Sibelius 7 (Acorn Archimedes),
Bars & Pipes (Commodore Amiga) or anything similar to these ones known
on Atari or Apple Macintosh.

Recommended:
- GUI
- good timing, even at high loads
- high comfort concerning manipulation of MIDI-events (note-data,
  velocity, aftertouch etc.)
- flexibility concerning the usable synthesizers (much interest in
  compatibility to Technics KN-800, Roland JV-30 and Kord 01/W)

Would be nice:
- more than 24 tracks
- Output of completely formatted note sheets (as a preview or even
  better as DTP, maybe an interface to MusicTeX)

Already existant? I'm sure, but how's the quality? I would be very
pleased if some like-minded people would reply for a small chat...

Oh yes, I'm likely to buy a Intel 486 DX-II/66 (maybe important for
                                                      performance :)

We have a very heterogeneous network with the Operating Systems :
Solaris, Sun-Os, Os2, DOS/WINDOWS, MAC-OS, CLIX,OS 400, IRIX, AIX, HP-UX,
sco-xenix, linux, ... 
Linux can easy be used as a print server for most of the OS's .
Most of the unix/os2 systems print to the linux-box using lpr (berkley printing
 system), and the dos/windows systems print files whith pcnfs own printing mechanism .
It would be very nice if I can find an implementation of the system-V print spooling
for linux, because there are some unix systems which only have a system-V style print spooling implemented!
Any information is appreciated !
