  Linux Commercial-HOWTO
  Harald Milz, hm@ix.de
  September 26, 1994

  This document contains commercial software and applications which are
  offered for Linux. It is maintained by Harald Milz
  (http://www.ix.de/editors/hm.html) (hm@ix.de).

  1.  Introduction

  This is the Linux Commercial-HOWTO. It contains commercial application
  software which is available for Linux. The Commercial-HOWTO will not
  contain Linux distributions and related stuff -- that's what the
  Distribution-HOWTO is for.

  This HOWTO will contain tabular entries for each product.  The entry
  format is similar to the new Linux Software Map (LSM) entry
  (field/stanza lengths are arbitrary). The sample entries are just
  examples.  Please: KEEP SHORT. Otherwise I'll have to shorten your
  data, and I hate work. ;-)



     Description:
        SHORT description of the package, just the basic functionality


     Distribution Media:
        diskettes, CD-ROM, tapes or others


     Licensing Policy:
        whatever applies. is there a free demo or shareware version
        available via FTP?  Where?


     OS Provisions:
        kernel version, XFree86 version, Motif version, RAM and harddisk
        usage


     Documentation:
        printed documentation, page number, online help, language


     Product Support:
        update service, maintenance, training and prices thereof


     Linux Support:
        if you bundle a complete Linux system with your software, which
        kind of support do you offer for the operating system? prices?


     Extra Features and Add-Ons:
        and their prices


     Available Since:
        the date you started shipping the Linux version


     Countries with Distribution:
        if you ship in too many countries to name them all, naming
        regional distribution channels is okay.

     Price Range:
        whatever it costs


     Installed Base:
        how many copies of the Linux version did you sell?


     Vendor:

          address

          phone

          fax

          e-mail address

          contact person



  I'll post the list to several national and international newsgroups on
  a monthly basis. In addition, the Commercial-HOWTO will be available
  via FTP and FSP (port 21): ftp.ix.de:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO (the latest
  and greatest) and uploaded to sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO
  weekly if there were changes. WWW users can access the document at URL
  ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Commercial-HOWTO.html.

  There is a french version of sections 1, 2 and 3 available via WWW
  (ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Commercial-HOWTO.French.html).

  The Commercial-HOWTO is not a forum for product announcements or
  marketing hypes but a service to customers primarily. Two main goals
  are being aimed at:

  1. It shall help companies who want to run Linux to find software
  solutions and applications. The international distribution of this
  list will enhance the contact opportunity.

  2. It is meant to prove the commercial useability of Linux and thus to
  encourage other vendors to port their software as well.

  Companies and developers who are offering their products for Linux and
  interested in joining the Commercial-HOWTO are invited to fill in the
  following form and contact me via e-mail (hm@ix.de, preferred) or fax
  (+49 (0)511/5352-378).  If you happen to know a company which does,
  please drop me a note. If you send me an entry for your product(s),
  please don't forget to send me timely updates if appropriate.







  2.  Disclaimer

  I will not select nor deselect any particular product. Instead,
  everyone who wants to have his/her product included will be serviced.
  However, I reserve the right to shorten individual entries to keep
  things concise.

  If you don't find a particular product or vendor in this list, this is
  probably due to one of the following reasons:

  o  I never heard of that product or vendor and thus didn't try to get
     in contact.

  o  I did get in contact, but the vendor didn't answer yet.

  o  I did get in contact, but the vendor stated positively that he
     doesn't sell his product for Linux (yet).

  In any case, please kick me if you feel someone's missing, also if you
  discover any errors in the file.  But don't forget: I'm not being paid
  for that job ;-) .

  Sometimes two vendor's addresses are mentioned in the "Vendor:" field.
  In these cases I received the information from the German subsidiary /
  distributor.  The original manufacturer's address is always mentioned
  first.






  3.  Related Information

  There's another html page which covers commercial Linux software too.
  It is provided by LINUX.ORG.UK
  (http://www.linux.org.uk/LxCommercial.html) and maintained by Alan Cox
  (Alan.Cox@linux.org).



  4.  Marketing aspects of commercial Linux applications

  This section was suggested by Orest Zborowski (orestz@eskimo.com) and
  is still under construction. It is meant to help potential commercial
  software developers to market their products. There are several
  caveats to watch when doing this, e.g. the GNU Public License
  (ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/Linux/COPYING-2.0). I'd appreciate anyone who
  wants to share his/her experience with Linux-specific marketing issues
  to send me some lines. Please make sure that people interested in more
  specific items can contact you via e-mail or fax.

  5.1.5.  Veritas



     Description:
        Veritas is a system for German drinks wholesalers
        ("Getraenkegrosshaendler"). It's based on Onyx which is my 4gl
        and database project, which of course stays under the GNU Public
        License 2.0 (ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/Linux/COPYING-2.0). Ftp to
        wowbagger.pc-labor.uni-bremen.de (ftp://wowbagger.pc-labor.uni-
        bremen.de/pub/unix/databases) if you like to take a look at
        Onyx.

        The first version of Veritas was developed for PCOS Olivetti in
        1992, later Xenix versions followed. The recent 3rd release
        features twelve years of experience with this kind of market, so
        you can expect to have nearly anything a drinks wholesaler
        needs, e.g. Pfand, Sektsteuer, Brauereiabrechung,
        Bruchverguetung, etc.

        Several servers can be linked via SLIP or UUCP and replicate
        transactions to share data. Clients are connected via ethernet
        to a local server and can run MS Windows or better Linux.


     Distribution Media:
        Directly installed on the customer's hardware. Plus a Tape
        containing (I hope) all of the GNU'ish sources including Onyx
        and a bunch of different databases.


     Licensing Policy:
        Veritas is licensed according to a German translation of the GNU
        Public License 2.0 (ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/Linux/COPYING-2.0),
        restricted in a way that any changes made must be mailed to the
        author, and that any customer must know that I'm the author and
        give support.

        Although the licence is very much like the GPL, I really
        recommend to purchase a copy if you prefer to get support.


     OS Provisions:
        Linux 1.0.9 (MCC), XFree86 2.1.  Servers: 8-16 MB RAM, 200-500
        MB harddisk, tape, modem.  Clients: 8 MB RAM, 40 MB harddisk.


     Documentation:
        About 41 pages printed for Veritas in German, and about 43 pages
        online documentation for Onyx in English.


     Product Support:
        Retail price includes one week of training, and one year first
        class support over modem lines and D2 phone directly from the
        author. If you are interested in Onyx support, contact the
        author directly.


     Linux Support:
        Support for the installed sites is included in the installation
        price for one year.


     Extra Features and Add-Ons:
        N/A


     Available Since:
        The 3rd version of veritas is now in BETA in Bremerhaven.


     Countries with Distribution:
        Only distributed in Germany because of the user interface
        language and a lot of German tax related features.

        If sold outside the northern part of Germany we need a VAR able
        to handle Linux, and sell and install the right hardware for a
        share.


     Price Range:
        Between 10,000 and 20,000 DM without hardware which depends on
        the number of servers and additional tayloring.

     Description:
        Aladdin Ghostscript 3.n is a full PostScript Level 2 language
        interpreter.  It can display PostScript files on the screen with
        X Windows, convert them to various raster formats (TIFF/F, GIF,
        PCX, PPM), and print them on many non-PostScript printers, such
        as the H-P inkjet and laser printers.


     Distribution Media:
        PC diskettes only, normally compressed with tar + gzip. A
        shareware version is available via ftp
        (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/ghost/aladdin) for non-commercial use
        only.


     Licensing Policy:
        Redistribution in non-commercial contexts (i.e., if no money
        changes hands in connection with the distribution) is allowed
        without license.  Any commercial distribution of any kind
        requires a commercial license, with a negotiated license fee.
        If you are a commercial organization and intend to distribute
        Aladdin Ghostscript in a manner for which you believe you don't
        need a license, please check with us: "in connection with" is
        only a shorthand for the terms of the actual non-commercial
        license.


     OS Provisions:
        Will run on any Linux version.  Will display on any X11R4 or R5
