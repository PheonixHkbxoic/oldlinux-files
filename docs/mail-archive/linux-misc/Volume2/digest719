They coldn't do any real harm under Un*x, I guess, but they could

Oh no, what about the HP 8GB DAT drives. These are really just *2GB* drives
so with normal data 4GB would be good going, and 8GB only if you back up
the contents of /dev/zero. I'm surprised tape streamers haven't gone like
hardisk and started using metric MB, as in 1E6 bytes or 1024E3 bytes.

Not necessarily.  Here is a quote from the comp.periphs.scsi FAQ:

        In a typical single drive PC system, ATA (you call it IDE, the
        proper name is ATA) is faster than any SCSI.  This is because of
        the 1 to 2 millisecond command overhead of a SCSI host adapter
        vs. the 100 to 300 microsecond command overhead of an ATA drive.
        Also, ATA transfers data 16-bits at a time from the drive
        directly to/from the system bus.  Compare this to SCSI which
        transfers data 8-bits at a time between the host adapter and the
        drive.  The host adapter may be able to transfer data 16-bits at
        a time to the system bus.

        Of course you could go to Fast SCSI or Wide SCSI but that costs
        a whole bunch more!

I have been reading this thread with great interest; first, I became (as did 
many others) concerned about the possibility that code was distributed with 
ill intent (even though I am not presently a user of the shadow-mk package); 
later, I was simply curious as to the resolution of this.

Let me just say something LOUD AND CLEAR: I do *NOT* believe that you have any 
reason to apologize to anyone. There was a sad misunderstanding here; with the 
ever-present threat of viruses, trojan horses, and what not, people have a 
good reason to be concerned; but all YOU did was provide the result of your 
labors for all of us to use and enjoy, for which the least that you deserve is 
our thanks. There is absolutely no reason for you to feel guilty when you have 
contributed good code to the public domain.

I do not believe that the original poster has any reason to feel guilty 
either. He did the right thing; posted a warning to all of us when there was 
reason to believe that code with ill-intent was circulating and executing 
regularly on our machines with root privileges. Unfortunately, no matter how 
tactful you are, this is something that's very difficult to do without 
implicating the author of the code in question.

So anyways, all I meant to say (since it appears nobody else said it) is that 
you should both be thanked by the rest of us.

a local candidate would be preferable, individual in other location would be
considered. Estimated project duration is 30-60 days, and estimated timeframe

Here are the results of my investigation:  

The incorrect permissions on /bin/_login were due to a mixup when
updating the shadow-mk package's Makefile to correspond to the 
Makefile from the other shadow release.  

** The 4755 perms do not appear present a security risk, however. **

The original /bin/login will deny any logged in user from using
the -f (username) option if they lack sufficient privledge.  Period.
Indeed, the only reason -froot was a problem was that /bin/login
determined that the "active user" calling /bin/login was indeed root
and therefore had permission to use the -f switch.  Any user, once
logged in, cannot use the -f option unless that user is indeed root.

For those persons interested in verifying this statement, log in
as a regular user and type "/bin/login -f root" or "/bin/login -froot"
and see what happens.  You'll not become root.  The problem was in
rlogin and console logins, where /bin/login was being invoked by
root itself, rather than being invoked as suid-root.  Apparently, the 
old /bin/login uses getuid() instead of geteuid() to determine the 
real user id of the user executing the program.

I have had report of this, but because it didn't fail on the 1.1.18 system
I was using, I didn't spot it. (It also makes it hard to debug.) As a work-
around, change the entry in the Imakefile for NO_OPTIMIZE to either "-g" or
just empty, remake your Makefile, rm wpaint.o and rebuild. What ever the
bug is, turning on the optimizer seems to tickle it.

P.S. If anyone can tell me why the font used for the panel choice buttons is too big
(but only on Linux, not the the Sun systems), I'd be eternally grateful.

Call me a radical but, why not just have a routine that uses argv[0]

[rest deleted]

Not too long ago (probably still available at sites with longer expire dates 
on news) there was an extended discussion in comp.os.linux.whatever about 
this. The bottom line is that Linux uses memory _very_ efficiently; basically, 
instead of letting expensive memory lying around unused, it uses it for 
dynamic buffering. This in no way affects the amount of memory available to 
applications.

Therefore, there is no need to 'fix' anything; this is probably the most 
efficient way to use that memory you probably paid many hundreds of $$$ for.

It is NOT the fact that few people had compilers on their system, but the
