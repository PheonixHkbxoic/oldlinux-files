Actually, almost every study I have ever seen shows that WYSIWYG significantly
reduces the productivity of a person trying to get serious writing done. I
believe that these were studies of documentation producers and that they found
that users of WYSIWYG spend a lot of time formatting and reformatting to get
visual appearance when they should be writing content. In other words, the
process of wrting content then formatting is more productive that formatting as
you go and WYSIWYG tends to lead people to format as they go.

I guess that we are not talking letters and memos here, but reports, books,
etc. and this makes a difference. But the bottom line is, no body has ever
shown me anything that proves WYSIWYG makes for more productive writing...

I also have to admit that I generally use WYSIWYG...

I think some people are missing the point about SGIs.  First, a little about
myself.  I run a lab of 7 SGIs and a linux box (more to come, probably).

Linux is great for UNIX and X.  SGIs, OTOH, have a *lot* of custom
hardware for doing 3D calcs very fast.  They havn't had a *really* fast 
CPU in the past (the R8000, of course, is different), but they have
had very good SMP (in the challenge and onyx series) and extraordinary
3D graphics (look at the specs for a Reality Engine 2 sometime).

So, this is somewhat like the "Mac vs. PC" crusades that are always going on.

Each machine has it's strong points, and each is the "best solution" for
some people.

BTW, I would like to see a PC that beats an R8000 (110 SpecINT and 330 SpecFP
at a measly 75 MHz... better than the new DEC which is 300 SpecINT and
500 SpecFP, but at 300 MHz), but that's another story.

 Really? This must be in your own field, because some journals of the

only kerning pairs, but everything in my documents, because I know that
the way I see them is the way the final reader will see them. BTW, the
e-mail process is far faster than the usual method of submission; even
if the only advantage of LaTeX were this, I'll take it over that myriad
of brain dead 'clicky' Windows word processors.

 Another important thing: I'm by no means a typist, nor want to be one.
Why on earth should I care of the intrincate problems of document
typesetting when a program can do it for me?

 I won't claim that LaTeX is a good multilingual processor, but my master
thesis was written on it, in spanish, without troubles. Sure, Hebrew, Kanji
and lots of other languages are not there, but at least it's a step forward.

 BTW, I use vi as the editor for my LaTeX documents, so I'm probably brain

I think Po-Han misunderstood what 'monolithic' means.  He referred
to monolithic as meaning controlled, whereas monolithic - as opposed
to microkernel - is really a description of the OS design.
Both BSD and Linux are monolithic in this respect.  

In any case, one has to qualify what is mean by "controlled".
Many say that BSD is tightly controlled by the BSD core team,
whereas Linux is developed through a loose, uncentralised,
group of programmers.

My understanding is that anyone can contribute to BSD as well,
so that the real difference is that whereas a team decides
what goes into BSD, only one person decides what goes into
Linux (namely, Linus).  Big deal.

The intent of the book is to help you get TeX (and its myriad programs) up and

how to use TeX et al.

That's why its title "Making TeX Work" not 'How to Use TeX'.

        What the DOS user REALLY needs for using LINUX....

        GOOD DOCUMENTATION that relates common DOS commands to UNIX commands.

        The "problem" is with the complexity and unfamiliarity of the 
UNIX commands. I think that a good documentation project (hello LDP 
members!) for UNIX commands, indexed by their DOS siblings, as well as a 
section for all those "crazy little things" DOS just doesn't offer, like 
a section on "If you are on 'the NET'..." - people who are using LINUX at 
home have no need, unless they have access to a dialup, to have IRC and 
TELNET and all that stuff cluttering their little minds.
        There should definitely be a section on multiuser - like how to 
change passwords, permissions, ownership, how to read "drwxr-xr-x", etc.

        I would actually like to have a printout of a complete listing 
like this next to my Linux Box :-)

The ATI GUP with 2mb VRAM I have performs just fine, using a dotclock of 135Mhz
it displays 1280x1024 resolution 256 colors at refreshrate 74Hz.
Be sure to get the Pro version with VRAM instead of DRAM, otherwise the memory
can't cope with the speed resulting in 'snow' when moving windows around.

Wrong.  As I just said, the GUP has a 135Mhz pixel clock.  It also takes more
than 135 to drive 1280x1024 @80hz...at least in all cases I am aware of.

Really?  Did the keyboard suddenly magically start generating the Alt-Shift->
sequence that it couldn't generate for the whole time I had it?

Has Marvin Wu actually tried to use it as strenuously as I used it while I had
it?  Has he used it to do compute-intensive things for prolonged periods of
time in a 72-degree room?  That's what I was doing with it, and that's the
environment in which it was failing (I did, incidentally, ask Wu if the room
was too hot for the machine, and he said that it wasn't).  I seriously doubt
that he has done this kind of testing on the machine.

Wu extended the warrantee because the machine never worked properly and I told
him that if he didn't extend the warrantee, I was going to ship the machine
back immediately because I was not satisfied.  He had the option of choosing
to extend the warrantee or have me return the machine, and he chose the
former.  That's his problem, not mine.

As I told you in E-mail, it is not necessary to experience good service in
order to know when one is experiencing bad service.

I've had a number of people contact me and tell me they had similar problems
with SWT (including someone else who got a machine that didn't work, spent
months installing replacement parts from SWT to try to get it to work, and
then finally returned it, only to have the refund check bounce just like mine
did!).  I've read first-hand accounts from a number of people who bought
Pentium systems from other vendors who were extraordinarily pleased with the
service they received and who had no hardware problems with the systems at
all, for a long time after they purchased them.  That is as it should be. 
When a vendor ships a machine, the machine should work.  If it doesn't, the
vendor has done something wrong.  If that vendor ships machines that don't
work with some frequency, then there is something wrong with the vendor.

This accusation is offensive and baseless, notwithstanding the fact that you
prefix it with "might".  I have not bought another machine because I have not
had time.  That's what I told you in E-mail, and I even provided an extensive
explanation of why I have not had time.  Getting married, going on a
honeymoon, moving into a new apartment, missing almost two work weeks (all of
which had to be made up) for Jewish holidays, and working sixty- and
seventy-hour work weeks can eliminate most of a person's free time, you know. 
If anyone seriously believes that I returned the machine to SWT because I
decided I "didn't really need or couldn't afford a new workstation," I will be
glad to provide any number of character references -- people who know that I
would never do what is being suggested, and people who know that I had
continuous problems with the machine for three months and finally returned it
only as a last resort.

He may have made an effort, honest or otherwise, but he never succeeded.  My
machine never worked.

Bob, are you speaking from the point of view of a satisfied customer of SWT or
something more?  Are you and Wu acquaintenaces, perhaps, or even friends?  You
did tell me in E-mail that you are "on reasonably good terms with Marvin Wu." 
What exactly does that mean?

        Oh... I dunno... my 74 year-old Dad seems to be pretty happy with
        his Linux system... his only gripe is that there don't seem to be
        any uucp sites to connect to in the Ft. Myers, FL area!

: Yeah, but could the 8088 in 1981 run UNIX? Probably--Microsoft did buy 
: Xenix. But Lotus 123 was written for DOS, which was what probably 
: solidified MS-DOS as _the_ major OS for Intel boxes.

        I kinda thought that the IBM PC did that by legitimising a 
        hitherto fragmented market.   And wasn't Lotus 123 stolen ..errr..
        "borrowed as in look-and-feel" from Visicalc?  I can't remember
        exactly... old-timer's disease, you know... :)

: I personally think that there's place in the computing world both for

: different audiences, with only a little overlap.

        Actually, I agree with you here... I've given up trying to 
        convert the world to Linux.  If they're happy with DOS and
        Windows (and the wonderful stability they have <g>), leave them
        be.  Use something like samba and connect to a Linux server
        for file sharing and such, but leave them happy and in the
        same state of mastery/confusion as they've come to love.

        Just my .0000005 cents worth.
