Does anybody know where I can get information about how to set up our DNS 
to have a second hostname, but pointing to the same machine?

I'd like to set our info serer up so that if anyone on the 'Net wanted to 
access our gopher, then all they would need to enter is
'gopher gopher.rsa.lib.il.us' instead of 'gopher darkstar.rsa.lib.il.us'.

Please e-mail suggestions or post here.  I'll be watching (lurking).

Thanks! :)

Actually, the current version of WordPerfect for Unix does ship with
a text based version (as well as the X based WYSIWYG).  There is no compromise;
choose which version you need, or run both.  (Inotherwords, you don't have
to go to an early version of WP to get that functionality).  MS-"Word" is
a different story.

That is a packaging problem.  As far as I am concerned, Linux distributions
should have IBCS included and install it as an option.

Nahh.... upgrade it to the Unix version :)

Another thing which should be installable from Slackware but is not (at least
in 2.0).  (I know, it's not officially out of Beta, but neither is IBCS and
that seems to run as solid as a rock)

So MS-DOS comes packaged with a word processor?  What about commercial
Unixes?  OS/2?  I don't think that last line makes much sense.  You have
to "add" something to any OS to get a word processor; even if it is just
the wp software itself.

Indeed we do need a native WP.  Primarily because of cost (free).  WP for
Unix and everything else I have run under Linux's IBCS seems to run just
as fast as native SCO.  I'm not sure I think it is even appropriate to
called the IBCS code an "emulator" anymore....  But it would round things
out to have a free word processor (like WP) for all Unix platforms.

Agreed. This does seem to always fix the problem but is a very messy way

This is the cause on your computer but what about other people. I know 
that many people have the most problems with SLIP but it is definately 
not the only place an error occurs.

This may be the cause on your machine but it certainly is not the problem

in the inetd.

I'm sorry you guys seem to have had trouble with your discs.  I';ve had 
Fall94 instaleld for a month now of development time (nights and 
weekends) and its behaved flawlessly, but maybe we are using different 
things.  Have you checked the erratta sheet? There were a few known link 
problems, but not very many as I recall....

I beleive IRQ 3 is reserved for tty01 under Linux. So you must put your
NE2000 card under IRQ 15 with port 340. I think is one of the best way.
But don't change your Adaptec's configuration because it's a good 
configuration. If you got a problem again then you must read your 
main-card's documentation for fixing the jumpers.

There isn't anything special about compiling NEdit-3.1.
It compiles out of the box with the following entries in the
'Makefile.linux' in the subdirectories ./sources and .util 
of the NEdit source tree:
        CC=gcc
        AR=ar
        CFLAGS= -m486 -O -Dlinux -DMOTIF12
        LIBS= -lXm -lXt -lX11
        include Makefile.common

You see NEdit is a MOTIF application so you need the MOTIF-libs
to compile it!

It's a three-fold problem of packaging, emulation, and purchase. I agree that

I also agree that emulated programs work well under Linux.

But sine Wordprocessing in so fundamental I think there is a real need for

I knew that Mark. In fact I have a copy of SCO WordPerfect 5.1 sitting
on my desk waiting for kernel upgrade and the IBSC2 installation necessary
to install it.

But as you pointed out in another post I'm cheap. After getting used to
free OS's, editors, compilers, and the like why should I pay for a
WordProcessor? Even if it's the same price as the DOS product (which I 
personally don't use anyway.)

There is no one true way. However my preference is not to deal with
DOS/Windows unless it's absolutely necessary. In fact for folks where it's
clear they don't need anything more I endorse using DOS/Windows. However I
oftentimes (and sometimes honestly ;-) play dumb to the "how do you do this
and how do you do that?" questions that invariably come up.

-
-Do we really care about "market share" like Bill Gates?

Not like Bill Gates (9.8 billion bucks. Wow!).
-
-Do we want Linux to be a mass-market product?

Hell yes! I'd love to put Mr. Gates out of business.

Well SVGA raises some possibilities. However as a few of us keep pointing
out that there are a lot of old terminals and 8088/80286/EGA/CGA machines
in use out there.

The real fact is that a mojority of setups that can run SVGALIB can run X
too. So what exactly is the real win of choosing one over the other?

Someone show me a free functional WordProcessor that runs properly on a
vt-320 terminal and I'll promise to shut up about wordprocessors. And while
HWP is a step in the right direction, it's not all there yet.

Later,

It would also be interesting to compare the SPEC numbers with those
obtained by Intel. Does a Pentium really produce twice the integer
performance per MHz compared with a 486? With gcc?

Subject: Stable kernel version opinion?
Date: 14 Oct 1994 02:12:57 -0400

We are putting the finishing touches on our CD-ROM distribution
and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the stability
of some of the more recent kernels.

Our install procedure allows you to use multiple kernel versions,
and right now we have 1.0.9 and 1.1.18.  Version 1.1.53 has been
a little bit troublesome and may not make the cut.  What version
do you think is the latest, most stable release?

Thanks for your opinions,
Marc
