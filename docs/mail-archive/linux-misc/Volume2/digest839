Of course, you'll have to include xpm so you can have all sorts of colorful 
pixmaps.  Also a dynamic utility to convert .ico's to .xpm's would help.
        Soundrec should be easy to find a replacement for.
        Mediaplay could be replaced by xanim
        Paintbrush by xpaint
        calender by some x prog (xcal?)
        Include some stupid incomprehensiable and unused program to replace Object 
                Packer  
        Tons of bitmaps for the background.
        A graphical interface to xkeysym to replace key mapper.
        Through in xsc and they'll think they're getting Lotus for free.

There is no one listening at the other end. Notice that the id number
does not increment. It keeps sending the "hello, I want to talk to
you. Is anyone there?" (LCP-request) frame. This is sent every three
seconds. Unfortnately, there is no one home at the other end.

Your remote end is not running ppp. In fact, it is not doing much of
anything. You need to talk to the snarf.com admin people and get the
proper login script or something.

Your idea is a good one, but I fear that such a HOWTO would be
extremely long. You want to cover everything from shells to 
man pages to editors to kernel compliations. This is essentially
what has been done in the I&GS, which covers these things and more.
You can't condense this information considerably, and if you try
to do so you'll lose the content. What's wrong with the I&GS?

of trying to preempt what we already have.

Duvel's is pretty yummy, although a bit pricey.  Lindeman's Kriek is 
nice too, although I don't think Lambics should be considered beer.
Otherwise, we don't get too much Belgian beer arround here.

If you can settle for beers from other nationalities, I'd have to 
recommend Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout and Taddy Porter, McEwan's 
Scotch Ale, New Castle Brown Ale, and Sam Adams Cream Stout.

There are also plenty of local microbreweries in the states which
have very tasty beers, with personal favorites being cask conditioned like 
the Walnut Brewery's Cask Conditioned James and Wilderness Pub's Cask 
Conditioned Stout. Other local favorites are Colorado Kind Ale from 
the Mountain Sun Pub and Brewery (very hoppy), Extra Special Bitter,
etc.

For light beers, I'd have to go with Sierra Nevada Pale,
the Walnut Brewery's Buffalo Gold Ale, or Breckenridge Brewery's
India Pale Ale.

You are right about graphics rendering hardware. It costs also certainly 
more then any PC video card. Unfortunately it is highly specific to the
3-D polygon manipulations and has very moderate speedup for X applications.
I measured 85 KXstones on my Indigo R-4000 with XZ videocard ($3000 option).
You can get comparable X performance with ~$100 worth S3 videocard under
XFree.
        3-D GL libraries is also freely available for Linux and they are
almost compatible with Silicon Graphics GL format.

Of course I set -mips2 option while compiling. I don't have SGI with R4600
available to test it, but according to the specs it is slower then P5-90. R4400 is
faster but it costs much more then P5-90.

The original Ultralite Versa uses a Chips and Technologies chipset.
XFree86 doesn't support that chipset, so the only server that works is
the generic VGA16 server.  It is extremely slow and you run out of
colours real fast.

The Versa E's have a Western Digital chipset which is supported and
works _very_ nicely in 256 colour mode.  It can also drive an external
monitor at 1024x768 in 256 colours which is nice too.  :)

Don't know about the Versa 'S' models.

I can buy 10 Peniums for that money and organize Parallel Virtual

The first sentence is correct; the remainder are misinformation at best.
IBM's SLC and DLC processors are indeed merely improved 386s; however, the
BlueLightenings are true 486-class processors; they use the 486 architecture

  Well, even workstation owners occasionally go and get bids from
other suppliers when the workstation vendor charges too much for
add-in components.  Buying an ethernet card from Dell for $450 is
like buying extra winchesters from SGI without bothering to look
at the third-party vendors.
