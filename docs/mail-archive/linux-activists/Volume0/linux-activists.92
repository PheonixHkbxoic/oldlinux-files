In order to use shoelace under linux, someone will have to compile
laceup.c.  If someone does this, I will post the other components
that have been compiled under minix.  A more reasonable method
would be to just adapt that portion that selects the menu of 
which partition to boot, and make that part of the linux 
distribution.

This is particularly so since, linux and minix treat device number/names
differently.  

Integrating the boot code is important because linux will be 
going to a differnt file system (bigger) than minix, which will
use 32 bit inode pointers instead of 16 bit ones.

Gcc 2.0 is imminient. Some one in our CS department is playing with a beta 
version, and although I'm unsure of the release date, it may be installed
before next semester.  Gcc and g++ also become one product in 2.0.  

Save the trouble of porting another gcc in the future, and do it when 2.0 
is available.  Then send in diffs to the config files to the gnu people, 
any conditionaly compiled code in any source files (should be 
unecessary) and have it part of the standard gcc distribution.

Thanks to John Schutz for finding the bootsect.s ommission.
Move bootsect.s to bootsect.S and apply the following patch.
Its purpose is to avoid defining the same constants in two
different places.

I've also been fooling around a bit with a beta version of gcc-2.0 -
that's the reason I wanted to have some kind of 387-emulation in 0.12. 
I can happily report that cc1 compiles without changes, but the version
I compiled sometimes aborts without any error message (not due to linux:
it does the same thing on a Sun).  In any case it seems that with the
387 emulation in place, gcc-2.0 shouldn't need any difficult porting: it
compiled at once after "./configure --gas i386-gas-sysv", and after I
removed a "-lPW" and a "-g" from the Makefile. 

This all leads up to the sad thing: gcc-2.0 is /a lot/ bigger than 1.40:
the binary is about 800kB for cc1 alone, and with all the C++ files, I
won't be able to port the whole thing after all, due to lack of disk
space.  I gave it one whole 20M partition, and wasn't able to compile
more than the C-part before it ran out of space.  I'd guess you'll need
at least 25M free to get everything compiled.  That's why I have been
working on the 387-emu: at least whoever ports gcc-2.0 won't have to
trouble with the floating-point patches.

It's possible that I missed this in the patches somewhere, but the
following needs to be added to your include/linux/config.h file:

#define DEF_INITSEG 0x9000	
#define DEF_SYSSEG 0x1000
#define DEF_SETUPSEG 0x9020
#define DEF_SYSSIZE 0x3000

I would have liked to make a diff file, but since I'm a complete loser
who doesn't know how to use diff, I didn't.

Now you know why I am posting this before sending it to Linus.
Perhaps I should explain.  Disk space for me is extremely tight,
and I do not have enough to do a test patch before posting.
I have to do incredible contortions just to get this done.

Subject: Final version of the job control patches....
Date: Thu, 2 Jan 92 19:00:19 -0500
From: tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU (Theodore Ts'o)
To: Linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi
Reply-To: tytso@athena.mit.edu

The final copy of my job control patches to Linux 0.11 have been sent to
Linus; if you want an early peek at them, look in
tsx-11.mit.edu:/ALPHA/jobcontrol.  The following is the NOTES file from
that directory:

New Features added by these patches

	* Job control (setpgrp(), tcsetpgrp(), signals, wait(), etc.)
	* gethostname(), sethostname()
		- try using the included hostname program!
	* getrusage()
		- not completely implemented, but the skeleton
			is in place.
	* getrlimit(), setrlimit()  
		- try using the ulimit command in bash!
		- nothing looks at the limits yet, though
	* gettimeofday(), settimeofday()
		- for that microsecond accuracy some people demand :-)
			(well, 0.01 second accuracy, actually....)

Notes about patches:

1) I integrated in John Kohl's patches to tty_io.c, since I had also
	made changes, and at least one of his patches depended on
	my patch being made first.  I have included the other patches
	which he sent to me as separate patches in separate files,
	in case you did not get a copy from him.

2)  I changed the name of system_call.s to sys_call.s, since system_call.s
	is too long for RCS and !@#$! 14 character filenames.  You
	should either also make this change (and modify the Makefile
	appropriately) or edit the patch file to change the filename
	back to system_call.s

3)  Currently, MAXHOSTNAMELEN is set at 8 characters.  I think it
	should be changed to 64 characters (change in sys/param.h),
	to make it like BSD.  Unfortunately, doing this will require 
	recompiling libc.a and the shell, since it uses the uname() 
	system call.  Not a big deal, but it means that when you boot
	with the new kernel, you need to make sure you have the right
	version of /bin/sh installed.

4)  When we add time zone support into the library, we will need to
	do something about how Linux sets the time from the CMOS
	registers.   The problem is that the CMOS clock ticks localtime,
	and POSIX specifies that we should be ticking GMT time. 
	Currently, we're not, so it's not a problem; but once we
	start including TZ routines in the libc, we will need to deal
	with it.  My attempt to solve the problem can be found in
	sys.c: adjust_time().  I don't like the solution all that much,
	but it's the best I could think of at the time.

Things to think about:

A)  Perhaps the task_struct should go in malloc()'ed memory.  This
	will free close to 1k for the kernel stack.  We may not need
	to do it now, but as more things get added to the task_struct
	(like BSD-style group lists, etc.), and as the kernel gets more
	complicated (for example, when networking code is added),
	I suspect we will need to do it sooner or later.


B)  Speaking of which, I haven't looked at the new VM stuff that does
	paging.  Does the malloc() routine still work, or will it 
	need to be modified to coexist with paging?

C)  Another good idea would be to unify the buffer management and
	the free pool memory management, ala SunOS and the latest
	Sys VR4 design.  This allows free memory pages to be used as 
	buffers and vice versa.

D)  Currently, gid_t is a unsigned char.  I would strongly suggest that
	we change to be a unsigned short, and represent it internally
	in the kernel as an unsigned int.  This will make life much
	easier if (ha, ha) we ever decide add the Andrew Filesystem 
	(AFS) to Linux.  Since this effects the stat structure, this
	will probably require recompiling large numbers of programs.

E)  If a Linux machine stays up for greater than 248 days, the number of
 	clock ticks will become > 2**31, and jiffies will overflow.  I 
	suspect something really messy will happen then.  We can make
	things better by making jiffies (and all places that refer to
	offsets off jiffies) unsigned longs instead of signed longs,
	but even so, it is still conceivable for a machine to be
	up for greater than 500 days.

	This isn't a problem now, since Linux is in beta test, but
	saying that Unix systems are too unstable to worry about what
	happens when they've been up for more than 500 days seems
	a bit wrong to me.

Here is a quick hack to get shoelace to work under native
Linux.  All that required was coaxing laceup to compile.
The catch was, no minix header files could be used.

All the executables are provided, so there is nothing to
compile.  I provided laceup.c only in case some adventurous
soul wishes to try adapting shoelace properly someday so that
large file systems could be supported.

Please note.  I have only tested this with my floppy drive,
so be wary..

Just follow the readme file provided, and you should be fine.

Subject: mkfs -c
Date: Thu, 2 Jan 1992 19:51:55 -0700
From: Drew Eckhardt <drew@hazelrah.cs.Colorado.EDU>
To: drew@hazelrah.cs.Colorado.EDU, linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi,

I initally had Linux on the second, smaller partition on my drive.
It was error free, and I had no problem doing a mkfs on it. 

However, I have another, 32M partition I'd like to sacrifice to Linux, and it 
does have errors on it.  However, when I do a mkfs -c, the parameters
come up, the drive light blinks for a while, and then it just hangs there - 
no disk activity light, nothing.    

I can cntrl-C out of mkfs, but after it's died, I don't get a prompt back again.
There is NO furthur output from mkfs.

Pertinient information :
Software
Linux .11, as distributed with minor boot sector patches.

Hardware 
386-33, Elite chipset, 4M ram  
Western Digital WD1006-MM1 - very WD1003 compatable
	Microscience 1050 (1024 X 5 heads, MFM)

Seagate ST-02 		(currently ignored)
	Seagate 296N

the problem is always reproducable, occurs irregardless of what's mounted 
as the root file system, and any disk accesses performed before the mkfs.

Any ideas?  mkfs source or a newer working binary? 

Some one needs to get gdb up and running.  Any takers?

Looking furthur, I find that when the -c flag was specified, only 1000 blocks 
were created.  It's getting stuck there...

Subject: shoelace for linux
Date: Thu, 2 Jan 92 23:02:03 PST
From: pmacdona@sol.UVic.CA (Peter MacDonald)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

If you didn't get my last message re: shoelace for linux,
you are probably one of the ones whose mailer cheerfully
bounced the message because it was two large.  So instead,
I have uploaded shoelace.tar.Z to incoming on nic.funet.fi
Below I repeat the message...





--------------------------------------------------------

Here is a quick hack to get shoelace to work under native
Linux.  All that required was coaxing laceup to compile.
The catch was, no minix header files could be used.

All the executables are provided, so there is nothing to
compile.  I provided laceup.c only in case some adventurous
soul wishes to try adapting shoelace properly someday so that
large file systems could be supported.

Please note.  I have only tested this with my floppy drive,
so be wary..

Just follow the readme file provided, and you should be fine.

Hi Y'all;
         here are the lp files. they aren't much right now but they will make
 the printer go. (that reminds me- put a line in your init code somewhere that
calls void lp_init( void ). i forgot to put the file in the archive. oops)
         right now i am working on the following (mis-) features :-)
         o  ioctl - to handle error recovery, translation, reset, etc.
         o  lpd   - basic queue services
         in that order.
         and now for a few stupid questions:
         what does the GNU getgroups() do? i wanted to compile cp(1) but make
barfed on this- not found.
         is the message passing stuff going to be in the pipeline somewhere? i
am asking this because i need some sort of system log for the lpd.
         what does POSIX say about printers & does anyone care?
         thanks for the airtime. jim[v5068u].vm.temple.edu

    what does the GNU getgroups() do? i wanted to compile cp(1) but make
    barfed on this- not found.

getgroups() is an optional POSIX system call, derived from BSD systems:

	int ngroups = getgroups(int gidsetlen, gid_t *gidset)

(this is the POSIX definition.  BSD systems have the type of gidset as
int, which is not the same as gid_t (unsigned short in BSD, and unsigned
char in Linux) --- this can be confusing)

This is used to support the feature where a user can be a member of more
than one group simultaneously.  At login-time, login(1) uses the
setgroups() call to establish a list of groups that the user is in, and
this list is inherited by all child processes.  When a groups-level
permission check is done, if any of the groups in the groups list match
the group of the file, then the user is given group access.  The
getgroups() call is a way that the process can inquire about its group
list.  

If cp(1) from the GNU fileutils is trying to use getgroups(), it sounds
like there's some sort of mis-configuration going on.  Its .h files must
somehow think that it's being compiled on a BSD-like system.  It sounds
like either something in the /usr/include .h files is tricking it to
believe that the getgroups() call exists on your system, or you need to
frob some #define's in the configuration header file of the fileutils
package.  In general, I've found that programs which are told that it's
compiling on SysV R2 or R3 machine generally work.

Alternatively, someone could try adding setgroups()/getgroups() to
Linux --- this would be a good thing, since the BSD way is much easier
to use when you belong to multiple groups.

   Some one needs to get gdb up and running.  Any takers? 

Some one needs to get core dumps and/or ptrace() working first.  :-)

The job control patches have a hook for the core dump routine, but it
hasn't been implemented yet.  (I wanted to wait until after the VFS
stuff settles out.)  

Another thing which would be really nice to get working would be
profiling --- both user-level and possibly kernel-level profiling would
be nice.  Also, assuming you have a swap partition, it would be nice to
change linux to do crash dumps after it panics.  In short, it looks like
there will be plenty of hacking for people to do after Linux 0.12 comes
out.  :-)

Yes, I've had it happen once, and I haven't been able to reproduce it
since.

Interestingly enough, only once of my serial ports wedged, so I just
dealt with the problem by switching my modem to the other port and
continued work on /dev/tty2.  A reboot later on did clear the problem.
The next time it happens, I'm going to try reading out the serial
registers using /dev/port to see if there any clues to be found there.

I have also had this happen every so often.  Soft boots haven't
cleared it, even when I reboot into MessyDOS, and use a comm program
there, then reboot to Linux.  The only thing that seems to clear it is
power cycle or reset.  While it has happened a few times, I have not
been able to figure out any conditions that lead up to it <sigh>...

If the serial ports sometimes hang after booting linux, it is probably due
to inadequate initialization. See the Minix-1.6.16 rs232.c (i.e., my rs232.c)
for (almost?) correct initialization.

If they hang after heavy use, it is more likely one of the xx50 bugs. E.g.,
the interrupt ID reg sometimes reports no interrupt when there is an
interrupt. It's necessary to check the modem status bits and possibly the
line status bits directly before leaving the interrupt handler. Someone
says that these bits sometimes lie too and it helps to disable and enable
modem status and output interrupts a lot.

To handle this mess, fileutils-1.5 (which implements cp) has

#ifdef POSIX
#if !defined(sun) && !defined(ultrix)
#define GID_T gid_t
#else
#define GID_T int
#endif
#else
#define GID_T int
#endif

and it assumes (GID_T *) in the prototype. I think another gnu utilities
package uses GETGROUPS_T to allow for gid_t being different.

>...It sounds

NGROUPS_MAX.

>Alternatively, someone could try adding setgroups()/getgroups() to

Minix has { return 0; } for getgroups. This is good enough for fileutils
to work.

Subject: nonblock read;  ptys;
Date: Sat, 4 Jan 92 10:07:08 PST
From: pmacdona@sanjuan.UVic.CA (Peter MacDonald)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

I also found the tty_read command to be blocking when VMIN=0.  Now some 
questions about the solution seen in the job control patches. Which is:

  if (!time && !minimum && !L_CANON(tty)
    nr = MIN(nr,CHARS(tty->secondary);

Now for the questions:

  - Should open with O_NONBLOCK implemented  by setting VMIN=0 and !L_CANON?
  - If so, should the above be changed to just return -EAGAIN?
  - Ditto for fcntrl O_NONBLOCK?

EAGAIN is what nonblocking read is supposed to return in errno
on failed reads.


Next, some pseudo-tty questions:

Ptys are pairs of ttys, the Master and the Slave.  Anything written to the
Master tty, appears on the input of the Slave, and vice versa.
I am implementing the Slave as just a normal tty, but to save
wasted buffer space, I have the Master tty write directly to the
slave read_q and then call copy_to_cooked.  Likewise, the Master 
reads come directly from the the Slaves write_q.  This not only 
saves space, but also unecessary shuffling of data to and from 
queues.  

Is this approach sound?  Aren't there concurrency problems with
two processes manipulating the same queue at the same time?  Don't
the serial and tty handlers have the same problem, cause even
though they have interrupts disabled, the tty_read or tty_write
processes could have been right in the middle of changing q.head?

If there are no concurrency problems, then master ptys can just
use tty_read and tty_write, with modifications to point to the 
right queues, and the q->write() pointer called in tty_write
calling a function that invokes copy_to_cooked.  

If there are concurrency problems, 
would tty_write have to call a seperate pty_write function
which would (shudder) cli() and sti() around writing across queues?
This would result in more code to maintain in future.

Subject: A screen dumper for VC
Date: Sat, 4 Jan 92 14:55:02 PST
From: pmacdona@sanjuan.UVic.CA (Peter MacDonald)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

Someone, somewhere said "when you have virtual consoles, you almost
don't need a windowing system, except for cutting and pasting, of
course".  Well cut and paste is hard to do without a windowing system
and mouse, but dumping the contents of the screen isn't to hard.  

One to many times I watched my modem go "NO CARRIER" in the middle
of a mail message I was composing, leaving me staring at the contents
of a screen I knew I would have to completely retype.  So I implemented..


  setterm -dump n -file dumpscreenfile

or just 

  setterm -dump

These options to the setterm command cause the screen to be dumped
to a file.  If a console number n is specified, the contents of that
console are dumped, otherwise the current console is dumped.  

If a file is not specified with the -file dumpscreenfile option, 
then the contents of the screen go to the file screen.dump in the 
current directory.
 

Technical Note:

  To avoid adding another system call, I defined TIOCSNAP in termios.h
  and used ioctl to do the dumping for me.  

  The SCR_COLS and SCR_ROWS should be defined in <linux/config.h>.
  Instead, I currently just check if VIDEO_VGA_50_LINES is defined,
  else use 25 lines.

Hello Activists:


I seem to be having a problem figuring-out Disk Partitions.  I have
an IDE drive, with MSDOS 5.0, and two questions.


Question #1:
When I use DOS's FDISK, I can only make a maximum of two partitions,
the Primary Partition, and the Extended partition.  Now, since DOS
wants the Primary Partition for itself, this only leaves the extended
partition, which Linux won't accept.  How do you create a partition
of a kind other than Primary or Extended for Linux?

Question #2:
I see in many places people talking about having four partitions on
one hard drive, but I seem only able to create one Primary, and one
Extended partition.  How are these people creating more than two
partitions?  Are they refering to separate Logical DOS Drives within
one Extended Partition?  In particular I am refering to the file:
INSTALL-0.11, by Linus, under the section titled: "Using it."


Thanks,

I am trying to read the keyboard via int 0x16 from setup.s
this seems to work until Linux have booted then the keyboard
is hanged. But if I for example press ctrl+c after I have done
the keyboard read the keyboard is not hanged when Linux starts.
Anybody have any ideas of why and how to avoid ?
This may be uninteresting to most so please answer to me directly.

As I mailed earlier int 0x16 seems to hang the keyboard for Linux when
used in setup.s. I guess the keyboard must be reset or something before
starting Linux (after the int 0x16). I said something about when pressing
ctrl+c afterwards seems to "undo" the hanging this was not true (it was 
just as it looked) In fact it seems to hang at random (with possibility 
going towards 1 :-( ) If anybody knows how to reset/or anything the keyboard
outport etc. Please let me know ! Or any other ideas of why/how/etc.

The problem is that the fdisk which MS-DOS uses very limited; it only
knows how to deal with MS-DOS partitions (my 8-bit CP/M machines from
ten years ago did better than that!).

The MS-DOS partitioning scheme does indeed allow for having four
partitions on one hard drive.  The problem was that four is just way too
small of a number.  So what MS-DOS did was that MS-DOS knows how to make
two partitions --- the "Primary" DOS parition, and the "Extended
partition", which is in reality one of the four "Primary" partitions
which can be allocated on a hard disk.  This leaves two other partitions
which MS-DOS FDISK doesn't deal with at all.  Other operating systems,
like OS/2 or Linux, can use them, if they can figure out a way to set up
the other two partitions.  I thought you could indeed use the Extended
partition for Linux, but this is sort of a bad idea, since the wrong
MS-DOS commands could easily trash your Linux filesystem.

If you want to set up one the third and fourth "Primary" partitions,
there are two ways to do this.  The first is to use something like
Norton Utilities, and mess with partition tables with a disk editor.
Norton Utilities' disk editor is actually fairly sophisticated, so it
knows the format of the tables.  You still have to do a bit of manual
calculations to get the ector numbering and double-checking, though.

The other method is to use a more sophisticated FDISK command; the one
supplied with OS/2 will work.  I don't know if there are any other PD
versions of FDISK out there that will do the trick.  There is a fdisk
command under Linux, but currently it will only print out the partition
table.  Eventually you should be able to use the fdisk that comes with
Linux; however, for right now, that's why I only recommend Linux to
people who are willing to hack on it.  :-)

Subject: Incorrect path parsing in fs/namei.c.
From: Tom Ivar Helbekkmo <tih@barsoom.nhh.no>
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi (Linux Activists)
Date: Sun, 5 Jan 92 19:26:17 MET

There's a problem in fs/namei.c that affects absolute pathnames.  It
can easily be demonstrated by e.g.:

# cd /etc
# cp rc /

...which gives an error message (can't remember the exact wording) to
the effect that "//rc" can't be opened.  This is caused by the
concatenation of the directory, a '/' and the filename, which gives a
double slash.

Of course, multiple slashes should be allowed.  Not being familiar
with how, exactly, namei parsing should work, I can't offer a fix.
What I did locally, just to minimize the effect, was to check for
another slash near the top of get_dir(), where it recognizes a leading
slash as being the root directory, and just skipping that second slash
if present.

Also, another bug somewhere (race condition in the file system?)
showed up after I installed the virtual consoles patches...  Starting
three shells on three virtual consoles from /etc/rc in direct
succession caused the file system to be damaged.  It turned out that
this was caused by the three instances of bash accessing the
.bash_history file at the same time.  Staggering the shell startups
sufficiently in time fixed it, as did disabling the history file
feature from the .profile file.  At startup, the kernel would report

	trying to free block (NNNN:NNNN), count = N

while starting the shells, where the last N would be sometimes 1,
sometimes 2.  Running fsck on the file system would show that number
of references to the same (actually unallocated) block.  On the good
side, fsck fixed the file system.

A bit of good news: I'm running with the posted shoelace here, and can
report that booting from my hard disk with shoelace works great.  No
more floppies here, except for my emergency boot floppy, of course.

You don't really have to go through BIOS int 16 to read keyboard,
potentially causing problems. You can read it directly, on port 0x60.
A value less than 129 is a "key pressed" signal, with the value bin
the scancode of key pressed. A value more than 128 is "key released"
signal, with the value being scancode+128.

I use the 'edpart' program I picked up from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.
it runs under DOS, and provides an o.k. interface.  I believe it lets
you select partitions on cylinder boundaries, and does the rest of the
calculations itself.
[of course, you have to calculate from blocks/MB to cylinders...]

This is corrected in my version - it will be in 0.12.  I had expressly
forbidden zero-length pathnames, as I didn't know what to do about them,
but tytso implemented the same change as you wanted, and it seems that
is what linux should do.

Right - this is a race-condition in "open()" when using the O_TRUNC
flag.  I knew about it when I wrote the code, but happily forgot about
it (as it seldom happens on a single-user machine - I've never actually
seen it).

fsck should report "Zone XXXX: no file uses it, marked used in the
bitmap". If you get another message, please tell me. The reason this
happens is that I didn't know how to handle a truncate on a file that
was in use, so I ignored the problem, and forgot about it. I think I
have a solution, and I'll try to get it corrected in 0.12.

As far as I know, this bug is totally harmless (except for the message),
and just results in a unused block on the disk. fsck should repair it,
but if you got another message than the above, I'm wrong.

Sorry - misplaced that original mail - whenever I leave even for a short
time my mail box fills up with mundane sys admin mail, etc and I can't 
always find the good stuff.  

If you're calling int 16h BEFORE the protected mode switch, you should be 
fine.  Make sure you haven't cleared the interrupt flag.  As far as reading
the keyboard directly.... 

This gives a SCAN CODE, not an ASCII value, which must be converted
if you are interested in the value.  

You can use  an index into a translation table, but this means you must store 
all of the keys you are interested in in the table - a real pain.  You also
have to worry about shift states if case is significant, multibyte scan
codes, etc.

     Try getting pdisk.arc from wuarchive.wustl.edu in /mirrors/msdos/dskutl.
Someone else suggested edpart, but I tried it and like the program that comes
with pdisk better.  I'm not sure what the rest of it is, but there is a 
program called part.exe in the archive that will do what you want nicely. 
edpart dosen't seem to understand partitions >32meg and managed to mung
my partition table up a bit...  I used part.exe to set my formerly extended

I have finally had time to finish the SVGA-detector. This patch will
look for clues to determine if/what SVGA-card available. If it finds
a card it will ask (at boottime) if one wants to select from the modes
supported by the current card or just do a 'normal' init without SVGA-modes.
This is not the best thinkable way of doing this, I will work on a version
that can do the modeswitching from 'user-mode', which however is FAR more work than this straightforward hack. But the detection part of it must still lie 
in the kernel (at least that's simplest). But this is good enough to be 
usefull/easy to use.

I have uploaded this code to both nic.funet.fi and tsx-11.mit.edu.

I have only been able to test the Trident part of this code. People out
there with different cards could please test this and mail results. And even 
the Trident part is not guarateed to work since my card seems a bit strange.

Cards supported: ATI, Ahead, Chips & Tech., Cirrus, Everex, Genoa, Paradise,
Trident, Tseng, Video7. People with code to guess other cards and what modes
they support could mail me, or implement them themselves as long as it
gets spread.

Finally, the patch someone (can't remember who) sent out with the 'standard'
80x50 mode for VGA could be implemented in this code as an extra choice
but I can't remeber how one did it so could please someone send it to me,
and I can tuck it in at the end ...

	~ftp/pub/linux/patches/svga.tar.Z

edpart and pdisk have been uploaded from wuarcive and placed in:

I uploaded the last because it might be useful for people wanting to

3 h switched the screen to 132 column mode, and ESC [ ? 3 l set it back
to 80 columns.  hint, hint.  :-)

   >getgroups() is an optional POSIX system call, derived from BSD systems:

   I thought it was a required POSIX system call.

I stand corrected.  It is required;  I was getting confused by the fact
that NGROUPS_MAX can be 0, which means that there is no supplementary
groups support, and getgroups() will then also always return 0.

   Minix has { return 0; } for getgroups. This is good enough for fileutils
   to work.

I've fixed it by actually implementing getgroups() and setgroups(), as
well as POSIX_SAVED_IDS.  Patches have been sent to Linus; if you want
to look at them, they can be found in TSX-11.MIT.EDU in
~ftp/ALPHA/job-control/grppatch.tar.Z.  The patches are relative to
Linux 0.11 + the job control patches, but they shouldn't depend on the
job control changes except for silly things like system call numbering.

Note that programs which use the getgroups() call will depend on the
size of gid_t and will need recompiling when/if it gets changed.  gid_t
is currently a unsigned char, but I would strongly recommend that at
some point we change it to be an unsigned short (at least).  The problem
is that if we do this, all programs which use the stat() or fstat()
system call will also need recompiling.

Another change which is similar is MAXHOSTNAMELEN, which is currently 8.
To change it to something greater (I would suggest the BSD value of 64),
will require that all programs which use the uname() system call be
recompiled.  No big deal, except that /bin/sh is one of them.

Neither of these are particularly important to make, so perhaps we
should batch up all of these changes and make them at some future point,
at which point everyone will have to recompile all their binaries.

It was I who sent out the patches to get to 50 line mode.
I also implemented the Virtual Consoles coming in .12.
Note that it would be desirable to run a windowing system in one
VC and be able to switch to other text-mode consoles.
This means not using the bio (yuck) or finding a way
to use V86 mode to do the switching.  This would be nice
because it is a step towards DOS under Linux.

I finally found and corrected the problem I had with booting a 486/33 at
full speed.

The problem was the BIOS "Fast A20 Gate Option".  For UNIXes, this
should be DISABLED; for Mess-Dos, it seems to make no difference.

Oups, I seem to be forgetting the basics. I think I sent my previous
posting to someone personally instead of the list. Whoever it was,
sorry.

Anyway, how are the bigger (>32M) partitions meant to be formatted?
Now I know where to get a program to make them, but... Is there any
way other than getting a new dos (I have 3.30)? I am not going to pay
any more for dos than I've already paid, especially now that there is
linux for free! And actually, is even a newer dos a solution, haven't
they got the same 2-partition limit as the older ones, the partitions
just may be bigger? So, what program should I use to format these
beasts?

I suspect that you would want to use the raw I/O instructions to do the
switching, and not try to use BIOS in V86 mode.  I really don't know if
I'd want to trust the BIOS, and in any case, if you want real speed, you
will want to be talking to the VGA card directly anyway.  The X server
in the X11R5 tape already has code to talk to a couple of Super VGA
cards; it probably shouldn't be that hard the kernel mods integrated
with VC changes so that you can switch around.  

I've thought about what it would take to add V86 tasks; since each V86
task requires that it has 0-640k in Virtual space (you can't just give
it a segment), each V86 task would need to have its own set of page
tables that would have to be swapped in when it was running.  While this
would be tricky to implement (the task switching code would need to be
changed --- carefully), it has the advantage that we could at the same
time get rid of the 64 process limit.  For the 65th through 129th
process, we simply use another set of page tables, and so on.

We'd also want to intercept all of the BIOS and DOS interrupts and
replace them with blocking versions of the calls, so that the MS-DOS
tasks can run efficiently.  Yet some programs will try using the raw I/O
instructions, and in order to handle them we would need to trap
attempted I/O instructions and attempt to emulate them.  Then's there's
all of the memory-mapped video that would need to be emulating by

All-in-all a pretty big job....

--------

    I suspect that you would want to use the raw I/O instructions to do the
    switching, and not try to use BIOS in V86 mode.  I really don't know if
    I'd want to trust the BIOS, and in any case, if you want real speed, you
    will want to be talking to the VGA card directly anyway.  The X server

I disagree.  The actual mode setting will be called ONCE when the 
Xserver initializes.  Initialization code for all different VGA cards is 
often radically different - with registers spread all over the place,
with different values and functionality.   Saving a few hundred clock cycles 
one time on a machine with 20 to 40 million is not a big deal.

 
    in the X11R5 tape already has code to talk to a couple of Super VGA
    cards; it probably shouldn't be that hard the kernel mods integrated
    with VC changes so that you can switch around.  

    I've thought about what it would take to add V86 tasks; since each V86
    task requires that it has 0-640k in Virtual space (you can't just give
    it a segment), each V86 task would need to have its own set of page
    tables that would have to be swapped in when it was running.  While this
    would be tricky to implement (the task switching code would need to be
    changed --- carefully), it has the advantage that we could at the same
    time get rid of the 64 process limit.  For the 65th through 129th
    process, we simply use another set of page tables, and so on.

The appropriate CR is stored in the task state structure saved by the 386 - 
so switching can be basically automated.  You have some inteligence to
share the BIOS and manage the IO bitmaps though - to prevent contention
problems.  Also, V86 tasks can only address 1M + ~64K (address carry
present in 286's and above), requiring at most 256 + 16 second level 
table entries,  meaning a single secone level table (1024 entries 
MAX per table) and first table entry.  Spares for video memory bank 
switching are also desireable.  
(Excuse my terminology -= I can't keep tables and directories straight)


    We'd also want to intercept all of the BIOS and DOS interrupts and
    replace them with blocking versions of the calls, so that the MS-DOS
    tasks can run efficiently.  Yet some programs will try using the raw I/O

DOS does not need to be trapped.  You run one copy of DOS per VM - this saves
MANY reentrancy problems, etc.  As far as what needs to be trapped - 

1.  Disk BIOS should write to the Linux routines, with extraneous routines
    trapped - ie  no go for format, etc : we want a minimal functionality
    first.

2.  Video set mode int 10h function 0 should be trapped for mode, and 
    only allow VALID VGA modes, the setting of which will be sent to
    the Linux window program (outputing to X11)  All other BIOS 
    video accesses are OK except perhaps the set palette, which 
    we would probably only emulate at the register level (eventually)
    and let BIOS do it's thing.  Also, we need to keep track of 
    state for text / graphics.


3.  Any BIOS routines that talk to registers that are NOT being emulated.
    A simple solution would be to block any and all BIOS calls, a better 
    solution would be to change IOPL once in BIOS and cause all read / 
    writes to fault -, setting a blocking flag.  If the blocking flag is
    set, you wait until it is cleared by a ret / iret from the BIOS code.   

Video RAM access is handled by having a buffer allocated for each machine.
Text, and CGA are no problem at all - these are not bank switched, and
lack the special EGA / VGA ALU / barell shifter, plane mask, and 
bank switching used for 16 color modes.   Each task has its own 
video memory buffer.  You after a refresh alarm expires, you 
look at the accessed bits in the page table and update those regions that 
have changed.   

Trapping interrupts in DOS :
Not overly complicated.  When an INT, INT3, or INTO opcode is executed
in a vm task, it creates a general protection violation.  When you trap this 
fault, you examine the VM flag in the flags on the stack.  If it
is set, you use your special DOS handler which looks for one of these or 
other IOPL or VM sensitive instructions and perform the appropriate 
emulation.

   
 instructions, and in order to handle them we would need to trap
    attempted I/O instructions and attempt to emulate them.  Then's there's
    all of the memory-mapped video that would need to be emulating by
    putting in hooks to the VM code.

Other stuff for a complete emulation of real mode : 
trapping of EGA / VGA Palette, panning, and palette registers.
trapping of "normal" PIC mask register, timer ports, keyboard 
registers (tie to the ttyp of the Linux proram) and eventually maybe 
serial / parallel.  

It is a nice idea, and would make an incredible summer project 
after some one has ported X11R5 to Linux.  

Virtual 8086 mode allows you to use almost all of the BIOS and any DOS 
or other real mode OS underneath this mess.  You have a few interrupts 
that need dealing with, the hardware interrupts to simulate, and 
some ports to trap, but other than being an exercise in protected and 
VM program - it should be not overly difficult, just time consuming.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I'd be more worried about getting X11 up in the first place as distribution 
for R5 is around 150 megs.  The two possibilities I'm looking at right now
are 

1.  It is possible to use 
    NFS servers over serial lines.  A direct link, at 38.4K baud 
    could be made to a machine with disk and build done locally. 
    I think one such NFS program is PPP - are there others?

    How soon until sockets, rpc, etc are implemented on Linux?

2.  Large local SCSI disk 
	I've been offered a 340M SCSI drive real cheap (locally), 
     and am getting there on my SCSI drivers - after Winter USENIX is a 
     definite possibility for completion.


For work, we're currently installing X11R5 on our HP 68k Unix boxes - 
I'll see how soothly it goes and take a look at the Xserver code
to see what needs changing.  

Again, a lot of goodies like X hinge not only on some one having enough
disk space to do a build, but on availability of key Unix networking 
related features.......

   I disagree.  The actual mode setting will be called ONCE when the 
   Xserver initializes.

Well, it would be called when the X server initializes and each time you
switch bach and forth between Virtual Consoles.  I suppose you are right
that it won't be called enough to make it worthwhile.  I still would be
nervous about the BIOS code doing something funky like messing with the
interrupts and what not, but that's probably just an irrational fear on
my part.

   DOS does not need to be trapped.  You run one copy of DOS per VM -
   this saves MANY reentrancy problems, etc.  As far as what needs to be
   trapped -  

Well, in my conception DOS calls would be trapped and emulated by
calling the appropriate Linux filesystem routine, so that DOS programs
would be able to use Linux filesystems and Linux devices.  Once we get
the MS-DOS filesystem working in Linux, it could even get to MS-DOS
filesystems that way.  (!)

The first cut implementation probably would just run native DOS in each
task, though, since that is much easier.

   It is a nice idea, and would make an incredible summer project 
   after some one has ported X11R5 to Linux.  

Agreed; this would be a very big project!  You actually don't need to
port X11 R5, though.  It could just be done on top of Virtual Consoles,
and in fact it may be easier to do it that way, and worry about the X
interface later.  

We probably shouldn't worry about it too much until after we get Linux
in a much more polished state, though.

   I'd be more worried about getting X11 up in the first place as distribution 
   for R5 is around 150 megs.  

Well, you don't need to grab the whole thing.  The X library is 3 meg,
and the Xt toolkit is another 1.1 meg.  You may also need the Xmu library
which is ~350k.  Then the device dependent portion of the X server is
800k (and you don't need all of it), and the device independent portion
of the X server is 1200k or so.  (All of these sizes are source only,
with no RCS directories).

A lot of the X11R5 distribution are big, (somewhat) useless things like
games and demo programs, and then there are the big, slow, and really
useless things like Motif.  If you strip out all of those programs, X11
really isn't as big as you might think....

All of this really doesn't matter until we get sockets and networking
running, at which point SLIP, NFS and SCSI support might be in the
kernel already, making the whole space issue moot.  My, it's nice to
dream, isn't it!  :-)

Two things.  First I think bios and therefore V86 access will be required
if for no other reason than because two many clone vendors rely on it
to deliver "compatibility".

Second.  Before X11 can even be looked at, another feature will be 
required.  That is, shared dynamic linked libraries.  I just finished
working on a   Decstation 3100 for 6 months using Ultrix which does 
not have this.  The executables are monsterous, and the only thing
they eat more of than disk space is memory.  Plus, if Linux is to
be distributed over ftp, and we wish to permit access to distributing 
binaries, then much net-width can be saved. But most of all, since
Linux is fast evolving, if we want to avoid frequent recompiles of
all utilities every time a library routine changes (such as job 
control requires) then we better get shared libs fast.

The moral of the tale is, if anyone out there is currently idle,
and knows something about compilers, and is willing to tackle 
shared libs, please step forward at the sound of the tone.

Linus has had the same prob. The strange thing is that the code to do the 
'guessing' is taken from a book/vga-doc files that says that it has been
tested to work properly ! If anybody knows how to do it please let me know.
I have read the postings about BIOS or no BIOS in SVGA-handling, and I would
just like to say (in my deffence :-) that this is just a small hack to help
people having bigger screens (remember Linux is still beta-version) and it
is not meant to be installed for good. I will work on a stand alone program
to do mode-switching from a runing shell, it's just that that is A LOT more
work. This code was finnished in a rush, mainly to let people test the 'feature'
and to test the somewhat inconsistent card-detection code (I do only have one 
card to test on :-) And for that purpose the BIOS can be used since it's just a
int-call from the setup which is running in native mode so the BIOS-call there
really do no harm, it's just a MUCH more simple way of doing it instead of
doing direct I/O to the card. And by all means nobody is forced to use the
patch :-)

A couple of points.  First of all, job-control does *not* require
recompiling all of the utilities.  /bin/bash needs to be recompiled with
the job control commands built in, of course, but that's about it.

Secondly, many of the changes which I (at least) have been talking about
requiring recompiling all of the utilities because they mean that the
system /usr/include files would have to be change, and the structures
passed back from the kernel would change as the sizes changed.  A
dynamically linked library wouldn't solve this problem.

Finally, people should be aware that many shared libraries implemented
under Unix are not fully "dynamically linked" --- that is, when you
change the library, you often have to relink all of the utilities or
they won't work at all.  These designs are great for conserving disk
space, but they're hell for evolving systems, because with statically
linked programs, at least you know they will always work as long as the
kernel interface remains constant.  With shared libraries, often times
replacing the library will cause all the programs which relied on the
old version of the library to break, even if the kernel hasn't changed
at all.  It is possible to do it right, but whoever tackles this one
needs to be careful about the design....

   before X11 can be ported to Linux?  I'm curious about how far away
   Linux is from X11.  Thanks!

Well, I believe the only unimplemented feature which is absolutely
required is Berkeley-style sockets (or a socket emulation library,
although the real thing would be preferable, IMHO).  There are a lot of
features which would be helpful but not required.  They include:

  *	Networking code that goes with the socket() implementation
  *	Symbolic links, to make dealing with the source tree easier
  *	SCSI disk driver, to make it easier to hook up big fast disks
		so you have room for the complete X11 distribution
  *	Shared libraries, to make the (many) X executables smaller and
		usable on systems with small amounts of memory.

I suspect that implementing the above items could be done in parallel
with porting the X server, once we have BSD-style sockets.  The port of
the X server itself may not be trivial, so one should not discount that;
however, getting the X clients to build should be fairly easy, as long
as you have the disk space.

I've been meaning to do these for a long time: but something has always
come in the way - this time it was the VFS patches: I want those in

When my init is done, what you do is start lp, gettys, and any other
such stuff with runlevel 2. So they get killed when runlevel changes
to 's'. Then write a shutdown script that sets run level to s, then
cleans everything up, kills any remaining demons, unmounts
filesystems, etc. Then syncs a few times, and says "Ready to power
down or reboot" and just sit there.

> what do you folks w/uucp do? will this be

There is no uucp for linux yet as far as I know. When I get done with
init and login next thing I'll do is try to get Taylor UUCP working.
t is a public domain uucp, pretty comapatible, and with some extra

P.S I have a tcsh6.01 working on Linux, I need also some tests on It ... if
    people on the mailing list are interested I'll post it too.

Ciao.

saving in uemacs: ^X S not ^X^S as in the real one.
No warm reboot: I have the same problem as do more people I know of, the 
problem is (as I know it) the AMI-bios in my computer, do you have an AMI ?
If so that's almost surely the reason. Anybody knows why ? I haven't looked
into it. You always have the red button ... :-)

Linus has tested a new aproach to detecting Tseng which works. I have also
looked closer at the code for Genoa, I had screwed things up a bit so to say.
I think that's why it detected a Paradise as a Genoa :-)
Anyway I have uploaded a file called newsvga.tar.Z to tsx-11 and nic which
include the new Tseng and the corrected (hopefully :-) Genoa. It is a new
diff which should be applied to the original setup.s not the patched one.
I cross my fingers that this one works :-)

Subject: what's wrong with ESDI?
From: Mika Matti Jalava <r36110m@kaira.hut.fi>

What might be the problem with my ESDI drive that I've tried to get
running with linux? It is a Magtron MT-4115E and the controller is
Joincom.

The problems: I start linux with root on floppy. I get a message like
"unexpected hd interrupt", but immediately after that "partition table
ok.". I try fdisk, and that tells just right what's there on the disk
(a 32 M primary dos and the rest of 115 M as an extended "don't
use"-partition), but right after that an I/O-error, and if I remember
it was on on device /dev/hd5! I don't even have a second drive. It
might have been hd0 though, I'll check it. Anyway, what's this
unexpected interrupt? I think it shouldn't be too much work making the
ESDI drive work, as it "half works" even now. The 20 M MFM drive I'm
using now is getting a bit small...

There are several of us working on it.  I've played with both the Taylor
package and Will Rose's UUCP 1.2  The former needs quite a few library
functions that haven't been implemented yet.  I've made some progress with
the latter but I haven't finished yet, no time :-(

	I am running Linux on a 33MHz 386dx clone with an AMI BIOS.
	I have never had any problem doing a three finger salute (warm
        reboot).

	For some reason though, kermit (the binary from tsx-11) doesn't
	seem to be working, although other copies work fine under both
	Minix and msdos.  Any ideas?  Should I just get the package from
	columbia and build it myself?

Subject: bugs in linux 0.11 and Q's about alarm()
Date: Thu, 9 Jan 1992 14:34:56 +0900
From: comrade@uniwa.uwa.oz.au (Peter Cooper)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi


First a few Q's about the alarm() call.

I had the impression that if a 'slow' system call was processing and
an alarm signal was recieved, that the slow call would return EINTR.

Is this in fact the behaviour expected? I have a program that relies on
the fact that the system call is aborted with EINTR rather than simply
being restarted by the kernel. (I have hacked my kernel so that
tty_read() return -EINTR, rather than -ERESTARTSYS )

Does POSIX say anything about this??

Also:
	There is a bug in kernel/chr_drv/tty_io.c

At the end of the tty_read() fn, there is a line that reads

	current->alarm = oldalarm;

This SHOULD read
	
	if (flag)
		current_alarm = oldalarm;

Flag is set if tty_read uses it's own alarm.

The effect of this bug was to produce 2 alarm signals if an alarm occured
while read()'ing instead of the single signal it should produce.

Also:
	Something very odd seems to be happening when there is a key in
the keyboard buffer.
I have code like:

main() {
	signal(SIGALRM, handler);
	alarm(2);
	read(0, buff, 40);
	printf("All ok\n");
        }

handler() { printf("Alarm\n"); fflush(stdout); }

Now this works fine if you just run it. In 2 seconds it tells you that the
alarm went off. BUT if you run it and type a key before the alarm goes off,
then the alarm doesn't occur untill the buffer is empty. i.e. untill you
backspace to the beginning of the line, or you hit return.

NOTES: The alarm definately doesn't occur. I have code that has the alarm simply
set a variable, and it only runs once, no matter how long you wait before
emptying the buffer.

What on earth is happening when there is a key in the buffer? It happens
in other places as well. Try doing...

cat < /dev/tty4 > /dev/tty64
cat < /dev/tty64 > /dev/tty4

(note. I have the virtual consoles installed. )

Then get a bunch of stuff comming down the serial port.
If you type a key while it is comming down, it will stop dead until you
delete it or hit return, regardless that bytes are pouring continously
down the serial line. I am very confused as to why this occurs...

FYI:
	I have a 486/33 with a 120Mb IDE drive. I have jobcontrol and
	lvc-4th installed. I am using shoelace to boot. I have 4Mb of
	memory.

PS: Just an aside: Does anyone know why 
	doshell /dev/tty64 /bin/sh
doesn't properly attach a shell to the serial port?? Dialing in through
the modem doesn't get you a shell.

Also, when you do by rather incredible contortions do get a shell on it,
you don't get a prompt
	(We achived it by dailingthe machine under DOS, rebooting to
	linux without hangingup and then running doshell /dev/tty64
	/bin/sh. running doshell from /etc/rc DOESN'T work. doing it by
	hand produces a shell with no prompt. Vi doesn't complain about
	it not haveing a term to work on. What gives? anyone ?? )

and a login shell. i needed it to test out setuid/setgid for the
lp stuff, since it fiddles with the permissions ala BSD.
        enjoy!

Subject: linux partition trashed by windows 3 (maybe..)

AAGH!

This is the second time its happened - the first time I put it down to some 
0.10 fs bugs, but this time some text in the corruption gave it away as
windows 3 (and in particular Word Perfect for Windows - again.) Since it
only seems to happen when WP4W has been used I'd guess that it's either WP4W
itself, or windows 3 swapping a large program (never had any problems with
write, etc.) Has anyone else had such a problem? [I know this isn't really
a linux problem, but..] 

Never mind - I had full backups, of course [ha ha :-(]. A question: is there
any way, or how hard would it be to get a way of mapping a given range of
physical memory into a user process's address space - I'm thinking of the
full screen addressing provided by many (most?) vga cards..

This is corrected in my version (and will be in 0.12) - the alarm is no
longer used, as I got tired of the contortions needed, so I added a
simple "timeout" to the task-structure.  Thus system calls with a
timeout now don't need to mess with saving alarm etc. Using alarm had
another problem: if it was blocked, the task wouldn't be awakened by it.
This was no problem in versions < 0.11, but the current version needed
something better.

I have hacked on the tty's quite a bit, and although I never saw this
problem, I hope it is corrected: I simplified some things in the
drivers, and I think it should work (also, I've hacked pty's till they
aren't recognizeable: I think I have the stalling bug fixed.)

While changing (and simplifying) the virtual consoles, I also changed
them to use EGA/VGA screen memory, so that they won't take up space in
the kernel.  This means that the vc's in 0.12 will work only on a
EGA/VGA, and I hope that won't be any problem. It shouldn't be too hard
to patch it back to use a kernel buffer though.

   Is this in fact the behaviour expected? I have a program that relies on
   the fact that the system call is aborted with EINTR rather than simply
   being restarted by the kernel. (I have hacked my kernel so that
   tty_read() return -EINTR, rather than -ERESTARTSYS )

   Does POSIX say anything about this??

POSIX doesn't say a whole lot about this, and it's somewhat confusing
what it does say.  The problem is that 99% of the code out there
*doesn't* check for EINTR, so restarting a system call generally works
as a better default.  The problem is that you do lose in the case where
you're expecting the system call to be interrupted.  

You don't need to hack the kernel to change what tty_read() returns to
solve your problem, however.  You just need to set the sigaction flag
SIG_INTERRUPT for the alarm signal, and then the signal handling code in
the kernel will set things up so that the system call returns with EINTR
after the signal handler is finished.

It may make sense to set the default flag for the alarm signal so that
SA_INTERRUPT is set.  But then again, it may not.  I suspect that no
matter which default you pick, some set of programs will lose because
they're either expecting the EINTR and they don't get it, or they're not
prepared to handle the EINTR and they die when they get it.
Fortunately, there is a programming interface to select which behavior
you want, but that may mean that you need to recompile your program to
set the sigaction flag in order to make things work.

I have just recently started using linux.  With some help from people

But when I recompile the image and attempt to use it my keyboard is messed

Hi, all.  I'm not on the list (yet), so if you reply to this, include me
in the CC:.

Eventually, people are going to want to do networking on Linux.  And
they're going to want to do it with a bunch of different Ethernet
boards.  Well, there is a bunch of freely copyable (copyleft to be
specific) MS-DOS Ethernet drivers called the Clarkson packet driver
collection.  I'm the editor of that collection.

These drivers all use a common skeleton that interfaces between FTP
Software's Packet Driver Specification, and the code that's specific
to each card.  That code could be reused if someone could find a way
to keep most of the entry points identical, or at least similar.  If
the entry points into the device-specific code need to be changed,
maybe we could find a way to do it so that all the drivers can get
ported at the same time?

I'd do it myself, but I've never seen the source for a Unix Ethernet driver.
Does anyone know how such code is structured?  I've got a book on Unix device
drivers, so I ought to be able to understand it if I could just see it...

     Some things might not be being remade quite right.  I have problems with 
this quite a bit, and have just gotten in the habit of doing a 'make clean'
then re-making the entire kernel.  Anyone know why remaking parts of the 
kernel doesn't seem to work?  A friend of mine has the same problem.

	Some things might not be being remade quite right.  I have
   problems with this quite a bit, and have just gotten in the habit of
   doing a 'make clean' then re-making the entire kernel.  Anyone know
   why remaking parts of the kernel doesn't seem to work?  A friend of
   mine has the same problem. 

The problem is in how the dependancies of the make files are set up.
Each subdirectory has a bunch of .o files (which depend on the .c and
the .h files), which are assembled to gether to form one "subassembly"
.o file for the subdirectory.  So for example, all of the .o files in
the kernel subdirectory are linked together to form kernel.o, and all of
the .o files in the fs subdirectory are linked to gether to form fs.o

The problem is that the "image" file is created by linking the
subassembly files together (fs.o, kernel.o, etc.), and the top-level
makefile only knows that about this dependency; it has no way of knowing
that since the .h files have changed, the .o files making up the
kernel.o file have changed, and it needs to cd into the kernel
subdirectory and do a remake.  This could be fixed by adding more
dependency rules, but it would substantially complicate the make files.

Actually, I'm not sure why we have the second level .o files, unless it
is to speed up the linking of the kernel when you are only making
changes in one part of the kernel.  It would probably faster if the top
level make file assembled the "image" file from the component .o files,
and the dependencies were all in the top level make file.

I doubt you are running out of memory.  Are you sure that your ~177k
file isn't corrupted?  Typically you will get an out of memory error if
the .Z file was FTP'ed in ASCII mode instead of binary mode or some such
thing.

First a disclaimer: I haven't locked at the FTP Packet Driver
Specification; but I suspect the one place that will be a problem is
interrupt handling.  Presumably the Clarkson drivers are interrupt
driven and not polling off the clock tick, right?  I suspect that if
they're clock tick driven, it would make things easier but it would make
performance suffer a lot.  If they are interrupt driven, then you need
to worry about installing a 386 protected-mode interrupt gate, and
saving all of the 386 32-bit registers; and if the drivers were designed
for the 16-bit DOS world, they might not be up to handling this.

Also, how nailed-down is the interface between the "common" portion of
the packet driver and the "device specific" portion of the packet
driver?  I suspect that we would want to dump the "common" portion of
the driver and speak directly to the "device specific" portion.

Having an Ethernet driver sounds like a really cool thing!  Of course,
the thing that would really interest me is a SLIP driver....  :-)

Here is an excerpt from /usr/linux/include/linux/config.h:
/*
 * define your keyboard here -
 * KBD_FINNISH for Finnish keyboards
 * KBD_US for US-type
 * KBD_GR for German keyboards
 * KBD_FR for Frech keyboard
 */
/*#define KBD_US */
/*#define KBD_GR */
/*#define KBD_FR */
#define KBD_FINNISH

And KBD_FINNISH is the default. Change it to KBD_US and you should get
it right.

I have seen this problem too, on a MikroMikko 4m346 (also known as
Alfaskop 4m346) from ICL Data. The funny thing is that the warm boot
works on model 4m336SX from the same manufacturer. The machine doesn't
have a reset button, and the power switch isn't even red!

Various users have noted that their machines don't work right after
warm boot. Sorry, I'm not able to help, but if it helps anything, I
can tell that something has changed from 0.10 to 0.11: With 0.10 my

Are there any plans to implement the select() sys call sometime ??
If no-one is looking at it, does anyone know where I can find detailed
specs on what select does, and a rought idea of how it should be implemented?

	   When the list gets bigger we might have more trouble
	   request messages on wrong address .. I really want to
	   prevent that. And this is yet an other reason for
	   the news group.

I had earlier proposed a mail digestifer <-> news group gateway; well, I
finally have that software working on my system.  What it does is this:

	*) Mail sent to List-Name is posted to the newsgroup.

	*) News group articles are collected together and sent when they
		comprise a digest of between 20k and 30k, or if that
		doesn't happen in 6 hours, the news group articles are
		flushed out into a digest.

(All of the numbers, like the 20k, 30k, and the 6 hours can be adjusted
as appropriate.)

The general idea is that we can use this to replace the Linux Activists
lists at some point.  The question is when do do we do this and how.

I actually don't have very strong opinions about whether we do
alt.os.linux now, and transition to comp.os.linux later, or whether we
start the process for comp.os.linux now, and start doing the transition
60 days from now, or whether we just wait for a while if the pure
mailing solution is still holding up.

Linus, Ari, what do you think?  If you want, I can turn on the software
on relatively little notice; it's already been installed on my news
server.  

For people on the list: how many of you would prefer to get this mailing
list via news?  How many of you would be able to receive alt.os.linux?
How many of you would be able to receive comp.os.linux?  How many of you
would prefer to receive this via mail regardless?  PLEASE DO NOT REPLY
TO THE LIST.  MAIL ONLY TO ME, AND I WILL SUMMARIZE.  Thank you!

I hacked together a (very rough) select system call, as well as pseudo
ttys (even rougher) and submitted them with VC to Linus.  In further 
correspondence with him, I believe Linus has both of these smoothed out
and integrated in 0.12.  If your looking for a project, maybe you 
could try symbolic links (maybe see plains.nodak.edu:pub/Minix/usenet/
1991.Jun/symlink.sh) or shared dynamic link libraries (thorny).

Here is the nice and renice utilities for setting the priority of jobs
at startup and while running respectively.  It does not include
the system call sys_renice, which is trivial to implement, so renice
doesn't actually work right now.   Note that nice (and renice)
should be checking that the caller is root if priority is negative.
At least I think the system call should do the checking?

Select is already implemented, will be in 0.12. It was originally by
pmacdona, although I have hacked it quite heavily. It currently works
(not too much testing though) on pipes and tty's (including pty's).

I'm hoping that MGR could sometime be ported to linux: does anyone know
what more it wants - we've got pty's and select, but no /dev/screen yet.
Is there anything else mgr wants?

To: Linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

Ok, as I didn't implement the VFS-patches (they seemed a bit raw), I
found that I no longer had any excuse for not implementing symbolic
links, so I did :) I haven't tested them very much yet (don't you get
tired of me saying that? But it usually works anyway), but the small
tests I have done have worked out beautifully.  So 0.12 (still due out
wednesday January 15th unless I get problems) will have them. 

One problem is that I disallowed nesting links - does anybody feel this
is too much of a restriction? Hope not, 'cause 0.12 won't have nested
links, and that's final (unless someone wants to pay me huge sums of
money for it).

Note that the symlinks will require a new fsck (don't worry, I've made
the changes already), so you'll have to install some things from the new
root-floppy when you install 0.12. Or something like that.

0.12 will still have these known bugs:
 - the serial line sometimes locks up.  I don't know why, and I don't
   want to know.  I want a patch that fixes it :-)
 - Some harddisks don't like linux (even though they should).  Maybe not
   a bug, but a deficiency.

New bugs (possibly):
 - When using VM, there are /a lot/ new possibilities for race
   conditions.  I haven't heard about problems from those few that have
   tested it, so maybe it's ok.  Knock wood.
 - The job control bash for 0.12 is version 1.10, which has a bug with
   command completion. Not fatal, but irritating. 1.11 should hopefully
   be out soon.

The current suggested fix is to wait for 0.12: this particular problem
should be solved (knock wood).  If you cannot wait for 3 days, there
were some timeouts you can change, but I forgot which: they are in
blk_drv/hd.c.  I /think/ this was solved in the VM prerelease (on
amaru), but that one has other problems (memory size hardcoded for

I've copied the 0.11  "bootimage" onto a 1.44M diskette and attempted to
boot off it. It gets as far as "Loading system..." and then says

   HD-controller reset failed: 80
   Kernel panic: HD controller not ready

I also see a small "EGAc" in the upper right corner of the screen.

I've been running protected mode minix on this machine (a 20MHz 386 Everex
Tempo LX laptop, VGA display, IDE controller)
using the vanilla at_wini.c driver with no problems.

I recall being able to boot the old 0.10 version of linux with no problems,
although I just played on the diskette and never tried to mount a HD
filesystem.

Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

I just tried using version 0.10 of "bootimage" to run version 0.11
of "rootimage". The system comes up fine. I can access the harddisk ok,
for example by running "cp /dev/hd0 /dev/null".

But when running "fdisk", I get:

/dev/hd1: ..stuff about partition 1...
/dev/hd2: ..stuff about partition 2...
/dev/hd3: ..stuff about partition 3...
harddisk I/O error
dev 0305 block 0

and the program terminates. Now device 0305 is /dev/hd5 (ie. 2nd harddisk),
but I don't have a 2nd harddisk. Does linux for some reason expect TWO
harddisks? Is this the reason I'm unable to boot version 0.11 of the
kernel (as described in my previous message)?

No, this is totally normal: the kernel tries to read from the second
harddisk, and fails.  No problem.  The reason that 0.10 works, but 0.11
doesn't, is that I changed 0.11 so that it does a hd-reset at bootup,
mostly to test the code.  Ok it wasn't so great an idea, but it showed
up the bug in the reset-code.

If you can get linux up and running on some machine (0.10 works, but has
bugs, so 0.11 is better), you can make a new 0.11 that works somewhat
just by changing the line

static int reset = 1;

to

static int reset = 0;

at the head of hd.c, and recompiling the kernel.  This works, but
ignores the deeper problem of not being able to reset the disk.  I still
think you'd better wait for 0.12: it's ready, but I want to test
everything out for a bit yet.  I was still adding things to it
yesterday, now I'm just playing around, and trying to see if 0.12 fails.

		Linus

PS. Ignore my warning about bugs in bash-1.10: bash 1.11 came out
yesterday (the day before?), and was very easy to port to linux. I
haven't found any bugs yet.

After seeing a couple of people asking this same question, I decided
I'd reply to the list instead of individually (sorry to the majority
who probably know this).

It is normal behavior for fdisk to report the errors about /dev/hd5,
etc, if you do not have a second hard disk.  I am not sure which of
the following is correct, however

	1) fdisk has it hard coded to check a second hard disk

	2) fdisk checks on all /dev/hd*'s

I am not able to check since I am not at home, but suffice to say that
it is normal.  I think this was written somewhere, was it not?

Derek Lieber:  This has nothing to do with the fact that you cannot
get 0.11 to mount your HD.  This is a seperate bug that will
(hopefully) be fixed in 0.12.  Linus has stated that it is.  It has to
do, from my understanding, that some delays in the HD init are not
long enough?  Anyways...I'm getting over my head...

Writing UNIX Device Drivers
By George Pajari
(c) 1992
Published by Addison-Wesley
ISBN 0-201-52374-4
323 pages, Paperback
$32.95


This book provides application programmers with definitive
information on writing device drivers for the UNIX operating
system. It explains, through working examples, the issues
related to the design and implementation of these important
components of applications programs.

Written by an acknowledged expert, the book uses full source
code listings of real devices to explain the underlying concepts.

Complete source code is provided for 12 drivers, including:

A small word of warnig: linux looks like a unix, but I implemented it
from scratch, and with very little litterature on how things "should" be
done.  In fact the only things I knew were how the interface should
appear to the user: the result is not the same as either minix, sysv or
bsd when it comes to the kernel innards.  Some of the choises I made
worked out well, some not so well.  So far nothing has been a total
disaster: most things have been relatively easily adaptible to the linux
kernel (demand-loading and paging comes to mind: they were essentially
painless to do for linux).

This doesn't mean that this book wouldn't be very practical (it probably
is), but it does mean that you cannot take the code and use it directly
for linux.  Of course the underlying algorithm may well work splendidly. 

The three books I had as references were:

"Maurice J Bach: The design of the unix operating system". This is a
nice general text, and has some simple algorithms for some things.
Recommended.

"Tanenbaum: Operating Systems, Design and Implementation". Hmm. I didn't
use this book much for the actual implementation (other than getting the
minix filesystem design out of it), but unless you understand the
principles ast writes about, unix kernel hacking is difficult at best.

"Crawford & Gelsinger: Programming the 80386". What can I say. If you
want to program the 386-specific stuff, this is a must.

I just signed up for this list. As far as I could tell there is no stty
available for linux yet so I went ahead and wrote one, I'm also adding
features it needs to perform the same function as getty. 
The todo file says the init program is needed, if no one has done this yet
I would be interested. 
Is ps available yet? 
Assuming there isn't an stty program available that I missed, I can send the
stty code to any one who is interested.

I'm really impressed with what I have seen so far, I've been hoping something
like this would come along for years :)

My init is almost done, should have been done a while ago but I was
busy with "real work" (things all crashing for various strange
reasons)

I still need to write the stuff that lets it chnge run-levels though
(I think I will limit it to only 2 levels, so I can use signals
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, does anyone see any problems with this?)

The VFS that is available as alpha (tsx-11, ALPHA) has the problem that
it wants you to rewrite almost everything when you add a filesystem (ie,
have a minix_open, and a ffs_open etc), which I find a bit boring, and
also makes for somewhat ugly code (several versions of essentially the
same set of functions). I decided that I didn't want to lock into that
yet: it might still be the way linux goes, but I don't want to have an
official release that binds me to something I think could maybe be
implemented cleaner.

VFS will come, but I'd rather see it (I'll implement it too, perhaps) as
a collection of just the low-level routines (read_inode(),
write_inode(), read_dir_entry(), write_dir_entry(), _bmap() etc), where
the general routines like "link()" etc would be the same for all
systems.

The scenario was a uemacs with 2 'windows', I had exited uemacs several times

      These drivers all use a common skeleton that interfaces between FTP
      Software's Packet Driver Specification, and the code that's specific
      to each card.  That code could be reused if someone could find a way
      to keep most of the entry points identical, or at least similar.  If
      the entry points into the device-specific code need to be changed,
      maybe we could find a way to do it so that all the drivers can get
      ported at the same time?

   First a disclaimer: I haven't looked at the FTP Packet Driver
   Specification; but I suspect the one place that will be a problem is
   interrupt handling.  Presumably the Clarkson drivers are interrupt
   driven and not polling off the clock tick, right?  I suspect that if
   they're clock tick driven, it would make things easier but it would make
   performance suffer a lot.  If they are interrupt driven, then you need
   to worry about installing a 386 protected-mode interrupt gate, and
   saving all of the 386 32-bit registers; and if the drivers were designed
   for the 16-bit DOS world, they might not be up to handling this.

Most of the drivers could be rewritten to operate in a polled mode.  The
3501 and ni5010 will not work that way, because they don't have a buffer
large enough.

   Also, how nailed-down is the interface between the "common" portion of
   the packet driver and the "device specific" portion of the packet
   driver?  I suspect that we would want to dump the "common" portion of
   the driver and speak directly to the "device specific" portion.

Right, that's what I'm proposing -- to keep the device specific portion,
and talk to it from protected mode.

   Having an Ethernet driver sounds like a really cool thing!  Of course,
   the thing that would really interest me is a SLIP driver....  :-)

SLIP isn't as tough because it's based on the serial ports...

   The current file system has no impressive performance, and
   was hoping the addition of FFS would improve the situation.

Note that a lot of the basic ideas of the FFS can be implemented without
changing the filesystem format....  for example, the idea of having
cylinder groups and allocating blocks trying to make sure that a file is
in one cylinder group.

Of course, you really can't change the 14 char limit without chaging the
filesystem format, although I could think of some really ugly kludges
one could use to make the change in a backward compatible way...

If we're going to redesign the filesystem format, perhaps we should
start making wish lists (keeping in mind that it may not be practical to
implement them all).  My wish list item is per-file ACL's, with
expansion room to handle network-authenticated entities: i.e., Kerberos
principals or X.500 DN's (yeah, right).

Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but.....

After a panic, the Linux OS is looping in kernel mode, waiting for the
user to type the reboot key.  (No other processes are going to be able
to execute.)  How are you going to be able to do the setterm -dump n?

One comment: when people send in kernel crash reports, they should make
sure they specify which version of the kernel they are using.
Obviously, if you are using a kernel with patches, it's going to be very
difficult to figure out which routine was responsible by looking at the
EIP output.  Hopefully in the future, the kernel will be able do crash
dumps, and we will have crash dump analysis programs to figure out where
things actually were dying.

   Which brings me to the question I've always wanted to ask:
   How do you use FFS on a SCSI disk? Given that SCSI disc's use
   logicial sectors and automatic bad sector remapping, it doesn't
   make much sence to talk of cylinder groups. Is it possible
   to avoid the logicial mapping?

The short answer is: with great difficulty, and not without a lot of
success. 

Usually, SCSI disks will generally keep logical sector whose block
numbers which are close together in the same general area of the
physical disk, but this is not guaranteed.  Depending on how automatic
bad sector remapping is done, the revectored blocks may be at the far
end of the disk, or scattered through out the disk.

So the FFS algorithms can be somewhat useful on SCSI disks by
distributing files across the entire disk, and by reducing (somewhat)
disk head activity by keeping files in the localized area wrt logical
sector numbers.  But of course it will not be as successful as when the
kernel has a much better idea of where blocks will end up on the
platters.

Another thing which comes up with SCSI disks is that the elevator sort
algorithm (which sorts the disk blocks in the request queue in an
attempt to reduce head movement) will also not work as well as
traditional disk controllers, again because there's no guarantee that
the logical sector numbering has any relationship to the physical blocks
(although there usually is some).  However, there is usually some cache
memory on the SCSI controllers on the disk drives themselves to help
this situation a bit.

Fortunately, the CPU time required to do the elevator sort and the FFS
placement of disk blocks is small enough that it gets swamped by the
time to do the disk I/O.  So even if the elevator sort and the FFS don't
help as much for SCSI disks, it shouldn't cost that much to use the
algorithms in any case.

While we are discussing what we are missing for X, I would like to

someone who has the spec's available for several mice put an autoconfig
mouse driver in the kernel.  This might actually be of use before X,
but I can't think of anything right off....

I suppose it would make more sense to write it, but not put it in the
kernel until it was needed -- linux is small and clean; no need to throw
junk at it until we need the junk...

   While we are discussing what we are missing for X, I would like to
   mention one small thing -- /dev/mouse.  It would be a cute trick if
   someone who has the spec's available for several mice put an autoconfig
   mouse driver in the kernel.  This might actually be of use before X,
   but I can't think of anything right off....

The 386 X server sources in the X11R5 distribution comes with support
for the following mice: MicroSoft, MouseSystems, MMSeries, Logitech,
Mouseman, BusMouse.  Except for the BusMouse, all of the other formats
just require access to the serial port.  You don't need to put
the mouse support in the kernel, except for the BusMouse case, and even
then most of the hard work can and should be done out of the kernel.

One thing which will require some kernel work for the X server is to add
some ioctl()'s to the console for switching it to direct mode, where you
get scancodes instead of ASCII characters (X will do its own keyboard
mapping and remapping), and some other ioctl()'s to do set and reset the
keyboard LED's, and start and stop the speaker at a specified pitch,
etc., etc.  But that shouldn't be too hard to do, although I don't know
how easy it will be to make these changes work with the Virtual Console
mode --- we do want to be able to have an X server running in one VC,
and be able to switch into another VC to do debugging work.

To: Linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

Ok, the subject says it all. The kernel source and the disk-images are
available on nic.funet.fi, and I'm assuming they will migrate to other
places in a couple of days. There is a RELNOTES-0.12, but installation
is similar to 0.11, so the installinfo in relnotes is pretty minimal.

Note that even users of 0.11 should boot up from floppy first and copy
all the binaries to their proper places on the harddisk partition: fsck,
ls etc have changed with symlinks, and bash (/bin/sh) due to job
control.

Also note that I've decided to change the copyright to have the same set
of rules as the GNU copyleft - I got some mail asking about it, and I
agree.  The old copyright still holds for now - I want to make sure none
of the "co-authors" would mind, but I'm pretty sure they won't. It won't
actually change the copyright very much: it's the handling-costs extra
etc.

I'll send some additional files (the complete fileutils, the new library
and libc.a etc) tomorrow.

With all this talk about X servers and such, I was thinking about
writing some graphics programs which would be able to do their work
outside the kernel, by accessing video memory directly. Does linux
let one establish a mapping between a region of a process's virtual
address space and a region of physical memory (I'm thinking of
something like the shmxxx" family of system calls for dealing with
shared memory)?

	Well, I think you must mean the Quantum 210, since they don't
(to my knowledge, and I know the quantum line pretty well) make a 240
meg drive.  I've got a Quantum (Plus Impulse) 210AT, and while I haven't
tested Linux on it, Mach likes it quite a bit.  The geometry of the drive is
873 cyls, 13 heads, 36 secs/track.  Maybe this will help people who know
more about what Linux likes and doesn't like answer your question.  I
haven't, to be honest, brought Linux up yet myself, but I intend to use a
Quantum 105AT for it.

Linux 0.12 is available from TSX-11.MIT.EDU.  For most U.S. sites, it
will be much faster if you grab the distribution from TSX-11 than from
nic.funet.fi.  

I will grab the 0.12 libc.a sources and include file, and any other

    Greetings,
        Being a novice at fun stuff like kernel development and device
    driver design, I'd like to know under what circumstances I'd need
    a SCSI driver.

        I have a 20Meg floptical disk drive that MS/DOS thinks is just
    another drive.  No device drivers are needed, etc...  It is,
    however, a SCSI device.  Does this mean that I'll need a driver
    for it under Linux?

Yes.  Most definately.   The current SCSI situation is that I'm working on 
a multi-tiered driver (interference from fried SCSI hosts, family visits,
long ski weekends, sysadmin chores and Usenix) with abstract high level 
disk and tape drivers that interface with low level SCSI drivers in a 
device independant manner.  The low level driver needed for each SCSI host
merely has to send SCSI commands and return the results / data to the 
high level driver- bad block remapping, etc are all handled by the 
high level driver.  


The initial low level driver will be for the seagate ST-01 / ST-02 
controllers.  Other hosts should be fairly easy to adapt to - see 
the interface spec following this.


        Does anyone have any good kernel and driver design books that
    they can refer me to?

                                             --  Morgan Schweers

--------

Current interface spec for SCSI driver - should have everything 
(keeping my fingers crossed here) ready within two weeks after 
Usenix.  I've added a command queing function, where the driver is 
notified on command completion, so that multiple read/writes etc. can
be accomplished - much better than the kernel blocking until the 
read/write was done....

From: Linus Benedict Torvalds <torvalds@cc.helsinki.fi>
To: Linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

Ok, I have uploaded the rest of the linux distribution to nic.funet.fi.
They aren't visible yet, but I guess they'll show up tomorrow or so.

The new files are:

 - fileutil.tar.Z, which contains most of the GNU fileutils. It's not
   the latest release, so if you want that, you'll have to compile it
   for linux.  No source changes, but a lot of -DSTPCPY_MISSING etc in
   the makefiles. 

 - hd.c. I have gotten one problem report already about hd-handling in
   0.12.  This is a correction to kernel/blk_drv/hd.c, and should
   hopefully correct the problem.  There was also a problem with a
   second harddisk not working although the first one did: I think I
   found the problem, and fixed it.  If you cannot get linux operating
   at all (but the bug wasn't that severe, I think), and are thus unable
   to recompile it, mail me. 

 - include.tar.Z. Yes. Yet another include.tar.Z. I don't save old
   versions, so I don't do cdiffs :(.  I still expect patches to be
   cdiffs.  Bastard, ain't I?

 - lib.tar.Z.  The library sources. 

 - libc.a.Z.  Compiled libc.a

 - mkswap.  This should have been on the root-diskette, but was
   forgotten. See description in RELNOTES.

 - system.tar.Z.  The latest sources to the system files: mkswap, mkfs,
   fsck and fdisk.

 - utils.tar.Z.  Contains a new tar (you can use the old one to untar
   this, but this should understand about symbolic links etc), make,
   uemacs and some minor programs (sed and basename I think).

The old utilbin.tar.Z file should be replaced by 'fileutil' and 'utils'. 
The old include.tar.Z, libc.a library.tar.Z should be replaces by their
newer versions. The old uemacs.Z, bash.Z can also be removed from the
archives.

There is some overlapping between these files and the root-diskette (and
older versions of linux).

	And over to other things:

Someone asked on comp.os.minix how to move non-tar files to a linux
partition: the INSTALL-0.11 told about tar-files, but not about things
like libc.a. The easiest answer is to tar the single file into a
tar-file, and then the problem is reduced to something we can handle.

Another possibility is to use the mtools package, but there were so many
questions about it the last time that I'm not even going to mention it
this time around. 

A third possibility is to just write the file to a floppy using
rawrite.exe or NU or something, and then reading the floppy and
truncating at the filelength. This means you have to remember how long
the file was. Truncation can be done by 'dd' or by 'head -c'.

	And one warning...

There are easy ways to make fsck report errors on your harddisk that
were introduced with the demand-loading in 0.11. It's not a bug, but I
thought I'd warn everyone:

While a program is running, it's inode is marked in use.  Thus if you
delete a running command, it seems to be gone, but the file is still
there (standard unix practice).  Sync a thousand times, and the file
will still not be really deleted until the inode no longer is in use:
This may not happen if the file was /bin/update or /bin/sh.

The result is that if you reboot with a deleted file in use, fsck will
wanr about a lot of unused blocks that are marked in use. No problem,
'fsck -a' repairs it, and it /really/ isn't a bug, it's just that we
haven't got something like shutdown yet that sees to these kinds of
problems.

   work, obviously, because it requires a raw disk device instead of a block

No, you can just use the block disk device.  It's already been ported to
Linux, however.  (although it's pretty easy to port)

Subject: console problems
Date: Wed, 15 Jan 92 11:43:06 PST
From: pmacdona@sanjuan.UVic.CA (Peter MacDonald)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi


There are a few small anoyances in the console patches for VC.  
All in all, .12 is an amazing leap over .11.  

First, to the termcap, you should add to your termcap entry,

  :rs=\Ec:

This defines the reset string.  Otherwise, window sizes etc hang around.
It seems some systems define \E> instead of \Ec, but this according
to DEC (who created vt100)  is to reset to application keypad.  So
console uses \Ec.  Argg.

Second, autodectection correctly identifies my ATI card, but only supports
132 line mode, which my monitor (and preferences) don't.  So, anyone know
the correc mode to use?  The old code I have has to use int 10 twice, once
to set the mode and once to set the font.  Also a termcap entry for 50 line mode
needs to be added.

Screen dumping isn't working cause the handler in tty_ioctl.c didn't make
make it through Linus's vicous editing.   Screen blanking ditto.

I note that when at the bottom of the screen now, hitting enter causes 
an unpleasant jitter on the screen, in VC.  This is probably as
a result of using Video memory.  I plan on posting a patch (as soon
as I get time) that will let you use ram buffers instead of video
ram, as a conditional compile.  It turns out that when X shows up,
we will need buffers to store video contents in anyways, but ...

The problem is that the screen size can be determined dynamically 
at boot time.  This is nice, but I think a conditional compile
should be added to setup.S to allow the individual to select a
screen dimension as the default, either with a timeout upon 
selection, or with just a hardcoded one videomode.  ie

#define  DEFAULT_VIDEO_MODE ati3
#ifdef DEFAULT_VIDEO_MODE ati3
  use ati3 as default
#else
  use detection, (maybe default to 80x25 if timeout)
#endif

The other problem with my old console.c was that the buffer size had
to be hard coded.  This was tough to do when the screen dimensions
could vary dynamically.  My new approach will be: 

/*#define RAM_BUFFER_SIZE (MAX_CONSOLES*MAX_COLS*MAX_ROWS)*/

#ifdef RAM_BUFFER_SIZE
static short vc_video_buf[RAM_BUFFER_SIZE];
#endif 

This will allow each individual to either specify exactly how much
precious kernel memory they want to give up or, how many consoles
they desire of whic maximum dimensions,  all without modifying code.
  
This will also allow VC to work with non EGA/VGA, not a problem
for me, but no good reason to exclude them.

It will also allow screen blanking to work on all systems, again.

None of this should be too tough, since Linus has already done all the 
knotty work of dividing up a single big buffer.  And when 
X (or MGR) comes, coexistance should be easy.

Finally, setterm.c will be changed to no longer consult your terminal
type.  Else, you will note that con132x44 does not allow setterm to
do anything.  

Sorry about all this mess, but due to my situation (sob, sob), I 
don't have all that much time to devote to Linux.  Most of the
stuff I submitted to Linus was, shall we say, half baked, but
well intentioned.  But I am ecstatic to play any part in it.
In fact, it looks like Linus and I, between us, have managed
to pound out a design for shared libraries that is excruciatingly
simple to implement.  That is what I will be working on next,
(unless Linus beets me to the punch).

Subject: policy for accepting patches to 0.12
Date: Wed, 15 Jan 1992 22:09:37 +0200
From: Linus Benedict Torvalds <torvalds@cc.helsinki.fi>
To: Linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

Ok, I forgot to mention this in my last post, but I'm afraid I'll have
to warn all of you that want to implement a new feature: I will not
accept big non-localized patches to 0.12.  This doesn't mean you cannot
implement something neat, but it does mean that it probably won't be in
0.13 unless it's so neat I cannot live without it. 

There are good reasons for this: I'll have to do some studuing that I
missed the last semester due to working on linux, and the courses start
tomorrow.  That was one of the reasons for the fixed release-date of the
current version. 

Also, VFS support (which is missing in 0.12, although there were
alpha-patches for it) will probably be implemented for 0.13, and I need
a relatively clean kernel for that: as pmacdona found out, the patches
that get in put after other patches have to be extensively edited to
fit.

This does NOT mean that I won't accept bug-reports and patches.  Also,
it doesn't mean I won't accept the init/login package: I assume that
won't touch the kernel very much.  I hope this won't be a big problem:
most of the things people wanted are in 0.12.  And with VFS we'll
eventually get the longer filenames that was also high on the list of
wanted things.

If it hasn't been lost, you might want to write the low level interface part
of what i'm working on - I've got disk and tape drivers on the way that are
independant of the SCSI host and low level software.  The final (I think)
revision of the interface hosts.h and scsi.h files were posted to the

I'm having a problem booting the new Linux 0.12 bootimage disk.  
I downloaded it, uncompressed and wrote it to a 1.44MB disk with RaWrite.
Unfortunately, when I boot, I get this:

(some IBM graphics character)
Loa

And the system halts.  I don't know what's wrong since Linux-0.11 worked fine.
Does this have something to do with the graphics card detection?  I have
an ET4000-based SVGA card, if that matters.   Any suggestions?

No, that's the problem... It starts to say "Loading..."
but only gets to "Loa" when it freezes.  
At first I thought it was a bad download but I went and downloaded
the file again, compared the file size to the original but it still
won't work.
So basically I get a single graphics character (same one every time)
and "Loa" and that's it.

Your binary is corrupt - Loading is printed in a single int 10h call, so at 
least that much should be printed.  The graphics character and hang would 
indicate the boot sector had been corrupted.  You might examine it with
debug or NU and look at the Loading message, etc, and compare a disassembly
to the source.


probably isn't getting to the first int 13h call.

Maybe not :-).

I've just got round to installing linux on my hard disk, after being 
suitably impressed with the 0.11 bootable images.  I've today ordered
a second disk so until that arrives I'm sorry that I won't be doing any
programing.

A couple of points:

In the INSTALL documents it asks you to (in a for loop):
cp -r /dev /user
Not surprisingly this hangs as cp trys to read the devices and doesn't cp
special devices (well it didn't for me!). Can I suggest the documentation
changes to:

uncompress < /usr/bin/tar.Z > /user/tar
/user/tar xf - bin dev etc usr tmp | (cd /user ; tar xfv -)

which will copy the /dev entries.

Also has anyone got the -M (multivolumes) to work? I get EIO at the end
of disk and never asked for the next volume.

Thanks for a fun time.

Jon.

I've used both, Minix386 about 6months ago, Linux for the last month.
Linux is a lot faster I feel, and ports better according to people on 
the mailing list.  It is compiled with gcc, and feels pretty stable
and solid.  I would suggest you give it a go for a couple of days
and see how you like it.

Then Linus is a f**king code poet.  I don't know how long he's been
working on it, but if it's been "months" I'd be *super* impressed!
Right now I'm just real impressed..  :-)  
Seriously though there have been quite a few contributions from other
net.code.poets to Linux so it's not like it was a total one man effort,
though Linus seems to have done most the core operating system stuff.
I'd suggest you send a note to "linux-activists-request@joker.cs.hut.fi"
and ask to be put on the mailing list if you're real interested or that
you just download linux itself and play with it or read some of the release
notes and/or code if you're just mildly intrigued.  I don't have a lot
of time to dedicate to development (ok, none really) but I *really* like
the idea of a free, evolving (rapidly) UNIX clone that isn't "owned" by
a big company like Prentice-Hall and has all the hassles (and costs) that
come along with commercialization.  It's Linus' system but because it's
free (except for your net connections) I think it has the potential to
become a popular, well supported (ports) system..

(ok, I got carried away..basic thought: I like it!)

first do: doshell /dev/tty2 sh &

Then switch to tty2 (Left ALT - F2) and bingo! Shell prompt. This is
real neat.

By the way, in case any of you were wondering, your serial ports are now
on /dev/tty64 and /dev/tty65.

They're there now.  My apologies for the delay.  First it took a while
because I couldn't log into nic.funet.fi (because too foreign users were
logged in), and then I was away at a wine tasting class (we did white
wines tonight; yum!  :-)

Also, someone (qpliu@phoenix.prinnceton.edu from the source files) has
uploaded to TSX-11 a quick and dirty implementation of init/login.  I've
placed it in ~ftp/pub/linux/sources/sbin on TSX-11, and I've also
forwarded a copy to nic.funet.fi.  It looks pretty minimal and
bare-bones (it doesn't appear to support run levels), but it appears to
be functional.

Perhaps this and the other init development efforts can be merged
together, with the best code being taken from each.

The README file for the qpl init/login follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------
Although there are other people working on init/getty/login,
I couldn't wait.  Being dumped into root is not so nice.

There is no getty here.  I put /bin/login in the getty field of /etc/ttytab.

What is here:
	a patch to init/main.c that makes it exec /etc/init.
	init.c
	getttyent.c
	getttynam.c
	ttyent.h (from BSD)
	login.c

init.c:
	written based on sunos init(8) manpage.  differences are
	that the -sb switches are ignored, the window="command" in
	/etc/ttytab is ignored, runs only /etc/rc and ignores
	the result code, utmp and wtmp are not updated, SIGTERM
	is ignored, does not create /etc/ttys, and any
	undiscovered bugs.
	since the manpage doesn't say how the getty entry in
	/etc/ttytab is parsed, using strtok seems reasonable.
	works for /dev/tty0 in 0.11.  should be able to hang
	terminals off the serial ports, but i can't test it
	without terminals or cables.

getttyent.c, getttynam.c, ttyent.h:
	functions to read /etc/ttytab.

login.c:
	does the basic login stuff.  accepts and ignores -p switch.
	uses stuff in getttyent.o and getttynam.o to set TERM.
	makes a better filler in /etc/ttytab than /bin/sh, making
	it easier to avoid being root.

Subject: Use PERL rather than C for system commands?
From: tim@pokey.cs.caltech.edu (Timothy L. Kay)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi
Date: Wed, 15 Jan 92 22:08:25 -0800


I've been following the Linux discussion with great interest, and I
hope to download a copy and try it as soon as I have time.

I'd like to make a suggestion to the activists group.  The suggestion
goes against the grain of typical Unix system administrator
philosophy, but I think the suggestion warrants serious consideration.

Here is my suggestion.

It seems to me that the language PERL is ideal for implementing many
of the pieces that are currently missing from Linux.  For example,
init, getty, login, shutdown, halt, cron, inetd, etc. could very
easily be written in PERL rather than C.  Most OS-support programs
(including the ones mentioned previously) are not time critical.  They
run very infrequently, and the performance degradation (if there is
any) should be inconsequential.

There are several advantages to using PERL rather than C.

First of all, programs would take up much less disk space and RAM.  It
is true that the PERL executable must be in RAM in order to run a PERL
program, but only one copy ever need be in RAM at any time, and I
think the savings elsewhere will more than make up the difference.
(On my workstation, the PERL .text section is about 4 times as large
as the login .text section.  If perhaps four or five memory-resident
programs are replaced by PERL scripts, the break-even point is
reached.)  Also, if the PERL executable is always resident, then
loading PERL programs from disk should require very little time.

A more obvious advantage is that writing PERL programs is much less
time-consuming that writing C programs.  This is due to the fact that
the compile step gets skipped, and because PERL has a built-in
debugger.

Third, I find PERL a *much* better script language than either sh or
csh.

Additionally, PERL contains special support to aid in writing secure
programs.  It is easier to write secure SUID programs in PERL than it
is in C.

Finally, PERL scripts are architecture-independent.  If Linux ever
gets ported to multiple architectures (which I am guessing it will),
all support programs written in PERL port with no effort at all.

There are several disadvantages to using PERL.

First of all, PERL must be ported to Linux.  Of course, PERL should be
ported to Linux whether or not my suggestion is adopted.

PERL is a very *expert* friendly language.  Learning to program in
PERL involves a steep learning curve.  It takes quite a bit of
practice to become proficient at writing in PERL.  I believe the
effort is well spent.

If your SVGA chipset is supported, you get a prompt to choose a screen
mode, or continue for normal EGA operation.

I am a little opposed to using PERL for development.
Because.

   We already are using C for most things.
   Sh script has to be there because bash is.
   Everyone would have to become experts in a third language.

I mean, as far as I am concerned, I'am a little peaved that sh isn't
more like C.  Going to PERL will take us even further from the KISS
principle.  And..

Shared libraries are coming, so executables will be getting smaller, 
and the break even point for PERL will be increased.

Don't get me wrong, DO port PERL.  But sell the farm...

    It seems to me that the language PERL is ideal for implementing many
    of the pieces that are currently missing from Linux.  For example,
    init, getty, login, shutdown, halt, cron, inetd, etc. could very
    easily be written in PERL rather than C.  Most OS-support programs
    (including the ones mentioned previously) are not time critical.  They
    run very infrequently, and the performance degradation (if there is
    any) should be inconsequential.

Can't do standard library calls in perl :( - 
init, shutdown are definates 
getty - maybe                   
cron - probably want to use alarms for the next event, so no
inetd - we want to use listen, so no


    Third, I find PERL a *much* better script language than either sh or
    csh.

Agreed!  Let's get perl for Linux.

    Finally, PERL scripts are architecture-independent.  If Linux ever
    gets ported to multiple architectures (which I am guessing it will),
    all support programs written in PERL port with no effort at all.

Non-issue : any of the programs mentioned above, halt excepted (If we
are to code in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled) will go
no deeper than mayuking system calls.

I have been writing about my ESDI disk every now and then. Now it
SEEMS to work OK, but be warned: if I get any read errors, the system
just hangs, doesn't even boot with ctrl-alt-del. Also I had to remove
the printk statement in hd.c that puts "unexpected hd interrupt" on
the screen, because I was getting so many of those messages that
sometimes I couldn't see anything else on the screen. Luckily I had
other drives to compile a new system.

I am going to try fixing the driver so that the interrupt gets handled
as it should, but it might take some time as I'm not experienced
systems programmer. Anyway, the hd driver LOOKS simple enough for me
to try. But first I have to find some info on the ESDI controller, so
I'll know what it wants.

In the meantime, you should be able to use ESDI drives, if you can
live with these nuisances.

    Hi linux specialists,

    i've downloaded the linux software yesterday and tried to create the boot d
   isk. I write the bootimage to a 360k and 1.2M disk with rawrite and used bot
   h as bootdisk. In both cases i got the following output on my screen:

Currently, unless you patch the boot image, Linux will not boot off of a 
360K disk in a 1.2M drive.  Messy-Loss hard codes the number of sectors
into the boot image, where as Linux finds the number from the BIOS. 
 Problem is that the BIOS returns the MAXIMUM capacity of the drive, not 
what the current disk has on it.

As far as the 1.2, the error dump shows that it was probably formatted 
as a 360K disk.

This is the error dump code, working perfectly in the MASM version of the 
source, binged by me on the translation back to Unix assembler 
(Perl script was one way.)


I should probably explain it :

The loading prompy prints one '.' for each track read, before it is read.
The Loading. means a read was attempted on the first track 

    Loading.
    
I left off a conditional jump in the translation to Bruce's assembler 
syntax, so a register was printed where it should have been,
but the first hex number is the return code (from AX) of the failed 
int 0x13.  

ah = error code, 4, I believe sector not found?
al = sectors successfully read.


    @X:0404

After that, the registers as they were on entry to the int 0x13 call are
printed so we know exactly what is going on.


    AX:020A
    000
    CX:0006
    DX:0000.
AH = 2 read
AL = sectors requested 
bx = address
CL is the starting sector, 6
CH is the track
DH is the head
DL is the disk

This means that the read of ten sectors, starting at sector 6 head 0
disk 0 cylinder 0 failed after successfully reading four sectors starting at
sector 6.  Means sector 10 was not found, 9 sector diskette,
or perhaps CMOS setup wrong.

Try reformatting a disk with format a: /n:15 /t:80 and rawrite to that.
 
CMOS setting of the floppy.


 
    @X:0404 
    AX:020A

K  eeps retrying.


    and so on. What is my problem? Is the bootimage corrupted, or is my machine
    not able to hanlde linux (386SX 16MHz)?

    Thanks for your help

    Karl Heinz

Floppy disk problem, no more.
--------

Well, I'll fix the cosmetics of the error dump, and can also fix it so that
 if a sector is 
not found, it changes sector count to that, so it can adjust itself to
9 sector disks.  Any other sugestions?

I am new to Linux (I've installed 0.12 and used it for less than 2 hours).
It looks great!

So far I've found one problem: uncompress can do weird things.
This is what I did:
 cd /
 mkdir test
 cp bin/* test
 cd test
 compress *
 uncompress *

What everything seemed fine up to and through the compress. But 
uncompress * resulted in some of the files uncompressing fine and
others not. The ones that didn't typically left the .Z file and a
corresponding non .Z file (that was bad - like 0 bytes).

If I did an uncompress on each file individually by name (rather than
using the wildcard *) all is fine.

Is it the fault of uncompress, or the wildcard *, or am I doing something
stupid?

System hardware is Mylex 386SX-16 motherboard with 7.5 MB of RAM, an Everex
EV332 ST506/MFM disk controller, and a Seagate ST251 40 meg disk.
When I try to boot 0.11, I get an error message complaining that the hard
disk controller reset got a return code of D2 or D0, and a kernel panic.
This happens no matter whether I boot up from power off, from the front

Is my hardware flaky? Is my hardware even supported? How do I go about

Timothy Cullip: "Uncompress corrupting files" (Jan 16, 10:05):
>  uncompress *

Ok, this has come up before. The bug is (I'm told) in the
estdio/compress pair: either compress does something it shouldn't really
do, or estdio has a subtle bug that shows up /only/ with compress, but
the fact is that [un]compress doesn't like several arguments. There
should be a fix for this (a patch to estdio), but I have never seen it.
Do the uncompresses one by one (or in a for-loop), and things are well.

Someone:
> kermit on 0.12 doesn't work.

Yet another thing I forgot to say about the new release: the device
numbers for tty's have changed: tty0 is now a "general console" - it
always uses the current console to read/write things (current at the
time of the system call), tty1-63 are reserved for virtual consoles,
tty64-127 are reserved for serial io (possibly line printer: how about
making it a tty-device?) and tty128- are reserved for pty's.

The com1 is now called /dev/tty64, and com2 is called /dev/tty65. Users
of the alpha vc package for 0.11 will recognize this numbering. Hope
this was the only problem.

Yet someone else:
> Cannot find mkswap & include.tar.Z

mkswap was intended to be on the root disk, but I forgot it: it can be
found at least on nic: /pub/OS/Linux/bin/mkswap. include.tar.Z is in the
kernel subdir. I think the other sites have them too - search for them
from the closest site first.

There's also a problem where if you control-C a "zcat filename", it will

I suspect at least some of the problems is that we're using an old

have these patches applied. Maybe that's what causes the uncompress
problem?

I noticed another bug in estdio/fread.c. It does not set the _IOEOF flag
when hitting EOF during an __ioread() call.

The diff below fixes it and included the previously known bug with
readsize. I don't know if this fix catches all situations, it works for
me.

I got 0.11 to work by turning off turbo mode. The 0.12 version works at
full speed, with no complaints. (Thanks Linus!)

I'm new to linux and am, of course, filled with burning questions.
I've been playing with the floppy versions and am all excited about
installing it on a hard drive.  I have noticed, however, that 0.12
seems to be lacking /dev/hd8 and /dev/hd9.  Does this mean that I
will have trouble installing it on a 2nd (hd5) hard drive? Should
I swap hard drive positions to avoid it?  I imagine that once I'm
up with sources & a compiler I can get everything straightened out.

I'm reasonably proficient in C/C++ but have only a user's knowledge
of Unix.  Can anyone suggest a good reference to get me started
on the real guts of unix architecture, administrative details, etc?

Thanks.

I recently submitted a message suggesting that Linux use PERL as the
implementation lanugage for many of its system support programs.  The
follow-ups indicated that people aren't familiar with the abilities of
PERL.  To address specific points mentioned in the followup, PERL does
give access to essentially all of the Unix system calls, including
alarm() and listen().  There is no technical reason why PERL couldn't
be used; it is simply a question of whether people think the
philosophical change is justified by the advantages gained.

From: pmacdona@sanjuan.UVic.CA (Peter MacDonald)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi


Beware, that the shoelace patches I posted overwrite the byte at offset
that is used for the swap device.   That is because I tried to get
clever and put the "rootdev" in that is in the shoelace config file
and put it where Linux expects it, ie offset 508.   It never worked,
but I never took it out of the code in shoe.c.   Somehow,
it ends up at 506, where the swapdev is now stored!

So guess when I found this out, go on, take a guess.  

You got it, right after I blew away my minix partition, to create
a swap partition.  So I can't recompile shoelace without reinstalling
minix.   I don't have the diskspace for this.

If someone out there has installed my shoelace patches, and has minix,
can you change the 508, to 510 in shoe.c at around line 548, and recompile.  
Then maybe upload the executable to nic?  And maybe let me know?

Also, there is a problem with special characters in console.c now.
Even reset doesn't clear it.  When I figure it out, I will post
it as part of my console patch for blanking, dumping et al.
I don't want to repeat the slew of patches I put out in .11.

Peter.

Argghh. Yet another root-diskette bug. This one is simple to rectify:
make the new devices with;

# mknod /dev/hd8 b 3 8
# mknod /dev/hd9 b 3 9

and all should be well. I don't have hd8 and hd9, and used just a "cp

The technical abilities of PERL are not being questioned.  But using PERL 
would greatly complicate matters, when there is no storage benefit and a
performance degradation.  (Before you reply that PERL is interpretted, or
interpiled, remember that very soon Linux will have shared libraries, and I
believe Linux already has shared and sticky binaries.)

First, thanks for replying, I wasn't sure whether this got though.

The differences involve:

Key '2' has a '"' when shifted;
Key '3' Has a pound sign, nort a hash;
The ' and " key is pound sign and '@';
and there are some other odd keys, noticeably the fact that the 
backslash and backquote characters have moved by miles.
I have an American keyboard, but it's twice as heavy as the 
British one that I uae, and since I go by key symbols when
typing (professional typing, eh? 8-) it gets on my nerves.

Hello Activists!


I am unable to compile with gcc, (on Linux 0.12, 2meg ram, 386-sx, AMI bios).

When I type gcc filename, I get:
gcc: installation problem, cannot exec cpp: Exec format error

I think I just don't have the correct things in the correct places, so:
1) Where does gcc (and accompanying files) go?  /usr/gnu/bin?
2) Where do libc.a & libreadline.a go?
3) Where do I put the files in lib.tar.Z
4) Where do I put the include files, include.tar?
5) Is there anything else I need, and where should I put it?

I appologize if these questions are FAQ, if so could someone point me
to the FAQ?

   TCP/IP and Sockets are more than I have time to tackle, but I might be 
able to point you to some Code and docs.  Try FTPing to zaphod.ncsa.uiuc.edu
[141.142.20.50].  They have a PD (or at least freely distributed) telnet
program for MS-DOS with drivers for LOTS of ethernet boards.  The source
code for all the drivers is in one BIG .zip file.  If you could base your
low-level drivers on this code it would probably make it easier to port to
other boards. 

  Hope this helps

      TCP/IP and Sockets are more than I have time to tackle, but I might be 
   able to point you to some Code and docs.  Try FTPing to zaphod.ncsa.uiuc.edu
   [141.142.20.50].  They have a PD (or at least freely distributed) telnet
   program for MS-DOS with drivers for LOTS of ethernet boards.  The source
   code for all the drivers is in one BIG .zip file.  If you could base your
   low-level drivers on this code it would probably make it easier to port to
   other boards. 

If this is the Clarson packet driver stuff, be aware that the code
assumes you are running in 16 bit real mode.  It may be non-trivial to
port them so that they work in a 32-bit protected mode.  You may want to
look at them and form your own opinion.

Whether or not you use the MS-LOSS packet drivers, it would be a very
good idea to have a well-defined abstraction boundary between the
Networking/IP layer and the Ethernet driver layer.  Then you can publish
the interface early on, and people can write their own drivers for their
ethernet cards with a minimum of pain.

Lawrence, I assume that you will be using the BSD networking release as
a base?

Ok, this comes up every once in a while, and I agree a FAQ would be a
good idea. We had one, but it got out-of-date even before it was ready:
linux has evolved rather quickly. Just as a pointer, there are
linux-activists mail collected at tsx-11 (or was some time ago), and
people new on the list might want to know what the problems of
yesterweek have been.

Gcc can install in several directories, but the following is what I use:

from gccbin.tar:

/usr/local/bin - gcc
/usr/local/lib - all the other stuff

/usr/local/bin needs to be in the path (as an aside: bash-1.11 has a bug
which results in an abort() if your path ends in a colon, and you try to
execute something that doesn't exists: eg xyzzy). 

include.tar.Z should untar to the /usr/include -directory tree if you
untar it in the root directory. Check with "tar tf include.tar".

lib.tar.Z doesn't need to go in any special place: I have a source tree
under /usr/src, and I put it under that. You don't need this file unless
you want to recompile the library.

Additionally, I've linked (use symbolic links if you wish, testing out
new features) gcc to just 'cc', as that means I sometimes don't have to
change the makefiles at all.  Likewise, gcc-ld, gcc-as, gcc-ar can with
success be linked to the files 'gld', 'gas' and 'gar', somewhere on the
path.  I have all the /usr/local/lib/gcc-XX files linked both to
/usr/local/bin/XX and /usr/local/bin/gXX.

There are at least a couple of free implementations of TCP/IP,
though I don't know about sockets.  One was written by Russ Nelson
and is GNU-copylefted, but I don't know what functionality it
includes.  I believe it is ftpable from grape.soe.clarkson.edu.
The other was written by Phil Karn KA9Q and includes pretty
much everything, but I'm not sure of the exact distribution
permissions.  It's called the KA9Q TCP package.  I'm not sure
where to ftp a copy but "archie" should be able to find it,
or I could ask someone.  Having no network hardware I haven't
really looked into either of these.  I believe there was also
a free package written at MIT that was the basis for FTP Software's
implementation but I don't know more details.

105M Priam RLL drive, which has >1024 cylinders, hence I have a DTC 7287

Here's the problem:
I boot & get the Loading..., then '*MDA' goes in the upper-right corner
of the screen, then '2 Virtual Consoles' & '4 pty's' then (argh)
'Kernel Panic: HD Controller not ready'.

Sometimes I don't get past the Loading..., sometimes I get to the
panic.

Any clues?

elvis, compiled with the SYSV options works fine, also can emulate ex,

From: pmacdona@sanjuan.UVic.CA (Peter MacDonald)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi


I have all of the features of VC working again, including
screen blanking, screen dumping and using memory buffers so
more consoles than your single page of video memory will allow
can be used.  These buffers use kernel memory, but would have
been required when a windowing system comes along anyways.
The unpleasant juddering of the screen when scrolling is also
eliminated.  Does anyone else see this or is it just me?
Also, terminal reset is fixed.  It wasn't resetting back from
graphics char mode.  Finally, I got rid of the check in 
setterm.c for the terminal type.  But since setterm wasn't 
distributed with .12, it won't affect to many people.

I will probably not release it for a few more days, so I can 
test it some more, and figure out whats going on with 
vt100 graphics chars, but if you are desperate to alpha test,
drop me a note.  The patches are not too extensive, and the
main goal was to disturb .12 as little as possible.

I have also written a poor persons version of ps.  Actually,
it is more like a skeleton.  But it correctly gets info from
the kernel, and runs as a standalone program rather than being.  
driven by function keys. 

However, it should be made to look more like what
people are used to.  If someone wants to volunteer to take
it and extend it to have all the nice options, let me know.
I think ps is one of those very system specific functions that
we can not pull in from GNU.  But, if you have an idea of
what it should be modelled after (Sun?) speak up now.

I am announcing all this so hopefully, duplication is avoided.

Has anyone else had trouble with virtual consoles on monocrome cards? I
downloaded the new version and it worked fine on a system with CGA or EGA but
doesn't work on my monocrome system. When you try to change to another console
the cursor goes away but the screen doesn't change, also typed input goes
someplace else (I assume to the other console). Playing with this for a while
made the system spontaneosly reboot.
I'm not sure if this is a software problem or just incompatible hardware.

From: brtmac@maverick.ksu.ksu.edu (Brett McCoy)
To: linux-activists@joker.cs.hut.fi

I just got linux-0.12 up and running on a machine here at work tonight.
Works great except for one problem, I keep getting these kernel panic's
and messages that say 'trying to free free page'.  I don't have any of
the other information that it printed out right now but if anyone would
like it I'm sure I can get it without much problem and send it to them.

I have a sneaking suspicion that the particular hardware setup I have is
partially the cause for the crashes: 20Mhz 386sx, 85M 3.5 drive with a
15M partition for root and a 6M partition for swap, VGA (although the
VC stuff doesn't recognize any of the VGA text modes, EGA 80x24 only :( )
and 1 (that's right folks, ONE) Meg of memory.  I have a feeling that the
amount of paging and swapping that it is having to do is overworking some
portion of the kernel and is exercising a bug pretty rigirously, but hey,
what better test?

I am amazed at how well it runs even with only 1M of physical memory.  Now
for a question, is there any way I can decrease the default number of disk
buffers from 405 to something more reasonable like 100 or 200 so that there
is a bit more free memory for programs (380k or so is a little tight).  I
can deal with a little bit decreased disk I/O performance due to the increase
in buffer cache misses.

Well, that's in for now folks.

I am not working on it, in fact i haven't managed to get Linux running yet. But
i will need something like sockets to get X running.

The WD8003E from Western Digital would be nice to start with because it cheap
(about $200). The source of a device driver should be somewhere on the
sun.soe.clarkson.edu site and i think i also have it somewhere.

PS. Are there any brave guys out there who want to help porting X-Windows to
    Linux? I think it is a bit big for one person to do it. (X11R4 is about
    150Mb and X11R5 i even don't dare thinking about). But first i want to
    figure out what i needed for this port.

I got this really wierd error from GCC yesterday while trying to
compile the GNU textutils package v1.1 (I know its already been done
but I don't trust anything unless I've compiled it myself). The
particular error occurred when compiling the file lib/regex.c using
the command

gcc -O -I. -I../lib -DSTDC_HEADERS -DPOSIX -DUSG -c regex.c (I think)

the error was something like 'unrecognised insn at line 5285'
followed by a short listing of GCC intermediate code which I havn't
written down. It only occurred when optimization was turned on.

I believe the problem is caused by the include file 'string.h' which
defines all the string operations as inline assembly code (as the
error only happened when this file was included) and in particular
the 'strlen' function (as this is at line 5285 in the source).
Unfortunately I was unable to repeat the error on a smaller test
file but the error was completely repeatable on the regex.c file. 

Is this a bug in GCC? Can anyone help?

What you need to know about an ethernet card IS contained in a packet driver;
which is, after all, fairly low level.  You need to know what port to
stuff commands in, how to set up interrupts, where to get data out of it,
and not much more.  Most of the stuff will be congruent -- in fact, if
linux provides any support for setting up interrupts and DMA transfers, the
drivers will be simpler than the clarkson drivers.

Hi,

About X11: Try ftping to  131.159.8.35
It features an 386 port of X11.
The neat thing about it: it takes only 18MB, and features
some SVGA cards.
The stuff runs using SCO UNIX... the big question: will Linux
do as well?

About the binaries: let's get some more of them :-)
Surely binaries of vi and the like are sheer nescesities.
My attempt to compile elvis failed, but that was probably
due to using old include files.

	Long live Linux,

The KA9Q NOS TCP/IP package is available in several flavors for anonymous
FTP from ucsd.edu; look in the hamradio/tcpip/nos directory. It is licensed
for amateur and non-profit educational use.

NOS is probably going to be a lot of work to port to a native Linux
environment, as it is a monolithic program with its own built-in
multitasker and user support system...some work has been done in that area,
but it's a pain. Different folks' efforts can be found on ucsd.edu as well.

I'm looking into it.  I suspect implementing the ptrace system call will be
the hardest part.  If anyone with kernel experience (any would be more than
me :-) wants to tackle ptrace, let me know and I'll concentrate on compiling
gdb.  Also, does anybody with access to gcc 2 know of any changes from 1.4
that might affect porting gdb 4.3 to Linux?

BTW, does anyone know how to patch the keyboard driver to increase the repeat
rate?  I like a fast keyboard and the default repeat rate is driving me nuts.

Hmm....  I think we really need a FAQ soon..... a lot of new people have

been discussed on this mailing list.  Which is fine, since they don't
know that, but it may be frustrating to people who are already on the
list.  Is someone willing to volunteer putting together a FAQ and
posting it every month or so, along with diff's of the previous month's
FAQ sheet? 

To all you newcomers --- Welcome!  If you have the time, you may wish to
look at the mailing list archives, which can be found on TSX-11.MIT.EDU.
It's in ~ftp/pub/linux/mail-archives, and I have archived everything on
the Linux-Activsts mailing list since November, 1991 (during the time of
Linux 0.10).  You may find that many of your questions are ones which

The version of virtual consoles included with Linux 0.12 does indeed not
work with MGA cards.  This is because it attempts to use the CGA video
memory.  I believe Peter MacDonalnd (pmacdona@sanjuan.uvic.ca), who
wrote the original VC code, has patches to change the VC code back to
using buffer memory instead of video memory.

It's a bug in the machine description file included with the distributed
binary of GCC.  Linus added some instruction patters so that it could
take advantage of the string instructions, and they didn't work out
completely right.  The way to fix it (for now) is to just compile that
module without optimization (-O).  When a new version of GCC binary is
posted, hopefully the MD file can be made smart enough so that these
errors won't happen.

It will probably be quite useful in bringing X to Linux, but first we
need to get minor little details like BSD Networking and Sockets to
Linux...  A previous message sent out to mailing list (look in the
