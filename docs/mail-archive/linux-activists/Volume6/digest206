I'm sorry, but I just don't see what is so great about NeXT or NeXTStep.  I
know the answer that Jobs and company give, but let's get beyond the pretty
icons and the hype.

It's deadly slow on a NeXT itself.  It requires a 486/66 with eisa, 16 meg ram,
and 2 meg on the video card to run half-way decent monochrome graphics.  With
linux on a box like that, it'd be incredibly fast.  While I have not seen the
Intel port in action, whaddya bet it's terribly slow on even that setup?

If you want software beyond what comes with it?  Let's say we get tired of
the dictionary, and ObjectBuilder.  What else is there?  From the ifdef NEXT
stuff you see in  c programs, it seems that it's a pain in the &*^) to write
for, compared to most unices.  What is available?  No X11 stuff will be 
easy to port -- it'll have to be completely re-written.

There isn't that much commercial software out there for it, and what there is
is very expensive.

I can't see any future for this product, not at the price, seeing the 
limitations of such a small user base and incompatible OS.  It seems like
NeXT's last gasp.

That and its $1000 entry cost is enough to choke most users.

personally i prefer

Actually, I recently discovered by reading one of the Linux FAQs that 
Linux's Net-2 simply means "the second release of the Linux networking
code" and has nothing to do with Berkeley's Net/2 (which I originally
thought it was).

It took me less than an hour to setup the networking on my NeXT.  I 
can now log into it from my Macintosh with NCSA Telnet.  On my linux box
I've been trying to get the thing to even recognize my host's name and 
the ethernet card for about 2 weeks.

About 80-90% on (supposedly) of the Video speed.

There are several ports of X to the NeXT:  2 Public domain (MouseX, and
one
by Tufts University).  There are at least 2 commercial versions, that 
support Motiff, available (Pencom's Co-Xist, and eXedous).

True, but the same can be said for almost all unices.

Date: Mon,  6 Sep 1993 10:32:04 -0400

Do anyone have the successful case with this configuration, in
Linux/Dos? I setup the SCSI id to be 2, and the terminator is installed
at both end (one is Adaptec 1540B, another is Teac CD-50 CDROM-driver,
and it's the only SCSI driver I have now)
 
Both dos and linux can recognize the CDROM driver at properly ID and
CUN(0), but I just can't find the data of the CD-ROM. I use the
ASP4DOS.sys from adaptec and Corel SCSI driver on the DOS part, and it
works fine before I tried to use it. I even can't reject the disc by
using the reject buttom.
 
Since I am new to both sides: SCSI card and CDROM, I wonder is it the
problem of driver(CDROM), or the problem of Adaptec 1540B?
 
Any help is appreciated

   Actually, I saw it in action on a '486 about a month ago at the office of
a Next developer.  It was most definately faster on the '486 - Gateway,
by the way.  ( I couldn't tell you what speed, though I suspect it was
a 33MHZ machine. )

   As for software availability, the developer showed me a number of
PD/Shareware apps that rivaled the work of most MS-DOS/BSD commercial
offerings.

   Not that I'm ever likely to use it, but I was impressed, nonetheless.

This is unfortunately misleading there is NET-2 and NET/2 for Linux. The
first is FvK's work on Ross Biro's from scratch tcp/ip for Linux, the second
is a port of BSD Networking release 2 for Linux. Both exist, both are used.
In time NET-2 should be as good as the BSD networking, but for the moment
its providing some good lessons on interrupt and network writing.
The original primary motive was to avoid potentially 'contaminated' code
from BSD releases getting into Linux given the ATT v BSDI lawsuit. Without
that I'm fairly sure the BSD networking code would have been used straight off.
