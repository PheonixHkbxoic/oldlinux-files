Hi, netters

some time ago I got a Yggdrasil Linux (I think it was pl6 or 7).
I would like to contact the guy, who worked on the Andrew port.
Meanwhile, I investigated some work on it and about 75% of atk
part runs quite stable (ez, chart, zip and friends)
But there are still some bombing programs like prewiew and others...
Debugging Andrew isn't that easy, so maybe someone has got it done
already and can give me some hints.

Another thing: Who can help me with some details about the SCSI
audio commands of Sony CDU 8002 drive ? The drive works fine
on iso 9660 cds, but no chance with the common linux driver (541)
and audio cds.

Thanks in advance.

michael

It's the JOIN command actually, but it's a messy way of doing it.
Basically, you'd have your original DOS C drive partition - then you create
a directory on it, say, "TEST" and use:

JOIN D: C:\TEST

then when you move into the TEST directory, you are actually on drive D:

... and as an extra bonus, if you are running DOS 6 ...

      ... Microsoft didn't ship SUBST and/or JOIN !!

it's a messy solution .. forget it and just have a second drive. I have 5
partitions on my machine (I run OS/2 and DOS under BOOT MANAGER)

   "Too great for Intel?"  Ummmm... you may be interested in knowing that
it has been available on Intel processors for several months now... and
in fact, since Next is no longer producing hardware, the average person
is likely to see it *only* on Intel machines... :-)

Subject: SLS 1.03, IN-2000, and no disks
Date: Sun,  5 Sep 93 08:48:01 PDT

I now have the enhancement kit (I suspect the real important
part of it was the 8-pin DIP marked 2.7).  Just replacing the
PROM with 1.0356 (their latest firmware rev downloaded from the
bulletin board) didn't work.

I now have loaded SLS 1.01 onto my SCSI hard drive.  However, I also have
SLS 1.03 on an IDE hard drive, which has several problems.  The IN2000 portion 
of the kernel
now does

in2000_queue_command timeout!
in2000_queue_command timeout!
in2000_queue_command timeout!
...

upon startup, and no drives are found.  (This after several trivial fixes
to the IN2000 source code and the usual fixes to makefiles and host.c.)

Any ideas?

Also, why doesn't SLS 1.01 allow swapspace on my SCSI drive?  I put a 20
MEG partition of swap space and, when I try to use it, I get the message

in2000_abort

I would like to have more swapspace when running X.

Thanks in advance.

Yes.  It is supported by XFree86 1.3.  I'm using one right now.

Date: Sun, 5 Sep 1993 17:19:22 GMT

A few days ago I posted a bug report to c.o.l.development re SCSI
woes and kernel lockups with SLS 1.03.  From email responses I've
gotten, I understand that I need to:

    1. upgrade my kernel from pl11 to pl12
    2. compile the pl12 kermel with gcc 2.3.1 instead of 2.4.5

I've got the pl12 kernel sources, but don't know where to find a
gcc 2.3.1 distribution set up for linux installation.  I did find
gcc 2.3.1 sources and tried to build it.  I had some problems there
but eventually did get it built - only to then realize that I'd
probably misconfigured it before the build, and don't know how
to configure/install it properly for linux.

Can anyone point me towards a gcc 2.3.1 distribution of binaries and
support files set up for linux installation?  I think I may have a
set of SLS 1.02 disks which haven't been reused yet - - Might that
include gcc 2.3.1?  If so, and it it's less than obvious where it's
buried, can someone give me some pointers on locating it and installing
it on my SLS 1.03 system?

Am I having fun yet? :)

    As has been mentioned several times, your best bet is minix for the
8088 or xenix for the 286. The chances of anyyone porting linux to
either of these processors is minimal. xenix and minix are available
used for less than the cost of the SLS release on disk.

You sure can run linux on them.  Hook them up as terminals using null modem

Seriously speaking, even on a 286 I would not want to run Unix, because the
architecture of the chip is too crippled to support it.  Even though there
are versions of Unix (Coherent, for one) there are limits such as processes
cannot be bigger than 64K, and other restrictions which you don't have if
running on a 386.

But, they make good terminals though. :)

Well, then it wouldn't really be Unix, I don't think.  It also wouldn't run
as well.  It certainly wouldn't be something I would want to run.

  Things like WORDPERFECT are available for UNIX, but not as far as I
  know for LINUX. And I'd be surprised if it *ever* is.

Well, let me repeat my plug for 'doc', the WSYWYG editor/wordpro/DTP
thingie in the standard Interviews distrib. It may not have every
bell&whistle, but its OO organization makes it very impressive and
flexibe (yes, tables, pictures, multiple columns, whatever).

You can find ready-compiled interviews 3.1 binaries on most Linux
FTP sites; the name of the files begins with iv3.1 and they are in the
X11 subtree.

Which doesn't change the fact that it rivals NT for hardware requirements to
