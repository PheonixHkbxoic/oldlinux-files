>(Yes, it's mounted from fstab)

Hi:

I had myself problems with opening more than 2 X windows and 1 emacs
window on a 99pl12 linux (SLS 1.03), while having 8M RAM and having
declared at partitioning time:

mkswap -c /dev/hda2 16500 #16M of swap device
swapon /dev/hda2

The problem was only solved after I read an article by Kristian Ejvind
on this same moribond comp.os.linux (I did not find anything relevant
on the new comp.os.linux.help!!). 

Following his advice on a related query, I inserted the following
lines in my /etc/rc file:

mkswap -c /dev/hda2 16500
swapon -a

and 

/dev/hda2 none swap defauts  in the /etc/fstab file.

Now I can open more emacs and X windows and I am not getting the
complaint heard before:

"Memory exhausted" at the first command in emacs, like M-x rmail.

Would someone comment on why I had to insert these lines in those
files? I would have expected to get by  just by the commands at
partitioning time. Don't they have a lasting effect?

If they don't, this should be mentioned in the FAQs (I had all of them
in front of me, including the very good Linux Installation by Matt
Welsh). By the way fellows, it seems that any fear that not enough
pty's are generated, that I had, seems to be unfounded. In another
post, someone else mentioned that (naturally!) linux automatically
generates as many pty's as it needs. This as I tried in vain to use
mknod to generate more pty's for my xterms and emacses.

Thanks to Kristian.

Marius

Hi,
  I think this should be put in the faq ( if it isn't already :)
mount at boot time will not work properly if you're root partition
is not properly described in the fstab, it doesn't matter if all the
other devices are described properly, if root isn't descrided properly
mount won't work. If you manually install SLS it makes a wrong entry
in the fstab, trying to mount it on /root rather than /, also you have
to have one and only one white space chacter between fields, it is 
easy not to notice a space and a tab. The root device should be
described thus:
Device<tab>MountPoint<tab>FilessytemType<tab>defaults

I think that all right :)

        Ben Frank.

Subject: xterm problem when telnetting to a sun
Date: 19 Sep 1993 18:13:51 GMT

I'm having problems when I telnet to a sun/sparc workstation at school
and my term environment variable is set to xterm.

I am running x in linux over a slip connection.

If I login to my machine and then telnet over to the sun, it sets the variable
to vt100 which works great but I only get 25(24?) lines.

In my openwin-menu-s file I have the following line:

"Sun host"  exec /usr/bin/X11/color_xterm -sb -sl 500 -j -ls -fn (continued..)
    (from previous line) lucidasanstypewriter-14 -T "Sun"

And when doing this the sun thinks I'm using an xterm (good) but it doesn't
know how many lines my current window is set at and *always* tries to squeeze
more lines than possible in the window and it scrolls past the top.

HELP!!!
:)

I used the latest SLS distribution of Linux from sunsite.unc.edu, and
when I added a user with useradd, things went smoothly until I tried
to log in. The passwd field is totally blank in the passwd file, as is
the entry in the shadow file. When I log on, I type the user name,
and Linux informs me that my password has expires, and that I should
select a new one. It then promptly tells me (without letting me
type anything in) that the password cannot be changed. I have triple
checked my permissions on all pertinent files, and can't figure out what in
the hell is wrong. Anybody got any ideas?

Also, it seems that my whole filesystem is mounted on / AND /root. What
gives?

Thanks in advance, Linux saved my soul!

I was wondering if there exists a program to switch the IRQ number

controlling my top secret death ray).  I know you can do it in the
kernal if a #define or something, but I am runing a very small

(as well I don't have the swap space).  Any help appreciated.

Subject: SLS is working, sorta ...

Reply-To: verdant@twain.ucs.umass.edu


I managed to get SLS installed on a 386 with 4 MEG ram, on a 52KBlock HD
partition with a 3KBlock swap space (sizes via fdisk.)  I encountered
numerous problems during installation -- I had to boot a1.3 seven
times.  It eventually made it all the way through the installation
procedure (An,Bn,Cn,Dn,X1) without crashing.  It would not set up a
swap space from the menu due to bad (I think) batch files -- I did this
on my own from the prompt.

I keep on getting the following message: Unexpected HD Interrupt
It pops up sporadically just about everywhere.  This may be a hardware
problem, because I had to install Wordperfect 6.0 3 times on the other
partition before it finally took, due to ``Serious disk error''s which
occurred, also sporadically, throughout installation.

Anyway, a1.3 usually crashed due to a `kernel panic' where the kernel
ended up in `swapper mode' and a frozen machine.

The swap batch files returned the proper usage line for swap as though
it had been invoked with no parameters.  Also, they returned the following
error message, which popped up a lot (I may not have this exactly right):

extended memory exceeded in `new'.

I had none of these problems earlier when installing SLS from 5.25" floppy
on a 486 with 3.7Meg RAM and a 90Meg Linux partition, no swap partition.

Any comments?  Help or information would be greatly appreciated.

In the editorial of the german unix magazine iX 9.93 there are some results of 
a readership survey wich shed some light on this issue.
Of the iX readers 6% use linux at work. The most used commercial (not 
specified which this is) unix is 33%.
At home 60% use DOS, 56% Windows and 29% linux.
It seems that linux is on the way to become the most widely installed unix 
variant, due to the high proportion of home installs.
A Novell add in the same magazine claims that there are 4 million computers 
running unix. 
If linux is equally widespread in USA as it is in germany, there must be a 
considerable number of linux systems.
