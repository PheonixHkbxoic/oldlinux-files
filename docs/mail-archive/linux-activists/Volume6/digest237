Use "mgetty" from the "mgetty+sendfax" package. It has been written
especially for use with "smart" modems and offers extensive logging to
nail down problems.

Unfortunately, the configuration is not yet very sophisticated, you
have to do most of it in the source...

Hello,

I am completely new to both Linux and Unix in general, so be patient.
I have been playing with Linux for the last couple of weeks and have managed to get the minimal system installed on its own partion on the drive.  However, I don't seem to have the proper file system installed.  I ran mke2fs when I installed the system, but when I boot (from disk), I get a message saying that I shouuld run such and such a utility, similar to the mke... stuff.  I need to know what switches I should run with this command in order to make the file system correct.   Also, if I use the p command in fdisk, I am informed that I have a Linux/Minix file system.  Is this correct when an alternative file system should be there?  Also, if anyone could give me more detailed instructions on how to get X windows up an running than is available on the install... at sunsite, I would greatly appreciate it.

Please send responses to cwight@econs.umass.edu

Thanks, 
chap

BTW-- any installation and getting started hints would be appreciated as I have not made too much progress!

Hi,

I'm looking for a MODULA-3 (that's _no_ spelling mistake!)
compiler for Linux. I've seen something like that on a
unix source code CD ROM some time ago (I believe it was

the GNU MODULA-3 compiler rather a "to-C" translator?

Subject: 72 pin SIMMS and other stuff
Date: 17 Sep 1993 01:31:41 GMT

I am about to purchase a machine which I will run Linux on as well as 
DOS games.  Here are a few questions I have been compiling:

1) MotherBoards. There are many brands out there, with Micronics being 
the "best" (so I have been told). WHat is the advantage of buying these 
$400 vs $100 2 VESA 6 ISA MB's?
I am currently considering the Cache computers MB, and the Micronics.
(Cache is about $100 cheaper)

2) Memory. The Micronics uses 72-pin SIMMS vs. the 30-pin SIMMS in the 
Cache Computers board.  Is there any advantage to the 72-pin SIMMS?
(30-pin SIMMS save me about $100 over 72-pin.)

3) SCSI-2 ISA vs IDE vs VESA-LB. I am thinking about getting an ISA 
Adaptec 1542c SCSI-2 controller, and 877M 12ms/5M per sec Micropolis 
drive ($700!). Which is the best way to go? ISA SCSI-2, VLB BusLogic 
SCSI-2, ISA IDE, or VLB IDE? I have heard some things that say that 
putting 2 VLB cards in a system can slow it down considerably.

4) Video Cards....I am currently considering the ATI Graphics Ultra 
Pro w/2M and its Mach32 accelerator chip; It will be VLB as well.
Is this one of the best cards to get; also will this in combination 
with a VLB SCSI-2 controller slow down my system a WHOLE LOT?

5) BusMastering VLB. Is this a necessity? Would I see a noticeable 
speed increase? How about ISA BusMastering? Is this doing the same 
thing?

Thanks

Reply-To: mitchell@sosc1.sosc.osshe.edu

Hello.. has anybody made dip work as a dial in server? I haven't been able
to do it and here's what I tried:

added user slip
gave slip a passwd
edited passwd file and changed home directory to /tmp and login shell
    as /usr/bin/ds   -> more on ds in a second
edited /etc/diphosts: added a line thusly
    slip::home.lab.r1.usfws.gov:HOME:SLIP,256
edited /etc/inet/named.hosts to include home.lab.r1.usfws.gov as
   164.159.2.2
edited /etc/hosts and added same address

Net-guide said that you couldn't use "dip -i" as the login script because
login won't pass the -i. So I created a shell script which I called ds.
#!/bin/bash
dip -i

The guide suggested to write a small c program to use system("dip -i"), but
I don't know how to use the compiler yet. [I know I can write the program!]

Here's what happens:

I call using JNOS's tip (tip is just a dumb terminal mode). The modems
connect and I get the login prompt. I enter slip as the username and
give it the password. The login message appears and the line goes into
the RAW mode. I can see data being sent to the LINUX modem because the RX
light flickers.

When I try to start a telnet session with linux using JNOS. Nothing happens.

I've looked at the routing table and there is not an entry for sl0. According
to the dip man page, after dip is activated and sets the terminal line 
to the RAW mode, it's supposed to ask the network layer to set up a
route in the route table.

I've tried using ifconfig 164.159.2.2 sl0, but it won't allow me to configure
a line that's not active. 

Got any good ideas?

I've read the net-guide, serial-faq and the various man pages....
Thanks a lot!

# mke2fs -c /dev/hda1 75000

should do the trick. Of course substitute the proper device and the proper #

The only thing that I can think of to prompt the question is that the old fdisk
complains about partitions over 64M. You can of course ignore this.

What exactly happens when you try to format the disk?

Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 21:12:21 GMT

I'd like to create a disk that would allow me to boot off a floppy and mount
my /dev/hda3 as the root partition using my newly compiled kernel.

Ideally, what I'd like is that if there is no floppy in the drive, my
computer starts up and runs OS2.  When I wish to run linux, I'd like to
insert a floppy that either boots to /dev/hda3 ( my linux partition ) and
uses the kernel image on /dev/hda3 or just boots the new kernel off disk 
and mounts /dev/hda3 as root

The problem is, that I have an IBM VP which needs a bit of help to boot
( ie. from lilo, I must type at the boot prompt:
       BOOT: harddisk root=/dev/hda3 hd=966,16,31)
and because of this, the "make zdisk" does not appear to work...

I have  checked the LILO docs, and tried to follow the instructions but it 
didn't work ( the specigfic command was something like 
        echo run image=<zimage> | dd if= .....

Can anyone e-mail help?

Please?

   please do not include the garbage noise from c.o.l.* on the same
   CD that has all the fine software you'll be mirroring from the
   Linux archive sites.  If you want to make a 100% noise CD of
   c.o.l. postings, feel free to make a separate CD for it.

   You'll have my order in a heartbeat after the Nov/Dec CD is available
   unless it's all full with USENET postings. I'd be real interested
   in getting (yes, paying for) a CD mirror of the archives however.
   But not if the USENET noise is on the linux archive CD...

The complete c.o.l.* usenet postings for the entire history of Linux
fits in under 45 megabytes.  Given how big a CD-ROM is (~800 meg), this
is a small fraction of space available.  In fact, many CD-ROM which are
published are not filled to capacity, so it's not like including them
would necessarily be crowding anything else out.

If you think the Usenet postings are noise, ignore them.  But there are
some jems hidden in there.  Some people may be interested in access them
for reference purposes.

   yes I had this exact problem, which is caused when the serial port 
   is hung up by getty, it drops the DTR (which, since its a null modem), 
   drops carrier) and gived getty a HUP causing it to quit.

   I got around this my slightly modifying serial.c so that it didnt ever
   hang up a serial port.  (no hardware of mine needs it)

You don't need to modify the kernel.  All you need to do is configure
your getty program to set the CLOCAL flag.  Then the serial driver will
ignore DTR.

I don't think I have this problem (then again, I haven't run X for
20 minutes yet!!) My problem is that switching between virtual consoles
or exiting the server causes the video output to go into some weird text
mode that rolls the screen and is filled with "smiley" characters. Going
back to the graphic console displays a crapped out graphics screen. Exiting
the server and restarting it (blind!) restores the graphic screen, but the
same behaviour ensues when you switch/exit.
  But sometimes, it doesn't do this.

  I think the ET4000 driver has a few problems, although XFree86 1.2 from the
SLS was used for approx six months with no problems.

  I've mailed xfree86@physics.su.oz.au but have yet to get an answer.

  Any ideas, anyone?

Either boot from the hard disk for DOS, or use a program like stacker's

You need to make sure that you've set up the mouse in the
