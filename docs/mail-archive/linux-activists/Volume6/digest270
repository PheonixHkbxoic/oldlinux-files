The woes continue.  Will Tony get X up and running?  Tune
in next week ....

Well thanks to someone who mailed me a re-compiled Xserver
my ATI GU+ is now displaying the X environment.  It appears
that the next hurdle to surpass is  getting the mouse to
work.  Its is stuck in the center of the screen.  

I am using the mouse that comes with the GU+.  It is a busmouse.
It is connected to IRQ2.  In DOS, the driver it uses is a 
Microsoft Busmouse.  When I re-compile the Linux kernel with
this option, set my Xconfig to Microsoft/Busmouse and set
the appropriate link for /dev/mouse the X Server fails to
startup at all, saying it couldn't initialize the mouse
(a core device).  When I re-compile the kernel specifying
the Logitech busmouse, and do the appropriate things
in Xconfig and /dev/mouse, the X environment comes up,
but the mouse is not working.  BTW, during restart, the
kernel detects a Logitech mouse.  When I use the Microsoft
option in the kernel, the mouse is not detected during
restarts.

What could be the problem?  Are my IRQs ok?  Can I tell
Linux to use IRQ2 for the mouse explicitly?  Why is Linux
detecting a Logitech mouse while DOS sees a Microsoft
busmouse?  I have a Fax/modem on COM1 (using IRQ4).  Could
this be the complicating factor?  How do I tell Linux
I have a Fax/modem there?

regards,
Tony.

Reply-To: esrac@csv.warwick.ac.uk (Dawood Alam)

Compiled the latest Ultrastor 24f driver (Version 1.11) with linux
pl13. Compiled first time. Appears to be OK however there as still
problems when using a SCSI Archive viper 150S tape drive. When writing
to the tape drive everything is OK. reading from the tape drive causes
the machine to hang after some prolonged (5-10 mins) usage. The
problem seems to be very intermittent. The driver does not spew out
any error messages like the older versions did.

This new driver is supposed to work OK with tape drives but does not
appear to be reliable all the time. The same problem seems to exists
as with the older drivers. Any suggestions ?

Cheers

Hi,

I downloaded clisp.tar.z and maxima.tar.z from sunsite.unc.edu 
and followed README to install both packages.
Compilation of maxima had no error (but some warnings).
When I run maxima, it had following error message:

*** -EVAL: undefined function SYSTEM::MAKE-WINDOW

and I got following message no matter what I entered:

*** -symbol *WINDOW* has no value

I have no idea of what's going on, can somebody help?

You DON'T *NEED* to, I didn't configure LinuX kernel with any mouse support,

Here it is ... wrong device ... use /dev/ttyS0 and everything should be right.

Hi all,

My Boca IDE Plus controller card has just failed under warranty :) and
I would like to look into replacing it with a local-bus equivalent,
in the same price range, ie CAN$50-75 or not too much more. Does 
anyone have any experience with any such beast? Can anyone recommend
anything? Bear in mind that I am a student running _deep_ in the red,
and no matter how nice a card costing only $200 is, I will probably not
be able to afford it. Tell me about them anyway, though, no reason not
to drool :) .
If anyone has experience in the matter, I _must_ get a card which works
in both linux and OS/2, so one which doesn't require a driver, or is 
completely standard is needed.

Thanks,

Carsten

        The major sites for "life, the universe, and Linux" are:
                tsx-11.mit.edu          /pub/linux
                sunsite.unc.edu         /pub/Linux
                nic.funet.fi            /pub/OS/Linux
        I recommend getting *any* .FAQ file you find about Linux.  
        They have all been extremely helpful to me.  Also, I most
        heartily recommend the following documents from the Linux
        Documentation Project (LDP) :
                Linux Installation and Getting Started by Matt Welsh
                The Linux Network Administrators' Guide by Olaf Kirch
                Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide by Michael K. Johnson
                Linux System Administrator's Guide by Lars Wirzenius
        These are truly wonderful documents.  IMHO far better than
        most of the documentation available with the commercially
        available ($$$$ or &&&&) *nixen.  I threw away my AT&T SVR4
        ($$$$) system and haven't looked back!  (Actually, I would
        have to be dragged back kicking and screaming!)
        You can find these documents in :
                pub/linux/ALPHA/LDP on tsx-11.mit.edu
        A rule of thumb that I use is this: 
                If it's in any directory related to Linux documentation,
                GRAB it!  A great many people have spent a lot of their
                own valuable (unreimbursed) time and effort in developing
                and documenting this wonderful new OS and deserve a 
                great deal of appreciation for their efforts!  

        In answer to your specific question, term is a terminal 
        communications program that is very robust.  For more 
        standard terminal emulation I enjoy using minicom (currently
        version 1.4g)  It is very complete, compiled clean first shot,
        installed like a breeze, and is very well documented.

supports some MIDI cards, but the Yamaha module doesn't use a MIDI card, it
plugs directly into a COM port.  If I use any of the MIDI software for
Linux, can I use this module?  Also, is there a Linux/MIDI mail-list

I have a problem getting DIP talk to my modem with dip -t.  I have edited

will send commands to my modem they do not go.

My modem is on /dev/cua1 and works fine with other comm programs.

The program also seems to take permanent mess up further comm. with the
modem.  After killing dip and a restart of the comm program I can no
longer get the modem to recognize commands.

I seems like there is some init file for dip, is that true?  If so where
is it?

I am stuck until I can get dip to talk to a modem becuase I can't check to
see of I can get network connectivity until I can slip to a net.  I have
no local network access.

Well, folks, while the thread is here.....
I have an Acer 33D interlaced monitor, and I have an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+
VLB card.  I previously had a Trident card, and I've suspected my monitor
of dying on me for quite a while now :)

My X runs fine and I love it (especially with S3!) but I'd like to see a 
"safer" Xconfig if anyone out there has one... I won't be able to afford my
new Mag 15" Flat for a few months, and also don't want to lose my eyebrows
to flames shooting forth from my monitor in the middle of a session :)

I would also like to get some higher resolutions, but I'm no X guru.  Anyone
out there feel like helping me?

Subject: installing Xfree_mono
Date: Tue, 28 Sep 1993 14:55:34 GMT

Hi James,
        First, make sure you are using the correct server. /usr/X386/X
should be linked to X386mono.  Once you have got that, try the server
with a generic vga resoultion (640x480).  Use the Xconfig values for
the mono server also.  You should have X running with that.  If there
is still any problem, mail me again with the message that Xfree
displays when you activate the startx script.  This can be easily done
with:
                startx > /tmp/foo 2>&1

where /tmp/foo is a file containing the redirected output. Press
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to kill the X server when a graphics screen appears.
        If you manage to get the generic resolution working, you could
try tweaking the timings in Xconfig to get a higher resolution.  Note
that the non-banked mono server handles only 64k despite a 256k card so
that the maximum resolution (virtual or actual) is limited to 830x631
(or whatever products that does not exceed 64*1024*8).  Mail me again if
you want some sample timings from me.

HTH,

: There is a program called 'doc' in /usr/bin/X11 in SLS 1.03.

: the performance.  I had top running in another window, and doc
: was using over 80% of the CPU, even when I wasn't doing anything.

doc seemed to perform much more reasonably with a co-pro. Without, it is
unusably slowwwwww.

Xfree 86 works fine with Cirrus CLGD5422, 26, 28 cards. I use an ISA 5422 card
, it took me a while to configure it but now I have it. First off, you will 
probably need to force it to 1meg video ram (assuming you have it), mine
would only see 256k until I told it otherwise. Next, the 542x series use
12 clocks number 1...12 rather than MHz numbers for the clocks. For 
1024x768, I think it is clock 9 that is best. This depends on your monitor too.
There is a program in the Xfree 86 1.3 release that tweaks the scan 
parameters needed to set a monitor type.
 
Sorry, I am in Windows right now and I can't get to my Xconfig to enclose it.

 
Does X support the highcolor or truecolor modes on the Cirrus chips?

Just check to see what chipset they use on the motherboard. They last
time I looked at comtrade, they only used the Hint chipset for eisa,
which is not "true" eisa. See the unix hardware faq for more details.
