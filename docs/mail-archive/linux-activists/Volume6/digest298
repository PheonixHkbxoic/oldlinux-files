The novell protocols are available from novell for various amounts. IPX is
freely documented. SPX is about $1000 but I'm told Xerox SPP is identical
_PLEASE_ has anyone got any freely distributable Xerox SPP code/documentation.

The novell server spec costs you $15000 + royalties providing you only
want to write a client, or $30000 + royalties otherwise. Needless to say the
final output has to be binary only and subject to a novell license. Reading
their license rules by my interpretation its also impossible for us to do 
because you would seem to have to bar disassembly of your final result, which
is not allowed in the EEC.

Bits of NCP are known, and I hope eventually enough will be known to write
limited NCP support into Linux, for the moment I'm poking around at IPX, 
tho this will have to wait until the new network code is finished.

Try using kermit and then using rz/sz for file transfers.  It really flies,
just like Telix does.

To do this, just send the file via zmodem on the remote machine, then
escape to the kermit prompt, and say

Well, rampant speculation might place the blame on your cards, or perhaps
an outdated driver, I know David has spent a lot of time on some of
the network drivers, better performance is likely.

I regularly get 400+k/sec out of my cheapo DEC DEPCA card on a 386-20sx
with FreeBSD, and I don't think there are enough significant differences
between NetBSD 0.8 and FreeBSD for it to be attributable to the OS.

Hello,
        Can anyone tell me what the difference is between all the Linux
distributions. Software versions don't bother me much - it's always possible
to obtain new versions and recompile (correct?). However, as an experienced
UNIX chap I need to know what is actually different - does /etc change? Do
some use the sys V rc directory scheme and others BSD? Etc etc etc.

Obviously, the main part of linux is the kernel - this doesn't change much
other than versions I presume between the distribution. The same goes for
version of X, gcc, emacs, etc. However, where do the other things come from -
GNU binutils and fileutils ??? What about stuff in dev, etc, lib, usr/share,
sbin etc?

Anyone feel like shedding any light on the situation?

Cheers,

Hello there,

Does anybody has any experience in mounting from within Linux a DOS
hard drive that is compressed with SuperStor (or the like) ? 

I'm about to buy a biggger HD to install small but compressed DOS par-
tition, my guess is that it wouldn't work as SuperStor stays in bet-
ween the HD and the DOS when it is booted up, and if Linux is booted 
up instead then how in the hell would the compress/decompress work ?

Am I missing something ? Thanks for any hint/clue/answer/whatever ...

Subject: LaTeX guru?
Date: 8 Oct 93 11:49:57 -0600

I am trying to get my system converted over to Linux for everything but music
processing.  I found that I can put a very minimal DOS partition with Windoze
and Finale music composition up in about 30 compressed megs.  I have no need to
acces this from Linux.

I've tried the switch before, but haven't had much luck because of the fact
that I have had a very hard time getting LaTeX working properly.  Lots of the
documentation for LaTeX seems to be in TeX, which doesn't help me much.  THe
main problems I've had are getting it to work on a data file and getting the lp
daemon to work with my Epson Actionlaser II, a HP IIP semi-compatible.  (Works
fine with HP drivers in the 'doze!)  I can't pipe the output of a DVI-to-IIP
conversion to spool.
 
So, if there's anyone out ther ewho's a LaTeX setup guru, perhaps send me your
Email address so I can ask my many upcoming questions outside of this group, I
don't want to waste more bandwidth than I already have.  Once I can get it set
up and print out a simple TeX formatted file I'll be able to figure out how to
use TeX itself.  I'm converting to Linux today . . . this time there's nothing
that will stop me from switching permanently.

But it _is_ possible to set up a dedicated PC running both novell and
the PD SOSS server and let it gateway from NFS to novell. This way it
is possible to mount the Novell drives on the Unix (Linux) client.

SOSS is a PD (perhaps with some restrictions, but freely available) NFS
server for DOS. It includes the PC/IP TCP/IP implementation and runs on
a packet driver. I have run both a Novell client (with PDIPX, a Packet
Driver IPX) and this SOSS server together successfully.

Look for 'SOSS' with archie.

Mike.

I have been thinking about this for a while too.  I think it's a very
good idea.  In fact, when I learn a little more about C and X11
programming and when I have some free time I even plan to take it up
myself.  However, the scope of my program idea is a lot more narrower:
it only deals with user maintainance (adding/deleting).  Right now I use
the add_user/delete_user program with their long and hard-to-remember
command lines.  A X11 interface based on either OI/OB or Tcl/Tk would be
much more intuitive.  It doesn't even have to be too complicated, just
gather up the parameters and pass them to add_user/delete_user...  Like
another poster said, a curses/ncurses based interface should also be
available for those not running X.

I think it's quite ambitious for you to tackle all aspects of

the maintainers of these packages?

When you backed up with cpio, hopefully you backed up with a "c"

The cards are probably responsible for the slow (300-400 kbyte/s)
performance in general but they definitely have nothing to do with the
difference between the various OS's.  All my experiments were run on
the same two boxes; I booted off a different partition for each OS.

Is this card 8bit or 16 bit?

I have this tape drive working on one of my machines (SLS 1.01).
If you don't get any messages at boot time about the tape drive, 
then the kernel you're booting is not configured with the qic02 device driver.
It sounds like you're still booting the old kernel.  You need to
use lilo to install it -- just creating a new /zImage won't do.
You should create a new kernel on a floppy disk, and boot off the floppy
first to test things out -- don't clobber your working kernel 
on your hard-drive until your sure it's working from the floppy.
Look at the Makefile in /usr/src/linux.

Hope this helps,
 Kelly

I'm a happy user of "Allegro". This programm looks and works like "Norton

You're more than welcome to join in the effort.  Debian has changed quite a bit
since I first announced its existence in August; it has turned into a fairly
large group effort, as opposed to the "traditional" development stategy of
Linux distributions (development by one individual or small group).
