Note that IRQ is the cascade interrupt; when the bus mouse is set to tug
on the physical IRQ2, the software sees IRQ9. When you change
busmouse.h, don't change to IRQ2 (system will crash) change to IRQ9.
But leave the mouse on IRQ2. "It worked for me."

What you have to do prior to initiating the install script is turn on (and
allow linux to see/use) your defined swap partition, to do so simply login as
root and execute the following:

swapon /dev/hdax - where "hdax" is your mkswap formatted swap partition.
                   (ie "swapon /dev/hda3").

if everything goes as planned,Linux will report to you, a message similar to 
"adding xxxx K of swap"..

now you should have plenty of space to continue with the install..

Yes.  For all practical purposes, an unlimited number of SCSI devices 
are supported.

Unix devices are identified as either block or character (block 
devices go through the buffer cache, character devices do not) devices,
a major number (ie which driver is used - block major 8 corresponds
to SCSI disks) and a minor number (ie which unit is being accessed 
through a given driver - ie character major 4, minor 0 is the first 
virtual console, minor 1 the next, etc).  However, accessing devices through
this separate namespace would break the unix/Linux metaphor of 
"everything is a file," so character and block device special files 
are created under /dev.  This lets you access the raw third SCSI disk
device as /dev/sdc, the first serial port as /dev/ttyS0, etc.  

In your case, the kernel is aware of the disk, and has made an appropriate
entry in the SCSI disk driver tables for /dev/sdc.  However, your /dev
directory lacks an entry for it (do an ls /dev/sdc* and you'll notice that 
there aren't any files that match there).

The preferred method for creating a file is using the MAKDEV script -
cd /dev 

and run MAKEDEV (as root) for the devices you want to create - ie

./MAKEDEV sdc

wildcards "should" work - ie 

./MAKEDEV sd\*

"should" create entries for all SCSI disk devices (doing this should create
/dev/sda through /dev/sdp, with fifteen partition entries for each) 

./MAKEDEV sdc\*

"should" create entries for /dev/sdc and all fifteen permissible partitions
on /dev/sdc, etc.  

I say "should" because this is the standard unix behavior - the MAKEDEV 
script in your installation may not conform to this behavior, or may have
restricted the number of devices it will create.

If MAKEDEV won't do the right magic for you, you'll have to create the 
device entries by hand with the mknod command.

The block/character, major, and minor numbers are specified for the 
various SCSI devices in the SCSI-HOWTO : 

Section 4 : 
Subsection C : Device Files

SCSI disks use block device major 8, and there are no "raw" devices
ala BSD.

16 minor numbers are allocated to each SCSI disk, with minor % 16 == 0 
being the whole disk, minors  1 <= minor % 16 <= 4 the four primary 
partitions, minors 5 <= minor % 16 <= 15 any extended partitions.

Due to constraints imposed by Linux's use of a sixteen bit dev_t with
only eight bits allocated to the minor number, the SCSI disk minor 
numbers are assigned dynamically starting with the lowest SCSI HOST/ID/LUN.

Ie, a configuration may work out like this (with one host adapter)
Device                  Target, Lun             SCSI disk
84M Seagate             0       0               /dev/sda
SCSI->SMD bridge disk 0 3       0               /dev/sdb 
SCSI->SMD bridge disk 1 3       1               /dev/sdc
Wangtek tape            4       0               none
213M Maxtor             6       0               /dev/sdd

Etc.  

The standard naming convention is 

/dev/sd{letter} for the entire disk device ((minor % 16) == 0)
/dev/sd{letter}{partition} for the partitions on that device 
        (1 <= (minor % 16) <= 15)

Ie

/dev/sda        (block device major 8 minor 0)
/dev/sda1       (block device major 8 minor 1)
/dev/sda2       (block device major 8 minor 2)
/dev/sdb        (block device major 8 minor 16)

So, to manually create the devices for /dev/sdc, you could say
(as root)

mknod /dev/sdc b 8 32
mknod /dev/sdc1 b 8 33
mknod /dev/sdc2 b 8 34

etc.

Quite simple, make the 'other' entry the first in the config file.
My system has DOS as it's default, to be sure that accidental power on -

Subject: Diskless Linux
Date: 4 Oct 1993 10:55:11 +0100

I have a TCP/IP Boot Prom on a PC, that is able to boot MS-DOS. What I do
is to create a regular boot-floppy for the PC, copy that onto the server,
and then the PC can load this image into a ram-disk and boot from that
ramdisk. This all works fine.

I tried the same with Linux. Upon starting, the whole PC hangs when
LILO has output "LI". I suppose it is because LILO is trying to open
a device which in actual fact does not exist.

Could anyone help me ?
What would be the correct way to boot diskless Linux ?
What would the installation procedure be ?
Has anyone had experience in using Linux on a diskless system ?

Thank you very much.

It's not a prob of your XS3 package ...

Now, to fix this 'bug':

Login as root, go straight down to /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm and edit the config
file (forgot it's name, sorry).
Write the following line at the end of the file:

DisplayManager.*.terminateServer:       true

Save and reboot, and xdm will work correct.
