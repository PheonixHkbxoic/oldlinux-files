        I had this problem too.. had to assign initial passwords using the
        passwd command as root.  then it still wouldn't let users change
        their own passwords!  Finally screwed around with permissions and
        ownerships until it works fine now.  Settings that worked :
                file            mode    owner   group
                /bin/passwd     4755    root    root

                /etc/shadow     660     root    shadow
        this fixed everything (although I still assign the initial password

I hope this is the right group....

I am writing a program which is basically a commandline interface, talking in commands and producing a result. All parts of the commands are read in as character. However
once in the computer, some may need to be converted to a double or integer.

e.g. (set vat = 17.5)

set, vat, =, and 17.5 are all read in as a character name. Then "17.5" is converted to a double by the command 'double = strtod(spelling)'

My problem is that I can compile the program, but once I try and run the program, it gives me a 'floating point exception error' after the command to change vat (or any other string to double conversion).

The program works fine on the Sun, but not on my 486 at home, under Linux. 

How using the gcc compiler can I enable my program to work.

Thanks in advance for any help.
Paul.

P.s. thanks to everyone who helped me earlier.

I only have one modem and would like to use it in a dialin and dialout
capacity.  Do either of these packages allow for this without having to

  here goes another FAQ question(?)
  I couldn't find this in the FAQ.

It is probably the currently most frequently asked (and incompletely
answered) question...

  EXT2-fs warning: mounting unchecked file system, running e2fsck is recommended
  [EXT II FS 0.3c, 93/08/05, bs=1024, fs=1024, gc=17, bpg=8192, ipg=1592}

  I ran e2fsck several times but...  I am still getting this message...
  what's the problem?

The problem is that both the kernel filesystem code and fsck modify the
status of the fs superblock, and the kernel filesystem code wins out.

To prevent this the root filesystem must be mounted RO at boot, fsck'ed
and then remounted RW, and then it must be remounted RO just before shutdown,
which is achieved by unmounting it.

You need versions of fsck, mount and umount that support all this, and they
are part of the bootutils-0.1 package.

Once you have installed this, you must:

1) rename e2fsck to fsck.ext2, fsck to fsck.minix, and so on.

2) put 'read-only' in /etc/lilo/config, and rerun /etc/lilo/install.

3) put the following four lines in /etc/rc:


        fsck -A -a -av          # check filesystems while root is RW
        mount -n -o remount /   # remount the root so it goes from RO to RW
        rm -f /etc/mtab*        # remove stale mount table
        mount -A -a -av         # mount all, write new mount table

   [note: I am typing from memory; if I remember well the above sets of
   options *must* be typed exactly as shown, in exactly the order given.
   In particular the -A option *must* be the first, and either fsck or
   mount, I don't remember which, *must* have the 'a' option replicated
   because of a bug; you also *must* specify the 'n' option when remounting
   the root.]

4) make sure that your version of shutdown/halt/reboot does call
   'umount -a' before stopping the system and after having killed
   all processes.

5) make sure that your /etc/fstab lists *all* filesystems you want to mount,
   including the root; filesystems you don't want to mount at boot up time
   can be flagged as 'noauto', but then you must copy the 'noauto' patch
   from the 'bootsys' package.

The only thing I am a bit unsure about is whether one needs to reboot
in case fsck had to repair the root; IMNHO I think this is not
necessary, remounting *ought* to reload the updated filesystem
information.

Hi,
I got a problem when running X386. Sometimes the X-Server freezes 
the complete station. All X-Clients seem to stop ( clock doesn't
update, xload doesn#t update ). I haven't tried to login into my
station from remote, but i'm quite sure that the machine is hanging.
The problem is that this doesn#t hppen all the time. Sometimes
I can open lots of shell-windows and anything will work fine, but
othertimes the statiob hangs after opening just two windows.
I think my configuratuion in Xconfig is ok. I can create lots
of processes if I don't use X386.
I'm running linux 0.99p12 and XFree 2.0. Window-Manager is olvwm.
Hardware:  Cyrix 486DLC, VGA 16 ET4000 SVGA card, 8 MBYte RAM,
           16 MByte Swap space
Question is:   Is the defect described above a known failure
               (I hanve't found anything about it in README files). 
               Can I do anything to avoid it?
I've got a second problem:
 The size of my swap partiotion is about 22 MByte (shown by fdisk).
 I did a mkswap with the given size. When I say swapon /dev/xxxx
 I get 16xxx KByte swap partition activated. Why is there some swap
 space left unused ?
