Hi, all.  Thanks to those who answered.  Apparently the problem is that
the install file, as I received it, reads:

#!/bin/sh
./lilo $1 -C /etc/lilo/config

but where it says './lilo' it should say, instead '/etc/lilo/lilo'.

Once again, thanks, and I hope that this is changed in the next release.

Subject: Microsoft Inport Mouse
Date: Tue, 5 Oct 93 01:12:52 GMT


I'm having trouble getting Linux/XFree86 to recognize
my Microsoft Inport mouse.  I've got 99pl12.  Here's
what I've tried so far:

 Using the original kernel, which detected a MS Busmouse,
   Logitech mouse, and an ATI inport mouse at the same
   time (odd!), I created /dev/inportbm with major = 10,
   minor = 2.  Then, I specified Busmouse "/dev/inportbm"
   in the Xconfig, and also tried Microsoft "/dev/inportbm".
   I tried setting baudrate to 1200 and 9600 for both of these
   configurations.  Didn't work.

 Then, as per someone's suggestion, I recompiled the kernel
   and specified that I only wanted to detect the Microsoft
   Busmouse.  The kernel successfully detected only the
   Microsoft Busmouse.  I tried the above configurations in
   my Xconfig file again, and it still didn't work.

What's a fellow gotta do to get X to work with his Microsoft
Inport mouse?  

I also tried making a symbolic link from /dev/mouse to
/dev/inportbm, because there was some comment on this in a
man page or doc file I read.  That didn't work (obviously).

Oh, one other probably relevant piece of information: I've
got an S3 chipset, and I'm using the XS3 Xserver.  Is it
still Linux's responsibility to enable my mouse, or the xserver's?

Any suggestions?  Please mail scottco@lynx.cs.washington.edu,
as I don't read here very often (I'll post with a solution
if one comes through).  Thanks,

Actually, the Island series is very well known.  I prefer island write to

How about getting GNU C++ for your sun and installing that?  It's 
specifically configured so you can bootstrap yourself up to a working
copy with almost any C compiler, and then you'll have full ANSI C and

   Xsysadmin - this is what I want to write, only I think there already is
   a lot of code outside? 

   Please contact me if you are working on something similar, have done something
   alike or have something stuffed away which did not work to well...

   I would like to make a LinuxConfigurationtool for
           - usermaintainement (incl. shadow-support)
           - uucp
           - smail
           - cnews / tin
           - internet
           - cron
           - printers

   I do not know whether it is a good idea to put this all into one program,
   especially since many people should contribute to this program - I cannot
   do it all alone. 

   I will throw myself at the user-maintainement-stuff first.

I personally would like to see some tools like this for text mode as
well since a graphical version will be much larger and slower to
navigate.  It will be great for some but suppose you are not able to
get X running or don't use it?  I wonder if we could write core
routines for doing things like parsing the various files and then
patch them together under the different interfaces.  Just an idea.  I
would like to do this but I have another major project in the works.
It's possible that it will not be feasible to provide different
interfaces to the same code but I would think parsers and low level
file manipulators would be pretty much common to both.

Just edit /etc/issue.

It's a really great place to color ANSI escape sequences.  Better, don't
switch back to white and you get colorized text (until an ANSI reset).

To boot from the hard drive you need to run LILO. My experience is that
the LILO that comes from the Yggdrasil distribution will not work, because
of some incompatibility with the run-time library. With some trouble I
got LILO to run from a second Linux installation on another partition, 
from SLS, but this is of course not a recommended fix.

In fact, I am not very happy with the Yggdrasil CD. As a CD, it is 
expensive to produce an update, and the Yggdrasil is patchlevel 5 or 7,
while the newest Linux version is pl 13. Probably we are better off 
with a bigger hard disk and the newest version from SLS or downloaded
from the net. E.g., Yggdrasils linux does not recognize ext2 file systems.
