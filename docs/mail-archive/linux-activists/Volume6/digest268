You can run DS on the DOS partition, but Linux will not be able to access
those files with it's MS-DOS filesystem.  I don't know what the sway 
partition is for, does that rock the disk? :-)  BTW, Stacker is better,
in case nobody told you. <double grin>

Nope.  Welllllll, maybe.  I have a program FIPS08.ZIP that I found on
a BBS, it will shrink a disk partition if it's the only one on the disk.

Another tape-related question: The SLS installation script offers
installation from tape. Is this from QIC-Floppycontroler tape or only
SCSI tape, and how does the installation work ? Just to tar the whole
SLS directory tree onto the tape and then boot from the bootdisk and
say "installation from tape" will hardly do the job, I suppose ?
Do I need a special form of the SLS package, and if so, where can I
get it ?

How can you compare hardware to software??

This is like arguing about how this VCR tape compares to that VCR
ot how the Cosby show compares to my TV!

Let me explore the posibilities here a little bit.
My 386/25 with  no cache and 8 Meg of DRAM will run rings around
a SUN IPC if I put 1meg of DRAM into it (yes I do think it still would run).

However An 486DX2/66, with external cache, localbus accelerated SVGA
card, 32 bit EISA or VESA bus, and SCSI drives, with the same amount
DRAM running linux will probably run rings around an IPC.

Jack, a quick glance at the docs will answer your question. If it
matters, I run two dial in/out lines.

getty (getty_ps 2.07) can be setup two ways. One method permits
callouts on the same dial-in line. First, you can have getty answer
the call for you. It will monitor the modem and wait for a RING. When
it gets this, it will issue an ATA to the modem and it answers the
call. The only problem with this is the serial line is held open
constantly and will not be available to other programs to call it. The
second method is to let the modem answer the phone. getty does not
hold the line but just waits for the DCD line to do something.
Alternatively, it can wait for a character to do something.

Check the man page. It's all in there.

Date: Mon, 27 Sep 93 22:32:36 GMT

I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting Linux (SLS distribution) to 
work with a 3com 3c509 (combo, for what its worth).  I think that I have 
uncommented the appropriate lines in CONFIG and modified the Makefile to 
include el3.o (after copying the 3c509.c file to el3.o).  The new kernel seems 
to find the card on bootup (it spews some lines starting with eliii, which do 
list the right IRQ and I/O address).  However, the line in rc.net

                               ifconfig eth0 130.99.34.55 ...

gacks and spews some errors along the lines of

SIOCSIFADDR invalid argument, 
SIOCGIFFLAGS invalid argument
etc.


It apparently doesn't like the eth0 device.   The file /dev/eth0 is linked to 
/dev/wd0.  Is this right for the 3c509?  The link was created by the 
installation.

The ifconfig command for lo don't complain.  The route add 130.99.24.0 command 
complains with a Network cannot be reached error.

Any hints/ideas would be appreciated.

Subject: Help install X386_Mono
From: ph9991ha@uwrf.edu (James F Hall)
Date: 27 Sep 93 18:33:49 -0600

I need some help in installing the mono server for X on my machine.
Anyone have any experience with this?

Basically, I can get X to run, but all I ever get is a bunch of
static, or vertical lines on my screen.  Seems like the video mapping
isn't set correctly.

I appear to be able to move the mouse, because if I move it, the
shading of the lines on the screen seem to shift around or change
brightness.  There were no errors reported when I issued % startx

But I can't really use X at this point, because I can't see what I am
doing.

--

My system: 386dx with 8Mb physical memory, Dexxa 2-button Microsoft-
compatible mouse, older vga card with 256k vga ram.  I'd rather not
buy a higher-quality vga card, since I really won't be using X to do
more than view DVI files, and to use gnuplot, both of which are
_essential_.

--

I think I had posted this before, but either no one felt they could
repond meaningfully, or my poster was broken.  I would appreciate the
help, though.  Getting X to run is the last thing on my "to-do" list
before Linux is fully tailored for me.

I'd also be open to a one-on-one dialog with any Linux X-wizard.

There is "doc", which I have to admit I have not used seriously enough to

FUNNY you should mention this...!

I just went through the same procedure, with EXACTLY the same software
& tvga card, two days ago.  It sounds like you are running into the same
problem that I did; your monitor is interlaced, and you are trying to run
X as though the monitor is non-interlaced (or vice-versa).

Try changing your Modes entry:
     "1024x768"   to   "1024x768i".
That worked for me.  But I actually took that entry out entirely, and just
use the 800x600 config; it's a lot more legible on my screen.


NOW: please take this advice for what it's worth: very little.  I just
started on this Linux/X/vga business, and...

My monitor is still EXPLODING.  I just sat down in the den, and was
startled to hear the crackle of electricity.  I looked at my monitor, and
it was black (screen-saver), except for the odd flash and flicker and
sound of electical cracking.

Electricity makes me nervous at the best of times.  Guess how long it
took me to kill the power on the monitor, computer, and every other
electrical appliance that just looked at me funny.

HELP!???   Is it the screen saver?  X server?  Bad card?  Bad monitor?
Bad hair day?   Mine is a 'Darius' interlaced SVGA monitor HRV-1025.
Even after I turned it off, it crackled.  It's staying off until I get
some advice.  So there.

I suggest the second method (set the modem on auto-answer) unless
you want to use ringback, where your modem only answers after
a certain number of rings, then a pause, then more rings (useful
for sharing the line with your voice phone). This method is
much simpler since you don't have to worry about quite as much.
What you *do* have to make sure of is that your modem asserts
CD when a carrier is present, and that it is set to auto-answer.
You can set this in the modem's NVRAM settings (recommended)
or in the INIT string in your uugetty setup file. This way you
don't have to worry about things like INITLINE or a CONNECT chat.

My script "lpd.build" (see C.O.L.A) is useable for both - with Slackware,

I have been working with DIP and SLS 1.0.3.  I followed all of the latest

When I use DIP I can not get it to talk to the modem.  I have a 14.4 modem

I use:

        dip -t

Then when I exit dip via a ^C, the modem line is frozen for use by other
comm. programs.  I have to reboot.  No processes seeem to be runningnas
shown by ps.

The /dev/cua1 and moem work fine for normal telecom.

As the original person who started this thread I must say that my intentions
were to elaborate in the artical itself and not the subject header.  As far
as a general comparison between the two, I think it is perfectly valid since
we are talking about systems that can potentially run the same ported software
, applications that can be directly compared because they are identical at the
source level.  Not only can this comparison be kind of objective but helpful.

The SUN IPC costs many times more than a typical Linux system.  That is even
if you took a 'Maxed Out' PC and put Linux on it you could give the IPC a run
for its money.

P.S. I am sorry about your computer, time to upgrade rather than get angry.

No, it certainly is not a screen saver.  You must be careful because
the wrong settings in your Xconfig can permanently dammage your monitor.
I have read many reports about people frying or burning out monitors.

Good news though, It sounds like you have the exact same equipment as I
have, that is: tvga8900, and a Darius HRV-1024 (?).

I have posted my Xconfig before (a few days ago) and it is the one that
works perfectly with my setup in colour.  So let me know if you want me
to post it again.
