I would very much like to see this when you get it finished..  If you're
in FidoNet, maybe an address to freq it, else perhaps somewhere to FTP 
it from..  Also, since you're working with it, you know somewhere to get 
the port of BinkleyTerm?  Been looking for it, but since the closest 
thing I have to FTP over here is FTPmail, it gets a little hard to hunt 
everywhere..

My passwd, won't change my passwd.  Root doesn't have a passwd, and I've tried
to reset it several times to no avail.  It allows root to login without a
passwd.  What should I do?

Worked for me too, but didn't crash at IRQ2 - X just could not use the mouse.
Linux kernel (0.99.9) said it found a Logitech Busmouse no matter what IRQ it was at
(I removed the par./ser. I/O card and tried the mouse on IRQs 2-5 with kernel set to
default 5 - Linux always "found" it, but X only worked on IRQ 5 = kernel setting).

One slight problem for me though :-(

Linux (and MS-DOS Logitech driver) will work with the Mouse set to IRQ 2 (the Linux
kernel being configed for IRQ 9), but MS-Windows just freaks out completely!
Ocasionally I do need MS-Windows <yuck!>, so I have had to put the mouse back on
IRQ 5, which means no IRQ for /dev/lp2, which means dead slow printing compared to
/dev/lp1...

Wrong newsgroup, I know  -  But if anyone has any ideas about my MS-Win prob please mail!

Andrew.


P.S. Had the same problem when I configured my Adaptec 1542C for IRQ 14 (I was asking for
trouble! :-)

Linux and DOS had no problems, but MS-Windows 3.1 absolutely nuked my DOS partition's FAT!
I guess any Linux kernel that included IDE support would also barf...(?)
Have to look for those free IRQs elsewhere... How about COM4 on IRQ 14 instead of 12? :-)

I've done some network throughput and latency benchmarks of NetBSD 0.8.
I don't have a box running linux, so I don't know how fast it is.

Measurements were done using 2 33 mhz 486dx boxes with 16 MB RAM and
3c503 ethernet cards. The machines were run in single user mode on a
private ethernet.  The systems measured are NetBSD 0.8, Mach 2.5, a
vanilla Mach 3.0 system using the TCP/IP code in the UX unix server, a
vanilla Mach 3.0 system using the BSDSS unix server, and a Mach 3.0
system using the library-based TCP/IP implementation.*

TCP throughput was measured using ttcp (anon ftp from sgi.com in
sgi/src/ttcp) which is a 16MB one-way memory-to-memory transfer.

system                  codebase        kbytes/s

NetBSD 0.8              BNR2            320             
Mach 2.5                4.3BSD          457
Mach 3.0(UX server)     4.3BSD          415
Mach 3.0(BSDSS server)  BNR2            382
Mach 3.0(library)       BNR2            469

UDP latency was measured using a ping-pong test: a client bounced
packets off a server 10000 times and divided the total elapsed time by
10000.  This set of benchmarks is available through anon ftp from
mach.cs.cmu.edu in src/net-latency-tools.tar.Z.

UDP round trip latency (in milliseconds)

system                  message size (bytes)
                        1       100     512     1024    1472
=============================================================
NetBSD 0.8              2.63    3.49    6.04     9.54   12.50
Mach 2.5                1.83    2.44    5.19     8.51   11.41
Mach 3.0(UX)            3.96    4.67    7.86    11.65   15.00
Mach 3.0(BSDSS)         4.64    5.37    8.95    13.23   16.84
Mach 3.0(library)       2.12    2.68    5.41     8.74   11.66

So NetBSD's networking performance is pretty dismal compared to Mach.
I don't know why but I imagine it has something to do with device
drivers and low level code that does context switching and stuff
because the actual network protocol code is very similar in all cases.
To be fair, no one has ever tried to tune up NetBSD.

[More details on these benchmarks and the library-based TCP/IP
implementation are in doc/published/user.level.protocols.ps on
mach.cs.cmu.edu.]

Cheers,
Chris

Yes, that would also ease porting it (I already think of porting it to our SUNs,
- as most of the functionality probably isn't Linux-specific -
though not a single line of code has been written ;-) ).
And usually noone owns the "commercial" OI/UIB.

The best way to do this.
Though UIB is quite simple too use, doing subclassing needs further
documentation than supplied on-line (at least I had some problems).
So "C" programmers can supply functions code without working into OI.

Yes. There's too much functionality needed than a single programmer can supply.

Hi,

I just got the Trans-Ameritech CD-ROM which contains copies of several different

I am experienced at Unix, but new to Linux.

XView's UIC library is an object-oriented C++ interface to XView, if you
prefer that to the C interface.

Always remember that XView has one major advantage over OI:  it's freely
available, so it can be used on more systems than just Linux for Intel.  (Of
course, whether the *BSD folks want anything to do with this is another issue
entirely...)  Moreover, since the source is available, you have something to
work from other than a reference manual when developing a character-mode
version that uses the same API and equivalent semantics.

My own vote would probably be for Tcl/Tk, with a curses-based Tk replacement
for character mode terminals.  I think John Ousterhout commented on the
possibility of such a Tk alternative being in a future Tk release --- but we
would probably have to roll our own rather than waiting.  Still, Tk is freely
available source, so it's a lot easier than cloning OI's functionality would
be.
