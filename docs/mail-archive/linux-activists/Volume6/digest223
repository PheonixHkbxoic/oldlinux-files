I had the same problem when booting off a1.3 of the SLS 1.03 dist.
After my sound card is recognized, it just hangs.  I have a Pro Audio
Spectrum 16, and I never had any interupt conflits while running under

No flames, just a redirect.

Your questions are among the most commonly asked, so a FAQ (frequently
asked questions) list has been put together with all the answers.

Here's two things you need to know:

1.  This newsgroup is being phased out in favor of comp.os.linux.****,
where **** is "help", "development", "misc", and "admin".

2.  In comp.os.linux.help, there is a regularly posted article with the
subject "READ THIS BEFORE POSTING..." or something like that.  It tells
where to get all sorts of info on Linux.  After you've read all the stuff
it points you at, you should check the help newsgroup for any other
questions you may have, then post if you don't see it.

Have fun.

Thrashing occurs when the primary activity of the OS is dealing with page
faults..ie, servicing requests for the necessary pieces/parts of the
executable(s) and data.  Even though your system is not necessarily under
a heavy load, very little seems to happen.  A lot a swapping does not
necessarily mean your system is thrashing, which is not to say that you
wouldn't want more ram.  I can't say about your situation from here.  I'd
be more inclined to believe that you're having problems with your ram
(assuming you're not also running X at the same time...a heavy load for
5 megs of ram).

I don't think I've heard of a need for more than 16 megs.  I run fairly
well with 8 megs physical and 16 megs swap, which includes X.  I plan
on getting more, but I'm not exactly suffering from excessive swapping.

I'd start by pulling that bank of 256K simms out just to see what happens.
If you run about the same (or even speed up), then those simms are either
defective or not entirely compatible the other bank of simms.  Like many
other OS's, Linux uses ram more thoroughly ( poor choice of words, but the
right ones won't come to me) than something like DOS, and will 'separate
the wheat from the chaff', so to speak.

I hope vendors aren't trying to make hay over the fire at that resin factory;
it was back in operation in at least partial capacity about two weeks after
the accident.   Just previous to this, 70 ns RAM (what I use) was averaging
about $35/meg from most of the vendors I pay attention to.  Has this changed
very much?   Just as an example of what can happen, a local PC show had 
vendors selling 60-70 ns RAM at anywhere from $40 - $95 per meg just after the
fire; at least that's what I was personally aware of.

  I have experienced the same problem - I have noticed that the error occurs
when the comm program writes what it has to disk.  it may be just a 
coincidence, but wouldn't that mean that the incoming data is overflowing?
I dunno....just a wild stab.  I would appreciate a real answer, though, if
anyone knows whats going on.

Hi everybody!

Now I am going to kill MessDoss off my computer.
What I want is the linux system, X11 with xview, gnu C++ to run with 
an Adaptec 1542C and Quantum LPS240S plus Genoa 7900 Videocard.
The question is:
Where will I get the latest sources needed, and what will I need
to fetch? I have searched several ftp sites in germany, but did not
find very useful information about that. I understand that the current
version of kernel sources is something like 0.99-12, but what about the
rest? Is there a special linux edition of X11 and gnu packages, or should I
get the standard unix distributions? And is there some precompiled version
of gcc anywhere?
How much disk space would I need for the whole lot?

Answers to email address below s.v.p.

A lot of people made a bundle speculating on the rise; a lot of people
will lose a bundle as soon as the bubble explodes. There is no content
to the idea that the factory fire affected production schedules for RAM
packages; it was very probably just used as an excuse by some clever
people with lots of SIMMs on stock to unload them at a high price by
stimulating a panic.

If you want to prove this to yourself, dear reader, just consider: the
factory supposedly produced chip bonding resin; thus in practice only
the SIMMs using 1Mbit chips should have become significantly scarcer and
more expensive, not *all* SIMMs, including those using 4Mbit chips
(which require 1/4 of bonding resin per megabyte as the others). What
instead has happened is that there has been a proportional, not flat
raise in price.

If you get any responses to this, I'd be interested.  I know there is
something online which you might try compiling, called maxima-4-155
which you might be interested in.  But it might not do everything
you're looking for.  I myself have sent e-mail to Wolfram asking them
whether they'd be interested in a port to Linux or 386bsd, and they
haven't responded.  However, in my latest edition of the Mathematica
Newsletter they mentioned they are porting to several new
architectures /systems, including NextStep for Intel.  This version is
currently in the testing stage, which is a far cry from the 'planning'
stages of some of the other architectures...

Hope this helps.

        8 megs should do you ok. It used to be more than enough, but the 
jump from gcc 2.3.3 to 2.4.5 seems to have increased memory usage by a 
bit. I never had swapping with 2.3.3 in 8 megs, now, about 1.5. meg 
gets pushed into swap when I compile the kernel. Most of this is 
probably from the switch to g++, but even compiling c code is slower 
with 2.4.5.

Subject: Need install help on SLS disks!
Date: 12 Sep 93 19:02:45 -0600

I've been a regular reader on this group for ~1yr, and I thought I had down
all the options for getting out of an install problem for Linux.  No such luck
on my first install attempt today.  I need help!

--

INFORMATION:

I am using the SLS disks obtained from Softlanding Software directly.  All
disks write-prot. EXCEPT disk A1 (as per instructions.)  Previously, I've been
running Dos 5.0, no Windows (if that makes a difference.)

I run a '386 DX machine with VGA, 80Mb hd, 8Mb ram, 1 1.44Mb 3.5" drive, 1
360kb 5.25" drive (never used anyway).

I want to install the full base system + XWindows.  (~70Mb)

Yes, I have read the manuals and the info sheet that came with the disks
explaining how to install.

--

PROBLEM:

Upon install, I was given this description of my system:

/dev/hda1    *    1    1    980    83291+    DOS    16-bit >= 32M

This looked okay, so I chose "Done" on the menu...  I assume that the "DOS
16-bit" part is normal, that it recognizes that I have DOS on there already.

But when SLS was trying to install Linux on my system, I was met with a
thousand error messages telling me that it couldn't create directories, or
that files did not exist!  After trying to install several pkgs from the menu,
I quit, and checked that there WAS INDEED Linux on my system.  Yup, I have
Linux on my machine.  Or at least, I have a root directory with /bin and all
that.

I tried to install Linux _again_, thinking maybe I had misinterpreted tar's
error messages.  But, now it claims that it's run out of disk space, and I
sure as heck didn't install anything more than the FAQ and some of the bin
files!  (I kept install notes.)

--

If anyone can help me, I'd appreciate it greatly.  The info sheet from SLS
says that their release takes the "hassle out of setting up" a Linux system,
so I assume that I am just being a dummy ;-)  and misinterpreting something.

Please tell me that I haven't f*cked something so badly it can't be undone. 
I'm a physics major, not a cs major, so I'm in the dark here.

Hi, Netters,

I need suggestion/advice on the following:

  1) I plan to buy a PC and put Linux on it. The machine will use phone line
to connect to my department machine. Is GW2000 Dx2-66 a good choice?

If buy from GW2000, then
  2) Which RAM config is more appropriate, 8meg. or 16 meg.?

  3) I suppose the ATI XLR card works with Linux? I don't read this group
very often, but have seen quite alot discussion/complaints about the ATI
vs. Diamond stuff :-)

  4) I plan to install X11 on the PC. How big should the HD be? Is 340meg
appropriate? I remember seeing someone suggested to ask GW that the HD been
pre-partitioned for both Linux and Dos, how and what should I ask?

  5) I guess it's better to get a true USR modem from another vendor instead
of GW? Can anyone suggest some names? How about their price, and software
for the modem?

  6) How about the CD-ROM from GW? Is it supported by Linux? or more generally
it it true SCSI-2 drive? If not, where can I get a CD-ROM working with both
DOS and Linux? Price?

I ran a Unix SVR3 on a 386/25.  I then upgraded the machine to a
486/33.  Overall system performance was *twice* as fast (using the
same peripherals) with the 486 machine than on the 386.
