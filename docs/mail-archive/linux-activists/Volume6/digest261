Several messages have pointed to a serial HOWTO file. I checked the HOWTO

on sharing irqs, getty, slip - in short, things regarding ttySx.
 
Can someone point me to the file, or better yet, post it?

There is a program called 'doc' in /usr/bin/X11 in SLS 1.03.
I've tried it very briefly, but I was very disappointed with
the performance.  I had top running in another window, and doc
was using over 80% of the CPU, even when I wasn't doing anything.

I once saw another package that seemed to generate nroff.
I think it came with InterViews or something.  Has that been
ported to Linux yet?

the SCSI is a Adaptec 1522 compatible (something) so I don't know what
that means for Linux.. it "might" work with the linux 1522 drivers,
it might not.

I would be suprised if Linux had a problem running on the AMBRA computers  
in general though. Most decent-quality motherboards have no problem
running it. (notice, not decent PRICE, but decent QUALITY)

Well, they told me "patience is a virtue" and I'm finally putting that
to use when running Xmosaic with term via 14.4 Kbps USR Sportster modem.
It takes 1.5 - 2.0min for a 640x480 weather satellite photo to come up,
which ain't too bad considering what you're getting! If you have something
else to do (e.g. browse text in another Xmosaic window :-) so much the

Being pedantic, txconn does not start a remote X server.  All it does is make
the remote system think that your Linux X server is a server running on the
remote host's display (ie hostname:9.0)

As far as the 'spirit' of the GPL goes, the only opinion that really
matters is that of the author who put the software under it.  Linus
has said in the past that he has no objection to profit-making
distribution of Linux.

Actually, the install guide I 'got' says you can repartition your HD with

Subject: Memory and swap errors on pl13
Date: 25 Sep 93 14:11:19 GMT

Ok, I just installed Linux Slackware pl13.  

I get the following errors while the system is running, and then the
whole thing locks up.

"unable to handle paging request at address c0000012"

"trying to free non existant swap page"

"bad page table [00cf902c]=00000400"

"NMI received.  Dazed and confused, but trying to continue."    

These errors have been received durring various tasks.  I loged in last
night, and left it on.  When I woke, I had a few of these errors on
the screen, and the VC was locked up.
I do not receive all these errors at the same time, with the same memory
addresses.  I get combinations of these erorrs, but I feel they are all
linked with one another.
I have a 486dx2/66 with 20 mb or ram. Linux is installed on an
XT-2190 maxtor MFM, with 1224 cyls.  This is over 1024, but I have kept
all partitions, including the swap, to under the 1024 barrier.   This
was for testing purpouses.  now that I know it is not the problem, I
will use the extended portion of the hard disk.


Please help!  

Btw, thanks to all who helped me witht he ultrastor 34f! It works quite
well now!

Subject: More cheap serial ports!
Date: 25 Sep 1993 08:16:03 -0700

These lines must be added to rc.local or somewhere in system 
initialization (as early as possible to prevent problems later)
Note that I specified ALL the serial ports, even the two standard
ones on the el-cheapo i/o & ide board as well as 0x3e8 and 0x2e8
which don't exist, just to avoid problems.  When I get another one
of these STB 4-COM boards, I plan on disabling both uarts on the
i/o board, assigning IRQ 4 to the first STB card and IRQ 3 to the
second one and thus gain back 3 IRQs for more productive use :)
(such as another SCSI HA and another parallel printer)
If STB comes up with a way to alter the base ports address (say to 100)
then I'd probably get another two of these cards also! (are you listening,
STB???)  In the meantime I might reverse-engineer the circuit and get 
out the ole soldering iron myself!

yan (yet another note) - you MUST use setserial-2.01 to pull this off.
        (it can be found at tsx-11.mit.edu I believe)

This is a very reasonable 4-port solution requiring no driver
software additions.  I think you can get the board for about
$110.00 (us) - at least I did.  Some company was mentioned here
on the net as selling them.  If you need their phone number and
or address and exact price, leave me email here and I'll send it

Hope this helps those who, like me, are IRQ-challenged!

Need more cheap serial ports but short on IRQs ?

will go to anyways.

This is a very reasonable 4-port solution requiring no driver
software additions.  I think you can get the board for about
$110.00 (us) - at least I did.  Some company was mentioned here
on the net as selling them.  If you need their phone number and
or address and exact price, leave me email here and I'll send it
to you -- don't want this to become a "home internet shopper's channel"
now do we!

Hope this is of help to those who, like myself, are "IRQ-challenged"

Subject: LINUX on IBM microchannel ?
Date: Sat, 25 Sep 1993 15:37:26 GMT


   I am very interested on finding out why this wonerful OS does
   not work on IBM mirochannel machines. The FAQ says something about
   lack of progamming data on the HD controller and that it might work
   if used with an SCSI controller and drive. My question is , is this 
   the only problem ?. As far as i know , the microchannel bus is
   invisible to the software that operates on it, but this could
   depend on how deep one reprogramms a system.
   The main interest of me would be getting LINUX running on a 
   ps/2 model 77 (486 dx) which has a standard SCSI controller 
   8 mb of RAM and 212 mb HD. 
   Cause my current test setup is a 386dx ISA clone which has a
   rather small IDE HD and only 4 mb ram. Any info, comment, 
   or pointer to information will be welcome
   BTW it would be interesting to make LINUX run on a Thinkpad 
   laptop due to their big screen.

   Email or post here, i`ll check both.
    
                                           Thanks in advance.   
                                                Roberto.

        You might have a getty active to it - check inittab.  If this is
        the case, your comm programs will not be allowed to snatch it.  Use
        uugetty instead (but check doc for right parameters!)
        If this is the case, you can call it whatever you wish and getty will
        still own it and not let go!

  Since the ambra line seems to be a very standard `clone` linux and/
  386bsd will probably run fine (! I haven`t tried it out cause there
  are no ambras out here...) , youl better wait till somenoe does
  the experiment for you.

  About AIX , there is an intel port (version 1.3 i`think) that runs
  on microchannel and ISA (EISA) machines. The AIX for isa / eisa
  acesses the hardware (video , HD and so on) trough a V86 task
  making it compatible with almost anything. THE BIG PROBLEM IS $$$

  If you have the money you`ll be better of with solarisX86 2.1 
  or with he very cheap (U$ 166) Unix from Unix system Laboratories
  (the inventors of unix) now on the hands of Novell.

                                               Hope it helps.
