I would like to know exactly which files/libraries and/or directories I can
remove from my Linux system which has to do with Xwindows?  I have removed
Xwindows and would like to take off any other support stuff that is there cause
I need my extra hard disk space for a project I am working on in school.

Thanks

Subject: SLS wont mount /proc
Date: 11 Sep 1993 18:31:04 GMT
Reply-To: ldr@maki.EBay.Sun.COM

Hi all,

I'm having problems with mounting /proc at boot time. The fstab entry is correct
" /proc /proc proc defaults " but I must always hand mount /proc after boot. I 
am running linux on a 486/50Dx clone, 16 Mb of memory, and a A1542c with a 100 mb 
hard drive. Linux resides on the whole drive in one partition. I have no swap
because as I understand it, the FAQ says that I do not need it with the amount of
core memory I have on the system. So here are the symptoms :

        1. On boot-up I get the message "mount unchecked ext2 partition"
        2. In multi-user mode as root (or any user) I type df. It complains
        about /proc not being mounted. I mount it and df works but, it doesn't
        give stats on the / (sda1) partition.

                my fstab :
          /dev/sda1             ext2    defaults
          /proc         /proc   proc    defaults

        *** The sda1 entry  looks suspect but, I dont know enough about linux 
            to know what it should look like. Also after install the /proc
            entry was not there...I had to enter it in.

My Question - Did I screw up something during install ? Did linux screw up (i.e.
is there a patch for this problem) ? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Lance.

But have you tried bootutils-1.0 and svinit-2.4?  I use the mount & unmount 
from the former and the init and shutdown from the latter.  This combination 
seems to work.

Subject: [Q] Faircom c-tree Plus
Date: 2 Sep 1993 12:57:08 GMT

I am shopping for a b-tree/ISAM database management library to be
used under Linux.

One candidate is Faircom's c-tree Plus v6.0 D product. I have been
looking for demos of applications developed with this library, but to
no avail. The 'Demos' file area of the Faircom BBS is empty!

So my questions are:

Is anybody using c-tree Plus with linux? Any noteworthy experiences/
anecdotes/horror stories?

What performance can be expected? I would very much like to play with
a linux binary demo application. Failing that, a DOS demo would also
be very helpful.

Also, suggestions for other DBM libraries are most welcome.

Thanks.

Huh?  I'd say it would be worth it!  What do ya mean 'too great for Intel'?
Ever hear of the white hardware?  All the white hardware I've seen has been
Intel bassed and I hear it runs pretty well. 

I don't think the original poster meant that we should write NextStep for
Linux, but rather a shell around X that looked like NS.  Maybe call it NxS.
I'd be happy with the ability to do drag and drop in a file manager. Come to
think of it, I'd like a file manager. 

Having something that looked like NS would really boost the usability of
Linux A LOT. 

Someone wanna  work on this with me?

Yeah, but With NextStep at least i get an operating system worthy of the
hardware requirements.


NT is really a damn bust.  I saw NT on discount shelves at a computer sale
recently.  Store salescritter said he wasn't seliing any of them!  

Its been about three minutes since my last post on this subject, and I'm
getting more and more serious about doing something that looks like
nextstep.  

Anyone else interested?

Subject: Re: BBS package
From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)
Date: 11 Sep 93 12:50:22 PDT

Hello all,

As some of you know I've been working on developing a BBS under Linux for
a while now.  I thought I'd let y'all know what's new.

After bringing my C based BBS up to about %70 of what I want (need) it to
do, I've scratched it and started over.  What I'm now writing is a new
programming language called M-Script that is designed specifically for
writing BBS's and or MUD's.  I'm re-writing my BBS in M-Script.

M-Script is an interpreted language that looks very similar to dBase.  It
is very tightly written and is very fast (although I don't really have
anything to compare it to).  The interpreter executable is only 40K,
although that will grow a little bit as I add more commands, etc.

Why M-Script over regular shell scripts?  It's simply easier to write a
BBS in M-Script.  Little knowledge of UNIX and none of C is required.  I
also plan on porting it to DOS so that the scripts will run directly under
either Unix or DOS.  Also, with many Internet applications built in, you
have more control over how your (usually expensive) resources are used.

A prime example is FTP.  In M-Script you can give your users a menu of
files that are available, say, at sunsite.  They can tag all the ones they
want and those selections are saved (or retrieved immediately - whatever)
At midnight or so a cron job can be run that retrieves all the users'
files, and mails them a report of the transactions.  I think you get the idea.

Just some of the commands you find in M-Script include:

   ftpopen/ftpclose/ftpcd/ftpdir/ftpput/ftpget/etc: Built in FTP commands.

   mail: mail a file to someone.

   browse/cbrowse: Allows a user to view a file and scroll it in BOTH
   directions with the arrow keys, etc.  The 'c' version will interpret
   special codes in the file to manipulate colors, embed variables, etc.
   The non-c version does not interpret these codes.  An example line
   containing some of these codes might look like this:

   \tLWelcome to ISLAND-NET ~FIRSTNAME~!  You've called ~CALLS~ time\s before.
  
   The '\tL' sets the color to yellow, the ~FIRSTNAME~ is replaced by the
   value of the M-Script variable FIRSTNAME.  ~CALLS~ is replaced by the
   value of the CALLS variable.  The \s will print an 's' only if the last
   variable printed was not equal to '1'.  There are dozens of such codes
   that can be used.  Also, variables can be left or right justified, padded,
   etc.  For example: ~FIRSTNAME>30~ would display the value of FIRSTNAME
   right-justified in a 30 character space.

   list/clist: Allows the user to view a file in a more "traditional" manner.
   Kinda like the 'more' command - one screen or line at a time.  Again,
   the 'c' version interprets codes and variables.

   who: Displays a list of who's on the system.  You can customize the way
   this display looks by setting the WHOHEADER, WHOENTRY, and WHOFOOTER
   variables.

   finger: embedded finger command.  Works just like the real finger.

   print/cprint/nprint/ncprint: Display a line of text on the user's
   screen.  Again, the 'c' versions interpret codes.  The 'n' versions do
   not print a CR/NL after the text, the others do.

   shell: shell out and run some other program.  Useful if you want to
   run elm or tin or something...

   colors: turn ANSI colors on or off, or toggle the current value.

   pickone: allows the user to pick one value from a list of values.  For
   example, the statement 'pickone choice Yes,No,Maybe' would display the
   string 'Yes' on the user's screen.  When s/he presses the space bar, it
   changes to 'No', then to 'Maybe', then back to 'Yes', etc.  When the
   user presses enter the current value is stored into the variable 'choice'.

   input: read a line of text from the user and store it in a variable. 
   This allows full editing of the string with the arrow keys, etc.

   There are many many others that manipulate variables (case conversion,
   parsing, etc), manipulate the display (clear, cursor positioning, etc),
   manipulate files (delete, copy, move, rename, etc) and directories (cd,
   md, rd, etc).  It also has commands to open a file, read from it, search
   it, close it, etc.  There are some limited database like functions as
   well (I hope to expand the database commands quite a bit).

   For program flow M-Script currently can deal with while loops and
   if/elif/else statements.  Nesting is not a problem.  I plan on adding a
   switch/case command this week.  I'll probably add some sort of for loop
   as well.  Oh, you can also include another M-Script file with the
   "include" statement.

   Finally, M-Script allows you to define new procedures and call them
   throughout your program.  You can pass arguments to procedures, and
   procedures can return results.  The first procedure I wrote in M-Script
   was yesterday.  I called it PrintOut.  It takes a single filename as an
   argument.  The file is displayed on the screen on what looks like one
   of those green and white striped computer print outs (tractor feed
   holes, perforated edges, etc.)  The neat thing is I can call PrintOut
   at any time, giving any filename as an argument, and voila!  I need no
   special codes in the file at all - it's just plain ASCII.  This is just
   one example of what you can do with procedures.

   Miscellany: Every command can be abbreviated to the first 2-3 characters,
   supports comments (of course), some limited debugging (line echoing and
   statement stepping), etc.

Anyway, that's all I've got so far, but in a week or two M-Script should
be a pretty sophisticated language.  I'm always open to ideas and
constructive criticism.  Questions anyone?

In a week I'll be willing to give out a half dozen or so binaries of
M-Script to beta-testers, if anyone's interested.  Drop me a note.

Linux crashed and destroyed the hard disk partitioning table few days
ago.  After using a dos utility to rebuild the partitioning table I
was able to start up linux (sort of).  However, xdm did not came up
correctly as it used to.  And it messed up my screen to the extent
that I couldn't do anything but reboot.  

I have lilo installed.  Is that a way I could boot linux single user
so I could try to fix the problem or at least save some of my work.

I've got the tar file for ix/MBox for Linux on sunsite.unc.edu.

Fixed it up and it compiled.

The problem is that I created an anonymous user id called 'bbs'
so the public may dial in and use the BBS.

But for some reason, ix/MBox always uses the last user name when
logging in.

For example, I create a 'test user' on the BBS, then when I login
again via 'bbs', I get 'test user' back!

Anyone successfully running ix/MBox?
