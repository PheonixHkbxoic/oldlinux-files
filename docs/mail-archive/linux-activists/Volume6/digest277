Subject: A few problems with LINUX
Date: Thu, 30 Sep 1993 16:35:45 GMT


I just installed LINUX for the first time yesterday, and I've ran across
a few problems with it and my machine... maybe someone can give me a clue
to what's going on.

First of all, I tried to use LINUX with a 100MB partition, which it didn't
seem to like.  It complain that it wouldn't be able to use something like
70000 sectors, so I divided it up into two 50MB partitions.  What could
be the problem there?

Also, EVERY single time I boot LINUX, my keyboard is fried.....  it will
type approximately 3-4 characters each time I hit a key (ie.  it repeats
quite rapidly).  I thought it was typematic rate problem so I changed all
my CMOS settings to try and correct the problem, but it didn't seem to
help.  However, if I unplug my keyboard after LINUX has booted and then
plug it back in, then the keyboard is totally fine.

Anyone have any idea what that could be?

Thanks to all.

Date: Thu, 30 Sep 1993 17:41:06 GMT

Hi Linuxers,


I've installed lilo on my two-disk SCSI system on which i also run
(ran) OS/2 and occasionally DOS. LILO has installed itself on the
Master Boot Record and is unable to boot OS/2. It can, however,
occasionally boot OS/2's Boot Manager, but that seems to have 
crashed, why I dont know.

How do I boot OS/2 from LILO? OS/2 and Linux Swap is on disk 1
and Linux fs and DOS is on disk 2. I dunno where the MBR is,
presumably on disk 1, but DOS FDISK says the disk is not
startable and furthermore Linux FDISK and DOS FDISK swap
the drives such that /dev/sda == disk2 and /dev/sdb == disk2.

What's going on?

        Ouch! Did you enable kernel profiling when you compiled the kernel? 
If so, that's probably it; recompile without it if you want the kernel to be a 
more reasonable size. Kernel profiling takes a _*LOT*_ of RAM indeed!

(I know from what I heard on the net, and from personal experience! ;)

P.S. It would be a good idea to put this in the FAQ, since not many people 
are aware of it, and it does make such a difference, especially on machines 
with little RAM.

P.P.S. I'm moving this to comp.os.linux.help; comp.os.linux is being phased 
out. Follow-ups are directed to comp.os.linux.help.

VT beyond recovery, and you can't ALT-Fx to another one), and with the formula
and table creation features (which also use graphics mode). But overall, you
would have a real hard time finding something that gave you ALL the features

Watch out, though, the patches on tsx-11 DO NOT support the LU005S.  The

mcd-0.3 and modified them for the mcd.c and mcd.h that are in the pl13

[Various people ask about how to get their shell to work right, and in

The file /etc/profile is sourced by bash. Put things in here that everyone
will want to do (like setting a default path, etc.). Bash then looks in
your home directory for a file called .bash_profile and sources that on
login.

To find out how to write bash scripts, see the manual page for bash.

For example, to set an environment variable, you would write:

MYVAR=some_value
export MYVAR

Note that although /bin/sh is actually bash, bash looks at the name used to
invoke it and behaves differently depending on that name.

Brett,
If I remember correctly, the old NET2-FAQ, and the new HOWTO for NET2 give a DIP
script somewhere near the end of the document.  Some modems have trouble with the
'reset' command.  What I did to make the script reliably wake up my modem is added
a couple of lines right after the 'reset' command:
ATZ0\r\n
wait OK 3
Also note the old method of setting the remote and local IP addresses is changed in
the newer flavors of DIP.  You now have to use 'get $remote x.x.x.x' and 
'get local x.x.x.x' where 'x' is the appropriate IP address.  Other than that, the
script in the document seems to work for me.
Good Luck.

There are beta drivers that have been posted both for the Mitsumi CDROM
and for the streaming floppy tape devices.  The Mitsumi is a good addition
to the drivers, although it contributes to "kernel bloat" in many cases,
since the majority of people don't have a Mitsumi CDROM drive and thus
supporting it by default in an already tight-on-space kernel can be
argued to be a bad thing.

The Streaming floppy tape support is an altogether different issue, and is
based on some bad architectural choices by the designers of the devices.
The most serious of these, the timing constraints, almost invariably end
with drivers with buzz-loops in them for timing because the system clock
can not be trusted to force rescheduling sufficiently quickly, given its
10mS "tick" frequency (HZ for LBOLT is 100, in explict terms).

This tends to be bad; just like the original Archive/Computone tape
drivers for SCO systems, actively running the tape drive kills everything
else on the system as the tape driver buzz-loops so as to not miss its
timing window and nothing else is allowed to run.  Among other things,
this results in QIC-40/80 drives being totally useless for network
backup, and extremely slow because the archiving programs (like tar and
cpio) are not allowed to interleave their execution with that of the tape
drive -- nor is the disk driver, for that matter.

DOS doesn't have a problem with this because all DOS programs, by definition,
eat the machine.

The cannonical soloution is to either up the LBOLT clock resoloution to
1 or 2 mS (there is a 2.5mS timing window for a particular operation) and
add a real-time scheduling queue that gets exampined before all other run
queues.  This is the soloution taken by several UNIX variants, mostly those
with real-time extensions intrinsic to the OS.  This works, but is, all
things considered, an unsatisfactory approach, since timing differences
still must be resolved by buzz-looping at about 30% of your system (at 1mS
resoloution -- HZ=1000) or 60% of your system (HZ=500).

A more correct soloution is to move the lbolt clock to one of the other
clocks and use the current LBOLT clock (since it is a better clock) to
implement queued timer events for a high resoloution timer (the highest
resoloution event being used as the discriminator).  This allows the
driver to schedule processing a set interval after the last set of
processing, and in general will result in a vastly reduced system load.
Since the TQE's are resolved in kernel space, there is not an issue of
scheduling a user process at sufficient resoloution.

There are two other (minor) fixes that need to be implemented to complete
the "lowest overhead" scenario.  The first is to allocate a minimum of a
32k buffer in kernel space (again, like the Mitsumi driver, an expensive
proposition) to be used by the tape driver, and another 32k buffer as a
user-to-kernel transfer area (if you are willing to block the user process
in the driver, the second area is unnecessary assuming some even factor of
32k as the transfer block size).  The 32k buffer is then used for a single
continuous transfer without intervention; this will allow the driver to
stream on an unloaded system.

The next fix is related to the first, in that 32k is the minimum hunk to
allow timer initiated seeks or transfers within the second timing window
of 200mS.  The important point is that if data is not ready, the drive
can be kept happy without losing its place by issuing a seek operation
on 200mS boundries; it is critical that neither the "keepalive seek" or
the 2.5mS window require a particular process context to be active --
that is they should be kernel triggered events -- to minimize the impact
on the scheduler code.  Since this context may be swapped at the time
(being that it is in an I/O wait) this provides another rationale for the
second kernel transfer buffer.


Finally, no matter what implementation is used, it should be noted that each
vendor is not sufficiently constrained by the wording of the standard; this
means that it is nearly impossible to write a single driver that operates,
for instance, a Colorado Systems Jumbo 250, and some other vendors QIC-40/80
drive without rewriting, at a minimum, the initialization code.  This adds
a *large* amount of complexity to the project, namely because some vendors
believe that other vendors may want to adopt their way of doing things (fat
chance) and so won't let out programming info without non-disclosure... and
since source code constitutes disclosure... you get the drift.  It's exactly
the Diamond dot clock problem all over again.  Someone needs to hit the
hardware vendors over the head and tell them we don't care who can better
optimize boot code, it's how fast it runs that matters.

Just because something is ubiquitous, doesn't mean that it is standard...
QIC-40/80 drives are just the best example we have so far.

Yes, there is the problem -- the exit. When you exit kermit, it
drops dtr which hangs up the modem. If you don't want to "waste"
the shell that's running kermit, then after (or before) you
start term, suspend kermit -- at the kermit> prompt hit ctl-Z.
Then after you kill your term process, fg to get back to kermit
(you may have to CONnect back to the remote).

I always suspend kermit rather than running term (or rz/sz)
via !, so that I don't accidentally quit and drop my connection.
Instead I just have to remember there's a kermit in the background :-)
