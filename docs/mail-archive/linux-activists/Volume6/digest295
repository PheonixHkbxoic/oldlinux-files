Hm, I was convinced that I made a stupid beginner's mistake, but maybe
for once it is NOT me. 

My boot disk made by SLS does not work, either. I just installed the
last version of SLS ("0.99.12 #6 from August 10") and my boot floppy
(made at the end of the installation menu) stops right after saying

"Press <Return> to see SVGA modes available, <SPACE> to continue or
wait 30 secs

I waited for a LONG time (several minutes) but nothing happened.

I also tried to make a boot disk by the method described in the
"Installation Guide" book (great book, btw!), but this did not work,
either. For the record, I did the following (being root in /):

rdev zImage /dev/hda2            # ( I have a zImage in / )
mke2fs /dev/fd0 1440
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy   # I created a directory /floppy previously,
cp /zImage /dev/fd0              # although it does not seem to be used here
unmount /dev/fd0

This stopped with

Uncompressing Linux...

invalid compressed format

 -- System halted

I can boot the system by using the a1.3 disk, then booting in LILO
from /dev/hda2.

Can anybody tell me how I can make a floppy on which I can boot?

Thanks a lot!

Either you are missing /dev/mouse or it is a soft link pointing to

If your mouse is on "COM1" make it /dev/ttyS0 in Xconfig.

Date: Mon, 04 Oct 1993 08:45:40 +1000

i've installed linux into a 100mb partition on my hard disk for testing,
experimenting & configuring - when i'm happy with the way it works then it gets
the whole disk to itself...

details:

wangtek en5099-24 60MB tape drive
Wangtek PC-36 controller card (IRQ:5, DMA:1, PORT:300)
SLS 1.03 (series a,b,c disks only)

i can't get tar or mt to access the tape drive.  i've recompiled the kernel to
make sure that the qic-02 support is installed, and got rid of some of the
stuff i didn't need (like SCSI drivers, -m486 flag etc).  then i moved the old
/zImage to /old.zImage and copied the newly compiled zImage to /

i don't even see any message which could be the qic02 driver being loaded at
boot time.


i really don't know what to do next.

should i rm the /dev/rmt* and /dev/tape files, and then run /dev/MAKEDEV tapes
to re-mknod all the dev files?  I've already tried just mknod-ing a /dev/qtape
device but that didn't make any difference.



maybe this sort of stuff is in the Kernel Hackers Guide or the Systems
Administrator Guide from the Linux Doc Proj.  I've only got the install guide,
and it doesn't tell enough...it should be describing the directory structure in
more detail,  and the control/config files in particular rather than give yet
another mini tutorial on how to use sh

clues, anyone?

is there any way i can configure linux to use 80x43 rather than 80x50 line
VCs?

i find 43 line mode quite nice (a good compromise between amount of info on 
the screen, and how readable that info is), but 50 line mode is a bit of a pain
for the eyes.

(i guess the answer will be something like 'hack the kernel sources and add
another mode'....any tips on how to go about this would be appreciated :-)

note.  i am not using X.   at the moment, just the SLS 1.03 a, b, and c
series.

I am sure this has been asked over and over again, but here goes again:

I just got the latest version of Linux with Xwindows (from tsx-11.mit.edu)
and I installed it all, and when I type xinit, I can kinda see a window
on the screen, but it is about 5 times overlapped, and there is a bunch
of flickering.  I got a program called 'freq' from the same ftp site, 
however, I am not sure how to use, or what arguments it should take.

If someone has got a Speedstar 24x working with Xwindows (hopefully
in 1024x768), then please enlighten me via email....

I can't use it unless I'm root. If I'm logged on as a user, then it

When I asked this question several months ago, I got the answer that
one really must be root to do svgalib/vgalib program development.
This is a really big limitation as far as I'm concerned.  If you
wanted to, you could merely do an su to root and then change the owner
to root and mode to suid, thus spending less time in root.  But this
is still not too satisfactory...

Surely there is a better way.. Someone just has to make it up.

        But I think I can still help. I've heard that to get rid of zombies 
with portmap, recompiling portmap helps. I think I heard that you also have 
to make sure it either uses BSD signal, or properly uses the POSIX one. I 
think the zombies accumulate because of a SIGCHLD signal handler getting 
turned off after the first invocation.

P.S. Can anyone tell me why in g*d's name portmapper has to fork?

Ok, I have the manual for the speedstar, so I can find out exactly
what horizonatal and vertical timings I need (in KHz), but then I look
at the Xconfig file, and it wants to know a clock, and then for the
vertical and horiz. timings, it has four numbers, and I have no
idea what they mean..

e.g.

"1024x768i"  44    1024 1040 1216 1264    768 777 785 817

                      horizontal               vertical

now, in the manual, this is what I get for that res.

35.5 khz for Horizontal Sync and 43 Hz for Vertical Sync,

I dont see how the two tables really match?

Any one help me get this working?

The problem is that you need to have the PROC FileSystem installed and
initialized.  Try typing the following from the command prompt:

mount -t proc /proc /proc

If this works, then your problem is solved.  It can be fixed perminantly
by adding the appropriate line to /etc/fstab.

I know that it is possible, as I have a machine here that can run MSDos,
Windows NT and Linux with no problem.

What I have not figured out how to do is to have all 3 opoerating 
systems be avilable from a single boot menu. The NT boot system can
boot any number of NT installations, and at most one DOS partition.
I supose that the DOS partition could have a method of booting either
DOS or Linux; however I just have a floppy boot disk for Linux when
I want to run it.  I have not spent time to see if NT could be booted
from a mechanism other than its own boot loader.

No, it's not possible.  Novell treats the details of their protocols as a
