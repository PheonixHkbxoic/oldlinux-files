nope, thats the whole reason for term, you don't need SLIP.

X-windows runs alright under it on a 9600 baud modem - as long as you don't

many things are, and don't forget that term can let you have as many
windows open to the server as you want.

You are right, the NE2100 is nothing at all like the NE2000.

The LANCE driver in pl13 was written for an AT1500, but I tried to make it
general enough to work with the NE1500 and NE2100.  It should work without
changes, including autoprobe in {0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360} and autoIRQ.  The
default DMA channel is DMA5 -- I haven't yet decided if autoDMA is a good
idea.

Please post a followup article detailing your experience.

6 Possible Problems, Questions and Troubleshooting.

        This section tries to answer any unresolved questions, and not so
        common solutions to common problems.

6.01 Problem with NE2000 Clones -- "DMA address mismatch"

        Is the chip a real NatSemi 8390? (DP8390, DP83901, DP83902 or DP83905)?
        If not, some clone chips don't correctly implement the transfer
        verification register.  MS-DOS drivers never do error checking, 
        so it doesn't matter to them.

        Are most of the messages off by a factor of 2?
        If so:  Are you using the NE2000 in a 16 bit slot?
                Is it jumpered to use only 8 bit transfers?
        The Linux driver expects a NE2000 to be a 16 bit slot.  A NE1000 can
        be in either size slot.  This problem can also occur with some clones,
        notably D-Link 16 bit cards, that don't have the correct ID bytes
        in the station address PROM. [[ This should be fixed in pl12.]]

        Are you running the bus faster than 8Mhz?
        If you can change the speed (faster or slower), see if that
        makes a difference.  Most NE2000 clones will run at 16Mhz, but
        some may not.  Changing speed can also mask a noisy bus.

        What other devices are on the bus?
        If moving the devices around changes the reliability, then you
        have a bus noise problem -- just what that error message was
        designed to detect.  Congratulations, you've probably found the
        source of other problems as well.

6.02 Problem with NE2000 Clones -- Machine Hangs during Boot.

        Problem:  The machine hangs during boot right after the "8390..."  or
                  "WD...." message.  Removing the NE2000 fixes the problem.

        Solution: Change your NE2000 base address to 0x360 (or 0x340 for
                  pl12 or later kernels.)

        Reason:   Your NE2000 clone isn't a good enough clone.  An active 
                  NE2000 is a bottomless pit that will trap any driver
                  autoprobing in its space.  The other ethercard drivers take
                  great pain to reset the NE2000 so that it's safe, but some
                  clones cannot be reset.  Clone chips to watch out for: 
                  Winbond 83C901.  Changing the NE2000 to a less-popular
                  address will move it out of the way of other autoprobes, 
                  allowing your machine to boot.  

        Problem:  The machine hangs during the SCSI probe at boot.

        Solution: It's the same problem as above, change the 
                  ethercard's address.

        Problem:  The machine hangs during the soundcard probe at boot.

        Solution: No, that's really during the silent SCSI probe, and it's
                          the same problem as above.

I got it to work directly out of the install -- no problems.  Of course I
got X to run with tab - or whatever the default window manager was before
I changed it to mwm.  Did you untar it from the exact directory specified
in the docs so that everything ends up where it is supposed to?

Assuming the 34F is one of the supported UltraStor cards (and I don't
think all of them are), I'd say to play with any IRQs or other hardware
settings you can change. You might, for instance, want to temporarily
pull the MFM controller and see if that makes any difference.

There are only few of the "fancier" Boot Managers which allow booting from
Active Partitions on a Second Hard Drive (I do not believe Linux's fdisk
has the potential).  What I have successfully done on my system (with its two
SCSI Hard Drives), is install Linux (Slackware 1.0.3) on the second drive
(leaving the DOS and Interactive Partitions on the first drive untouched)!
I am restricted to booting from the LILO Boot disk which Slackware's 
Setup Program generated for me.  Sounds like your's are IDE Drives, I do not
know if the same will work (but we are planning to attempt the same thing
on an IDE based based machine next week).

If you try the LILO Boot Disk "trick" can you let me know your results.  We are
planning to do the same with a 210 Meg WD and a 200 Meg Maxtor (both IDE, the
Maxtor will be the slave, DOS is already on the WD)?

        If you ran it without installing it, results will be unpredictable
        since the headers tell it where to find stuff.  It probably went
        after runscript (in usr/local/bin by default or keyserv (in usr/
        local/etc and came up empty-handed.

        NO! go ahead and create a /usr/local/bin as well as a /usr/local/lib
        and a /usr/local/etc if you don't already have them!  You're gonna
        need 'em in the future anyhow, and it'll make life a lot easier to
        have them around.  Also, from an aesthertics point of view, it
        is nicer to keep application stuff away from systems stuff - upgrades
        then become far less annoying. ;-)

        Hope this explains some things. - Mark
