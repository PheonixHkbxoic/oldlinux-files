Looks PERFECT to me :-)

Let me try to explain the mem-lines from free an top (correct me if I'm wrong):
a)  13840K +  1124K = 14964K
b)  13840K - 10688K =  3152K
c)   3152K -  1928K =  1224K

(a) total_mem = used_mem + free_mem : no memory is 'lost' (kernel-space is
    already subtracted from your physical memory size to give total_mem)
(b) used_mem - buffer_mem = memory used by existing processes (process_mem)
    where buffer_mem is used as a dynamic disk-cache
(c) process_mem - shared_mem = private memory for the all processes, i.e.
    memory that is neither shared-executable-pages (for multiple instances of
    the same executable, like getty or sh, that share some (read-only) pages)
    nor shared libraries.

Sigh, I wish people could really READ the output-lines from free, top et al. up
to the last character... As long as total_mem=free_mem+used_mem there is really
nothing to worry about (buffers count as used memory !!!).
Hey, enjoy, the kernel has put your expensive memory in use, no chips wasting
your money by not being used at all :-)) (Sorry, couldn't resist...)
Maybe this should be in the FAQ (if it isn't already). But who actually reads
FAQs ? I usually don't as you can see ;-)

I hope this puts an end to this 'help, the kernel has a memory leak' stuff...

I am trying to build a Linux system on my new Toshiba 4600.  It has an 
ethernet adapter installed via the PCMCIA slots. 

Has anybody already done something similar, and where can I get the relevant 
driver?

The actual card I have is an AST card; although if you look inside it says its
an IBM NIC card.

Any replies to me should be by e-mail, and I will post a summary of the

I have an Infotel 14.4K baud modem (internal) set at com3 (irq4).  When trying 
to access the modem with anything (kermit, minicom, pcomm) I get the reply 
"can't open /dev/modem.  Device busy."  I've also tried setting the programs 
to look directly at /dev/cua2 and /dev/ttyS2, but still the same results.  A 
local person suggested re-linking the /dev/modem to each /dev/cuaX (where X is 
0 - 3) and seeing what happened.  I still got the same results on cua2, but on 
cua1 i would get nothing (no negative response) since this is my mouse, cua0 
would say it was busy also.

Does anyone have another suggestion to try?

I have had similar problems with a Diamond Stealth, XS3.0.4 server, SLS1.03,
XFree 1.3, etc.

1.  I fixed it by getting the Slackware Distribution from
    ftp.cdrom.com  (/pub/linux/slackware).  The problem DID NOT recur.

2.  I'm not sure of the effectiveness, but I heard you can get Linus'
    kernel source and rebuild it.  This apparently solves the problem.


It seems the common link is SLS.  Is that an accurate assumption????
Best bet is to get Slackware.  It worked for me.

I had the exact same problem with my Future Domain controller.  Mine was
using the 18C50 chipset instead of the more standard 1850.  After waiting
a few weeks...I tried the latest Slackware distribution.  Apparently
this chipset is now supported and I am up and running Linux!!!!

If you can't get another controller...hang in there try to find some SCSI

Nope!  You *do* need to reboot in order to be completely safe.  The
trouble is that you can't completely unmount the root filesystem; if
you try to do so, the filesystem still hangs around afterwards in a
read-only state.  So, you can't flush out any inode information that
the kernel may have cached about the filesystem.

Because of this danger that the kernel may have cached out-of-date
filesystem information, it is dangerous to let the kernel write to the
root filesystem after it has been fixed by fsck.  That's why a reboot
is necessary in such a situation.  However, there should be no harm in
continuing the boot process if it was a filesystem other than root
which was repaired.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

It's really a matter of personal taste.  The HJ boot disks use xiafs
as standard but SLS uses ext2fs.  As an ext2fs developer I am
naturally biased towards ext2fs, but they are both perfectly decent
filesystems.  All my tests show that ext2fs has a consistent
performance advantage over xiafs, but I have heard reports from other
users who claim xiafs is a little faster.  Certainly, neither is much
slower than the other, although I believe ext2fs does suffer less from
long-term fragmentation.

ext2fs has several extra features.  It has fast symbolic links, and
backs up superblock information to aid recovery in case of a bad
filesystem crash.  It has a more powerful fsck, which is capable of
recovering information after a crash which would be permanently lost
on other filesystems.  e2fsck still has a couple of problems in the
case of really severe filesystem corruption, but in these cases most
other fsck's would simply fail to recover any of the lost data at all.
A new, faster and more powerful e2fsck program, as well as a fs
debugger to allow you to manually try to repair ext2fs partitions, are
under development and are now in alpha testing.

ext2fs also supports large sized filesystem blocks, and fragments for
efficient allocation of space should be implemented in the future.  I
am working on adding transparent compressed file support to ext2fs.
This is the real difference between ext2fs and xiafs - ext2fs has been
designed to grow.

Under constant use, both ext2fs and xiafs appear to be stable.  I know
of only one bug(let) in xiafs, and none in ext2fs right now.  There
are some filesystem problems occasionally attributed to xiafs and
ext2fs, but these usually seem to be associated with either the quota
patches (there seems to be some interference between the quota system
and the filesystem unmounting code), and SCSI/Net interactions (it
appears that under very high load, the combined DMA traffic incurred
by running a high-performance SCSI card with DMA networking at the
same time can sometimes cause the system motherboard's refresh cycles
to get delayed to the point where memory corruption can start).

Ultimately, it's up to you... :-)

Cheers,
 Stephen.

That's not really true, you are limited by the PID slots, if you have

i want c , c++ and X ... no net nor tex (have net and tex at university :)

i tried to download HJ gccdisks but couldn't find them :(
same for the libdisks ... what happens to them ???
are they being upgraded ?? or the site (well .. sites ... tried tsx and sunsite)
run out of disk space??

please tell me what can i do ... i think installing HJ disks and tinyX
are the best choice ... what do you think ??

i'm not a unix wizard , but i know (i think) very well unix ... 
well .. as a user at least :)


i tried to mail to H.J. , but the mail returned to me with a User unknown

thanks in advance

Cristian

Rather than argue the merits of spending more money, I'd like just
one reason why someone couldn't set up a special disk for this person
to use?  He'd need a root disk, and a way to boot the kernel, but I
see no reason that this can't be accomplished with existing tools.

Alex (If I read the attrib right), how much memory do you have?  This
is an important question, as linux requires either 1.5 or 2 Meg, I'm
not sure which.  Second, how much disk space can you give
to linux?  would you have any problems making a partition of, say 20
Meg, and having about 1 Meg of stuff on your dos partition at the same
time?

Be aware, this will not be easy, as none of the packages will install
from a 360K floppy, but I'm sure we can get you up.  Also let me know
if you have any unusual hardware.  Once we get you up, you can install
standard SLS stuff by copying it to your hard disk and installing it
from there.  It's just that first step that's difficult (actually,
only getting the root partition is hard, you can easily boot off a
360K floppy).

I realize I'm basically volunteering here to do a lot of work to
benifit very few people (how many 386 machines have 2 Meg of ram but
only a 360K floppy?), but I don't like "spend more money" answers when
someone wants to try something out.
