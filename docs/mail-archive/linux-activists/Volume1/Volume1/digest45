Subject: icon coexpressions; ka9q progress
Date: 9 Feb 92 18:27:53 GMT

Somebody asked how I managed to get coexpressions working in icon.
Originally I said I didn't: the default configuration comes without
them.  However it turns out that the application program I wanted to
run requires them.  So I tried using rswitch.c from the i386_sysv
configuration, and it worked fine.  I've now got Richard Goerwitz'
"bibleref" working.  It's a bit slow, presumably because I'm using a
386sx, but it's usable.

Since there were several people asking about icon, it's probably worth
uploading it at this point, though floating point is still not
working, and the program library fails a few of the self-tests.  But
Bibleref is a pretty substantial program, and since it works, the port
is probably in fairly good shape.

I feel fairly odd talking about porting ka9q, since somebody already
announced that he had done a port.  But he hasn't responded to
questions about it, so for the moment I have no way of knowing what
has already been done.  He said it was a simple port, so I'm assuming
he's done a minimal port of the 1989 code -- the alternatives don't
meet my criteria for "simple".

I have ka9q working over compressed SLIP.  Indeed I'm working over a
telnet connection now, and I just downloaded several MB of data using
FTP.  I started with the old 1989 Unix port -- which seemed like the
easiest to port -- and retrofitted compressed SLIP from the December
1991 NOS version.  Before I unleash it on the world, I'm probably
going to retrofit bootp as well.  There are still two problems:

  (1) the tty line sometimes hung.  I've seen this on my machine
        under DOS as well.  It happens on enough machines that
        FTP, Inc now does timeouts in their SLIP code.  I put
        similar code into the serial device handler.  The current
        form is a real hack.  I think Linus is going to look at
        a cleaner way of doing it.  I haven't had any hangs since
        putting in the timeout.  (The apparent problem is
        dropping serial output interrupts.)

  (2) as far as I can tell, timeouts in select don't work.
        It looks to me like select.c is doing the wrong thing
        when transferring that argument.  Thus at the moment
        I'm using non-blocking I/O.  The program simply sits
        in a loop looking for input from the keyboard or serial
        port.  This tends to slow things down for any other
        programs that may be running.  I'd like to get this
        working a bit better, but I'm not sure I'm going to have
        time this weekend.

ANSI requires that realloc() should act just like malloc() if it is passed a
NULL pointer.  Someone else has already pointed out that ANSI also requires
free() to behave sensibly when passed a NULL pointer.  Given these two facts,
you should have no problems if the library is correct unless you dereference
the pointer.

It seems I can't mount.
When I installed Linux everything went fine. I mounted a partition from
hd and moved rootimage to it and I could boot with it.
If I try to mount another hd partition or floppy I get only
'mount: error 2.' (Yes, I used mkfs and mknod before I tried mount)
Any ideas what went wrong?

From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
Subject: Lock-ups, init/login
Date: 9 Feb 92 19:12:22 GMT

Ok, there has been some talk about lock-ups with linux: notably when
doing big compiles (linking gnu-emacs etc) or when having several
programs running under the VC's.  The only solution has been to reboot
with ctrl-alt-del, and this has mostly resulted in a more-or-less
destroyed filesystem (the problem is compounded by the fact that these
lock-ups happen just when you are running the most memory-intensive
programs, which often write to the disk as well). Happily this doesn't
happen very often (I haven't got many reports about this).

As far as I've been able to find out, the problem isn't a filesystem
problem (directly that is: the filesystem is just the first casualty
after a reboot) - it seems to be directly linked with memory usage. 
When linux gets low in memory, it doesn't just give up and terminate the
process: it tries to swap things out (even on a nonswapping system it
can swap executable pages out - they can be demand-loaded back when
necessary).

This is mostly good: it allows programs to run to completion even after
the memory really got totally used up, but it doesn't cope too well with
programs that don't want "just a couple more pages", but a /lot/ of
them: it might eventually give up with a "out of memory" error and
terminate one of the processes, but it seems linux stubbornly tries to
run some programs when it thinks it can juggle the pages, but in reality
the program is just totally trashing between 2 or more pages (one single
machine-insns can result in several page exceptions). 

Even update doesn't get the time to run, and the result is a machine
that seems totally dead, and won't sync.  Not good (understatement of
the year).  If somebody (who knows about swapping etc) has some
constructive ideas of how to solve the problem, I'd be interested: right
now I don't want to release 0.13 before this is solved.  My current idea
is to look at which pages have recently been swapped out, and if linux
notices that one page gets swapped out/in all the time, it just kills
the process.  I'll get it solved: I just wanted to warn people that this
problem does exist. 

Then over to other things:
> floating point with gcc.

Yes, gcc floating point stinks (not gcc's fault).  The library is
incomplete (doesn't even handle add with floats, you have to use
doubles), but there are better times ahead: hlu@eecs.wsu.edu re-ported
gcc without the soft-float hack needed for earlier versions of linux,
and I hope all the problems will go away: people with 387's will finally
get to use them automatically, and the kernel 387-emu should make it
possible to run the same programs (albeit not that efficiently) without
any ugly soft-float libraries.  The first reports seem positive. 

> init/login.

Oh, well: I asked this before, and I even got some replies. Sadly I've
misplaced most of them. I have one init/login by poe@xxx.xxx, and that
will be the one I use unless somebody else comes up with something even
better. If you think you have the ultimate (well...) init/login, mail me
about it (preferably with a subject like: "init/login"): tell me how to
get it, what it does, and possible problems.

Subject: fix to select timeouts
Date: 10 Feb 92 00:15:40 GMT

In order to make ka9q give optimal response without killing all other
activities on the system, I have to use select.  (However I'm using it
in a different place than the original KA9Q source had it.  Somebody
wasn't being very creative.)  Unfortunately, select's timeout feature
doesn't work.  The fix is very simple.  I'm including the diff here,
though I'm also putting it in athos:/pub/linux/select.patch, just so
it gets onto the distribution systems.  (Note that there's another
patch to select also, with the Emacs source code.)

It always appeared to me that 30 characters was good enough for anything.

The real problem here is that you want to encode outside of the file a
commentary on the contents of the file.  Encoding that commentary in a
very long string of letters (remember, no spaces :-) is wrong wrong
wrong.

There was a desktop info manager in Xerox Parc in the 70's that had
a separate notes file for each regular file.  It was append-only,
and every appended text item included an automatic timestamp.
I've always wanted this.

     The appropriate action for malloc(0) is probably to fail with an
assert(size > 0) failure.  Since there's much disagreement over what
should happen (some systems treat malloc(0) as equivalent to malloc(1),
some return null) it's probably better to know that the calling program
is doing something likely to lead to trouble than to guess wrong and
create an obscure bug.

Hi there.
I'm trying to get Linux working, and it does start-up fine on my 386DX 16
Mhz with the WD MFM Controller, but when I try it with my 386DX 25 Mhz
with a DTC RLL AT controller it has a kernel panic.
Just after the question asking Svga modes, at says 
"Kernel panic: HD controller not ready".
Why? (Oh, Coherent works fine on this machine, not sure about Minix)

Another question..
Is there anywhere I can FTP to that has archives of alt.os.linux?
I'd like to gather all the posts, but the Newsgroup setup here doesn't keep
alt groups around very long.

Thanks in advance...

Subject: What happens when one mkfs's ones DOS partition? (*gulp*)
Date: 10 Feb 92 04:09:19 GMT

While trying to install linux, it turns out I ran mkfs over my dos
partition (which was /dev/hd2 for some reason; /dev/hd1 seems to be
unused).  Obviously, I couldn't boot after that.

But I booted from a floppy, tried SYS C: and then almost all of C: was
back.  CHKDSK told me two of my subdirectores were bad, converted them
to files, and I delted them.  Next I restored those two subdirectores
from a backup.  Now I can boot, and CHKDSK doesn't complain.

Can someone who understands things like parition tables and mkfs
please tell me how likely it is that I've cured the damage done by
mkfs?  Many thanks in advance.   (And if you have some extra time, I'd
love to know what exactly it is I'm >doing< when I mkfs, mount, etc.)

Subject: Screen 3.2 on comp.sources.misc

A pretty spiffy multi-screen manager was just posted to comp.source.misc.
It manages multiple sessions and screenfuls via running shells under
pseudo-ttys.  If you rewrote it to paint video RAM directly you could
could grab X fixed-size fonts and have various sizes of screen for
different sessions.

I've used a DOS editor called 'sled' that did its own screen painting
with a bit-mapped font under Hercules, and going from 25 lines to 42
was well worth the smaller letters and the repaint time was not
noticeable offensive.

I've put KA9Q on athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux, as ka9qbin.tar.Z and
ka9qsrc.tar.Z.  The READ.ME in the binary is as much documentation as
I have.  This is the pre-NOS version, with compressed SLIP and bootp
retrofitted.  The only major missing feature is the domain name
server.  I ran out of time.  I also suspect it might be better to port
NOS rather than spend more time on this version.

Unfortunately, this depends upon at least two kernel patches:
nonblocking I/O and the select fix posted earlier today.  Also, on my
machine I've seen the serial output hang when using KA9Q.  serial-hang
is a workaround for this.  I believe Linus is working on a better fix.
Mine is sort of questionable if you have more than one serial line.

I've tried to do the best I can with performance tuning.  I use
select, but in a way different than the optional select support in the
original code.  I'm getting as good response as with the version that
sits there in a continuous loop waiting for input, but it doesn't use
as much CPU.

I've only tested this is a SLIP configuration.  It's unlikely to be
useful with Ethernet, as that requires kernel support.  It might work
with the AX25 and other stuff that sits on a serial line, though my
patches could conceivably have broken something.  If so, the fix
shouldn't be major

I'm not sure where to get documentation for this version.  the READ.ME
in the binary version has a list of commands, but that's no
substitute for real documentation.

   OK, enough already! Thanks to all those who replied; I now understand all
about long file names!

   I guess I could see the uses of longer filenames before I posted the
original message; what I DIDN'T know about was the filename completion
available with the TAB key in bash. The book I have on Unix, while otherwise
quite useful, is really about Berkeley Unix and doesn't seem to mention
filename completion at all. I suppose the man page on bash talks about it, but
I haven't read it all (who reads documentation anyway?).

   Changing the subject (nothing up my sleeve ...), I get strange problems
using Linux v0.12 (BTW, is it pronounced line'-ux or linn'-ux?). One problem
occurs when I've been working in a subdirectory (eg to compile mtools), then
remove all files in the directory, go up a level, and try to rmdir the
subdirectory. Linux will often refuse, claiming I'm not the owner. Now as
far as I understand it, the superuser should be able to do most anything, so
it does seem abnormal. Using chmod to change the file permissions doesn't
seem to make much difference either -- the permissions get changed, but I
still can't remove the directory. If I either reboot or logout, I can remove
the directory with no problems. What's going on?

that paging up and down (Ctrl-v / ESC-v) causes the bottom highlighted

I disagree completely.  This isn't pathological, it's common sense.
I believe stdio is required to flush stdout before reading stdin.
