Well, finally at least one person agrees with me :-)

Here's another example of why I find it annoying that malloc(0) is treated as
a special case of malloc(N) - it makes it more difficult to cleanly handle
arrays whose size is computed at run time. Consider:

/* process an array of N `Things' */
function(Thing x[], int N)
   {
   /* say we need to stash away a copy of x[] for awhile */
   Thing *stash = malloc(N * sizeof(Thing));
   
   /* check for out of memory (oops, must handle special case of N==0) */
   if (!stash && N) error();

   /* fill the array */
   for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) stash[i] = x[i];
   
   /* then sometime later (oops, must handle special case of N==0) */
   if (stash) free(stash);
   }

Ok, I'll stop beating a dead horse. Judging from some of the (surprisingly
obnoxious) messages in my mailbox, I seem to be in the minority on this
issue. 

flame on...
Some people seem to feel that any mail originating from an IBM gateway must 
be from some guy who just climbed off a 370 mainframe. Hey, believe it or 
not, there ARE people here who grew up on unix (real unix, not just AIX),
love it as much as you do, and depend on it for all their work.
So don't pre-judge ok?

I went through much the same experience with installing the lp patches a few
days ago, except when I rebooted with the new kernel, it worked!  The lp-init
code announced that it had found lp0 and lp2.  When I took a copy of this new
kernel to a friend's laptop computer, it did not find his printer port, de-
spite the fact that it was there.  My suspicion is that the code for finding
a parallel port is not sufficiently general.  It works on some machines only.

>Could my problem be my partitions?  I had thought that if I had used
>Minix' fdisk I wouldn't have any problems.

What does fdisk under Linux say?  I recently partitioned a big IDE
drive, and found the results from using the Minix fdisk hard to make
sense of.  That is, I would make partitions, and Minix would say they
were fine, but fdisk under Linux would see partition sizes with no
obvious relationship to the size I had set.

I think it would be helpful to write an fdisk under Linux.  I wanted
two 64M partitions, and had the following problems:

  minix fdisk - resulting sizes under linux fdisk looked completely 
        unrelated to reality
  DOS 5.0 fdisk - limited to one primary partition, and of course
        linux wants its own primary partitions
  DOS 3.2 fdisk - refused to make partitions over 32MB, or to
        place them anywhere other than the beginning of the disk.
  edpart - tended to hang whenever I tried to get it to do something
        I couldn't get the DOS fdisks's to do.

I finally used fdisk from Microport's SV/AT (a port of System V
release 2 for the PC AT).  I suspect this is not a solution for most
people.  (I don't actually have SV/AT installed at the moment.  All I
had to do was boot the installation floppy.  It has fdisk.)  This is
the only version of fdisk that does what you really want: you can make
paritions anywhere, of any size, and for each choose whether it's a
DOS partition (produces an old-style primary DOS partition) or a Unix
partition.  I'm not sure what to tell people with big disks who don't
own SV/AT.

Subject: another dead filesystem and that fsck can't fix
Date: 2 Feb 92 20:28:48 GMT

I'm a victim of what is probably the same problem somebody reported a
bit ago: I have a directory that fsck complains doesn't have . and ..
at the beginning.  Whenever I try to look anyhthing in it, the kernel
panics, claims it's trying to deallocated 0.  fsck reports an error,
but doesn't do anything about it.

I can probably rebuild the file system, but it's a pain.

By the way, it's now pretty clear that there's a timing problem (a
race or something) in the file system or hd code.  Basically whenever
I am doing file system I/O in two jobs at the same time (e.g. on two
screens), I lose.  Examples: copying a large file from MSDOS to linux,
using mread.  At the same time I log in on a different screen, which
does a bit of I/O (the login program, init files for bash).  The
system hung.  Or extracting from a large tar file and simultaneously
doing ls and du to see how things are progressing.  My disk is fairly
fast (it's one of the new Connor IDE disks, which I believe is 8 msec
average seek).  Perhaps it turns up race conditions not seen with
slower disks.

This makes the system sort of dangerous to use, given that fsck won't
fix it.  Even a way to manually remove the directory would be welcome.

Subject: simple way out of fs problem
Date: 2 Feb 92 21:00:17 GMT

What I did to recover my file system was pretty simple: patch the
kernel so that the superuser can unlink directories, and then unlink
the bad directory.  Of course this leaves orphan files, but fsck can
fix that.

I recommend 
  - having an option for fsck to remove bad directories
  - making the file system code not panic when it has a directory
        without . and ..
  - fixing the underlying file system bug that causes the system
        to hang when doing a lot of file system activity

By the way, I tried to use the Minix fsck.  This is with version
1.3 of Minix, if that matters.  It claimed there was a bad file
system superblock, and so wouldn't do anything.

Ok, I thought: somebody has some installation problem, and this isn't a
real bug. But I tried it out anyway: just in case. And lo and behold, it
corrupts the program. So I got a little nervous: this seemed like a
really fundamental bug. Time for some source-checking.

Half an hour later I still hadn't found the kernel bug: I found a
race-condition in the fork(), and corrected that one, but it wasn't very
bad, and the program still crashed. Now I started to panic: it might be
some weird bug in the memory manager - most programs exec right efter
the fork. But no, no bug that I could see. That's when I decided to take
a look at the program...

>    int pid, i;
[ deleted ]
>           wait(pid);

That's not how wait works (and it would have been checked by gcc if you
had included unistd.h), and this just results in the exit value being
written to an address determined by the pid of the child.  So the fault
was in the program all the time, and people using linux can once more
breathe more easily (but boy did I get worried! :). 

Moral of the story: check your bug-reports as this kind of thing is kind
of silly, BUT I'd rather see these kind of reports than none at all:
this "bug" meant I found a real one that could bite somebody in the
future (it wasn't very probable: the race-codition only happened when
linux was out of memory and started paging, AND several processes tried
to fork at once).

I have just installed the swapon and lp patches from tsx-11.  The
kernel recompiles successfully and I get a lp-init message
when I try to use the lp device I have mknoded, nothing prints
and I get the EACCES error.

When I try to use swapon (I have make a swapfile), it exits with
error # 99.  The actual size of the swapfile and the size mkswap
reported when I make the swapfile were different.  could this be
the problem? 

any help with either of these problems would be appreciated.

While cawf was really easy to setup and use,  I am having a weird problem
with it under linux.  Using it to format one of its own man pages results
in an output that is not indented far enough (it's one space short of the
pre-formatted pages).  However, compiling the same code under SunOS works
fine.  Anyone else have this problem?

   I have also wondered about this.  It shouldn't be too difficult if you 
look through the console driver code to set the mode to something lower
(I have given this code a slight looking over, but don't have time to go
searching through it in depth).  I also have an ATI card and would much
perfer the 80 column mode because so many things are limited to that any-

Anybody got time to go and do this?  If nobody does within a week or so I
may give it a look when I have more time.

The reason that vi works is that it does much of it's own terminal processing.
I can't really suggest any reasons (or solutions) for your problem as I
don't know your system.  Have you tried reseting your terminal?  Some Unixes
have 'reset' or 'tset' or 'setterm' commands that might do the trick.  If
you are connected to a workstation with X you can try this under csh:
        eval `resize`
It will probably give an error message or so, but it usually manages to 
determine the correct terminal size for me.  Good luck.

Neither.  POSIX doesn't define what numbers the signals correspond to
--- programs are expected to #include <signal.h> and use the symbolic
names.  Programs that don't do this deserve everything they get.  
(Although most OS implementations would be fools to move certain
standard ones, like 1, 4, and 9, since users often will type the numbers
for those kill commands: "kill -9 562", for example).

Similarily, POSIX doesn't require that SIGBUS and SIGSYS be defined, so
on Linux, they aren't.  Programs that try to trap them should probably
surround their call like this:

#ifdef SIGBUS
        signal(SIGBUS, allocate_more_memory);
#endif
