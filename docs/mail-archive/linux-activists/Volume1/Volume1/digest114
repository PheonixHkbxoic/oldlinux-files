Long woeful story followed by short query :-

story:
        After major hassles trying to recompile the 095 kernel with 
the patches for ps. after getting swapping going, and finding out 
about uncommenting the -fcombine-regs in the makefiles, things still 
weren't working. I came to the conclusion that I had somehow got
bits of two incompatible /usr/include/... directories mixed together.
        To fix this I completely removed all trace of gcc and 
installed newgcc from scratch. I then attempted to do a make all
from /usr/src/linux - all proceeded well until the make reached 
tools/build.c here it spat because some include files were missing.
Adding "-Iinclude" to the compile options for build helped, but 
limits.h is still missing. I expected it to be in linux/include, 
but no banana there ... 

Query:
        So, firstly, where do I find limits.h? And secondly am
I doing things completely arse-about or is my approach basically
correct ?

Please post replies - this is a borrowed login - thankx.

I, 'boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu', am willing to be the 'U.S.' mail 
receiver of 'ideas/wishes' to include into the 'beginner's guide to
Linux/Unix' specifically for those coming from the DOS world into
Linux. I will put together papers which I will submit to the newsgroup
and what is acceptable will hopefully be made available on ftp sites.

I will include /bin binaries explanations, file-for-file, suggestions
for running Linux from a floppy only system, for trial use, setting
up the hard disk partitions (what programs to use from what is available),
using mtools, being a sysadministrator all of a sudden with given
responsibilities, shell usage, etc.... all understandable by DOS users.

So, since the chap in U.K. has a bouncing line, I will avail myself
this side of the Atlantic/Pacific to receive these mails of suggestions.

It seems to me that a great combination would be Taylor UUCP, Elm, and
Smail 2.5.  Smail 2.5 is small and fast, and could be set up with a
minimal "paths" file that just points to your smart host.

Hello linuxoids,

Some abnormalities: Linux 0.12 detects my Paradise plus16 card ok but if I try and use any mode beyond 25x80 then everything goes south suddenly after about  10 minutes, even if I have done nothing at all.

After using Kermit to transfer a file from my schools Vax, my keyboard is remapped to return control keys only; really a drag because if I could get comms working well I could forget about DOS for the most part (rawrite and all that jazz).
Any suggestions?
Hardware:
33mhz 386 8 megs & 387
Future Domain tm871 SCSI controller
wd wd2 1003 cotroller for mfm linux drive (I flip-flop cmos to choose OS)

I've been working on making the root diskette (yes, still :), and I
have a few questions/comments to throw out at people:

-       I'd like to change the naming of tty6[4567] to be ttys[1234].
        It's easier to remember, and makes it clear those are serial
        devices.  (This is a random thought:  Does anyone have a
        printer running off a serial port?  Can Linux talk to it
        through the serial port?)  Also, before someone asks about my
        including tty66 and tty67, Linus has indicated there will be
        some support for all four serial ports.  ttys[13] and ttys[24]
        share the same IRQ, though, so that might not be too reliable.

        (I'm assuming that for those of us with ttys[34] on alternate
        IRQs, it will just be a quick kernel patch, but I haven't seen
        the new serial drivers.)

-       Just in general, who should be the owner, what should be the
        group, and what should be the permissions for the /dev files,
        the /etc files, and the /bin files?   (And so forth.)  The
        system here at school has root:system as the owner for most of
        this, so that's how I have it set currently.

-       init/getty/login will be on the root floppy, because there's
        room, and because it's really nice (and almost necessary, due
        to a small bug in ash), to be able to start processes on more
        than just tty1.  I'm going to look at the feasibility of
        patching the kernel to include a very basic init that would
        start /bin/sh on tty[1234], but I doubt this will happen in
        0.95a.

-       mtools will not be on the root floppy because I haven't
        received anything from anyone, yet.  Maybe next release.

-       pfdisk will be on the root floppy, and I'm hoping someone will
        write a better fdisk.  pfdisk is adequate, but not easy-to-use
        and not equipped to make Linux extended partitions.

-       tar and compress are back on the root floppy!  By substituting
        ash for bash, I was able to fit them and pfdisk on, easily.

-       There is a 'mkdev' script, which will make the basic device
        drivers in $1/dev.  It will create $1/dev if it doesn't
        already exist.  ($1 being the first argument passed to the
        script, i.e. /mnt.)

-       There is a WARNING file to point out some of the important
        changes from 0.12/0.95 to 0.95a, such as ash replacing bash
        and the movement of some programs from /usr/bin to /bin.

-       The Linux Directory Structure Standard is on disk, with a
        sample directory tree.  This takes up minimal space, so I
        thought it would be a nice addition.  There will also be a
        'mktree' script that will make this tree built down from a
        specified place.  (Like /mnt.)

-       There will be an 'install' script that will copy the
        appropriate files from the root floppy to the specified place,
        and this will also probably try and preserve existing
        configurations, warning about changes that may need to be made.
        (Such as warning you to check /etc/rc for proper /dev/hd*
        names, and files that have been moved from /usr/bin to /bin.)
        I don't know how robust this will be, yet.

-       I'm working on creating a revised installation instructions,
        based on INSTALL-0.11 and RELNOTES-0.95.  This will probably
        not be that pretty, since others are apparently working on 
        doing this same sort of thing.  (I'd appreciate it if those
        that are would send me candidates for later root diskettes.)

Well, I've rambled on long enough (again), so I'll let y'all chew on
that.  If you see any problems with anything I've said, holler fast,
because the release of 0.95a is imminent, and the next root disk
release will likely not be until shared libraries are considered
out of alpha testing.

(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX v0.95a
=================================================
Edited and compiled by Chuck Boyer.
Internet mail address: 'boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu'
=================================================
The following is the copyright notice from the creator of Linux,
Linux Torvalds....
 
          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95
          Linus Torvalds, March 7, 1992
 
 
          COPYRIGHT
 
 
Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.  
The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU copyleft: 
get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it carries linux, 
it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and they all contain the 
copyright). 
 
 
The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you may
freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts of it, as
long as you make source available (not necessarily in the same
distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for nothing
more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you distribute will
also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.
 
 
NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface to
linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you may use
them as you wish, and using those in your binary files won't mean that
your files are automatically under the GNU copyleft.  This concerns
/only/ the unistd-library and those (few) other library functions I have
written: most of the rest of the library has it's own copyrights (or is
public domain).  See the library sources for details of those. 
 
=====================================
(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX
=====================================
 
          INSTALLATION
 
 
Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;
 
 
INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
 
 
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied version
0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard disk, among
other things. 
 
LINUX.FAQ is the linux 'Frequently-Asked-Questions'
documentation file. Grab a copy of these for future reference. Most of
the material will be beyond your understanding for a little while, but
once you have installed your Linux copy for yourself you should have
gained an understanding through the process to understand much of what
is included in these documentation files.
 
 
It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a document,
file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You use 'ftp' to call
up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the mode of transfer, and
'get filename' to transfer the file from the logged onto system ftp
site to your home directory of the machine you have called out from.
 
 
It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS and
can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create batch files
using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line statement, and
how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, erase, etc...). I am
only trying to create a documentation here for DOS users who are totally
unknowlegable of Unix system calls, utilities, commands and lastly;
being a System Administrator (which you will be once you have Linux up
and running on your 386/486 machine).
 
 
In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc. that
are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system user, so much
of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in time and effort
by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 'alt.os.linux' newsfeed.
(I have listed their names at the end of this documentation.)
 
 
Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically, you can
run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drive only, or from
your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around with Linux and
get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating System (as opposed to
a DOS operating system) then you might want to choose to just run it
from the floppy drive. Basically, the logic here would be that, you
don't want to screw up anything on your hard drive (which is loaded
with Windows, word processors, graphics programs, data-base programs,
etc.), and you have either spent long and hard learning hours to have
it set up that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and you
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive, basically.
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access to
that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' for
instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then you
wouldn't know how to do that yet...). 
 
Or, you could run Linux from booting from the floppy drive and thereafter 
having it run from the hard disk drive. 
 
The differences between these two methods are that Linux will run a lot 
(10 times?) slower if you choose to run it solely from the floppy disk 
drive, and you will be limited to the commands and utilities that you can 
run using the floppy drive only situation.
 
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more programs
and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having to learn to
1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, and 2) learning
how to maintain this partition with a handfull of sub-directories.
 
---
---
this is the beginning of the '(DOS) Beginner's Guide to Linux' documentation
that I plan on composing over the next two-three weeks to take care of
all of those users (like me) who are new to the Unix world.
Any comments, suggestions, topics/text to be submitted for inclusion
are happily received by 'boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu'.
thanks.

This is certainly the most general solution. In fact, with VFS going
properly I'd say it'd definately be the method of choice. Why limit
ourselves to executables?

I'm unsure why this is not in the spirit of Unix. Especially, if we
have VFS why waste the opportunity for a simple, general solution?

I'm also not sure I see why the files have to be either read-only or
sequential-access only. It sure makes things easier to begin with, but
on-the-fly compressions systems for Microsloth and other PC OS's
manage to get around this. The choice of block size and so on is up to
you.

I (and I suspect others) ported TeX some time ago, just for fun. OK, I
cheated; rather than porting the whole system, web2c etc al., I just took
the C source generated by web2c on a sparc (with bigTeX changes) and compiled
it under 0.12. It built without any hitches, and passed the trip test.

Here's the more tricky bit. One solution; port dvips, should be easy, then
port ghostscript with Epson LQ driver, should be easy, then in theory you can
drive an LQ printer. Alternatively, you could try the Beebe drivers; I'm not
sure what printers they support.

Of course, the tricky bit is screen previewing; presumably one could extend
the mmap()/EGA demo, but things probably aren't really stable enough as yet.
Or you could just wait for X11. An interesting solution would be to write a
very simple driver for ghostscript, the use the dvips/gs combo as above. Slow,
but it should work.

I would *really* like a working TeX system under Linux; it's the only real
reason I have for booting MSD*S nowadays. Mind you, it'll take a lot to beat
the emTeX previewer...
