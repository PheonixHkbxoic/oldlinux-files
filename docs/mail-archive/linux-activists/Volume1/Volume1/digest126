The number reported back by DOS is probably number of bytes available
AFTER the boot record, the FAT, the root directory, and any other 
stuff DOS requires but aren't part of the free space on your disk.

Can one infer from this that the Micro-channel architecture of PS/2
systems is/will be supported?  I read elsewhere that one had to have
an AT-Bus - But I know of no PS/2 386 systems with such a bus.  What's the
story?

Date: 19 Mar 92 16:40:23 GMT

WARNING! Linux 0.95a correctly identifies extended partitions, and seems
to set them up /partly/ right: but it also seems as if the actual new
partitions aren't correct.  I don't know the exact layout of the
partition information in the extended partitions, and I just assumed it
was identical to the normal partitions.  It seems I was wrong. 

If your fdisk reports partitions within the extended partition, DO NOT
USE THEM! They seem to get the correct size, but not the correct
starting sector.  Thus read/write to one of the extended partitions
(/dev/hdaX and /dev/hdbX , X >= 5) will access the incorrect sector, and
possibly corrupt data on one of the other partitions.

If someone could send me the data on the partition information within an
extended partition, I'd be grateful.

The latest version of bsd386 from bsdi does not need the 387 anymore : it
emulates it.
So, what do you intend to do ? :-)

That's because DOS sucks up some space for the FAT, directory tables,
etc.  The actual free space is greater than this.  (Look at the
'total disk space' that I think DOS reports.)

rawrite overwrites the disk's FAT, and other DOS structures.  So,
you're using the whole disk, not just the 'available bytes' that DOS
reports.

Subject: problems with 0.95a
Date: 19 Mar 92 20:01:28 GMT

0.95a is a great improvment over 0.95.  As far as I know, it fixes
the hd and fd problems, and some other general problems.  However
there are still some known problems:

  - DO NOT use the extended partition code.  It apparently
        miscalculates the locations of the logical partitions.
        My attempt to use it caused me to overwrite other
        partitions.

  - The serial support still has some problems with KA9Q.  In
        general it works better than 0.12, but it has one serious
        bug that 0.12 did not have:  If you do an FTP in one
        console, and in the other console start up Emacs, the
        serial line goes into a mode where KA9Q will no longer
        work, until the next reboot.  Presumably there are things
        other than Emacs that will do this, but it does it
        consistently, at least after a couple of uses.  Oddly
        enough the serial line still works fine for Kermit.
        But for KA9Q, it drops incoming bytes.  Interestingly,
        it worked fine on all the beta versions of 0.95a (I
        was a beta tester), but some change made between the
        final beta test and the release broke serial support.
        (This just goes to show the old adage:  DON'T CHANGE
        ANYTHING BETWEEN THE LAST BETA AND THE FINAL RELEASE!!)

  - gdb still gets "Strange things happen" and exits when
        stepping through some code.  At one point Linus believed
        this was a kernel problem.  I don't know whether he still
        does.

I heard there is a math emulator and an X windows for it, somewhere, so

my guess is that 386BSD can't compete with Linux, which with version
95a is so fast that I'm really enjoying using it.

386BSD is at release 0.0; Linux is at 0.95, right?  And you're
surprised that there is a difference? Amazingly enough (8-)), Linux is
actually more mature than something else out there.

>Bugs that Linux doesn't have (anymore), and features already added.

Does Linux have networking and NFS yet?  386BSD already has that, and is a
great incentive to go with it, instead.  (I'm holding off, actually; I
suspect that they can cross-pollinate each other, and end up looking
a great deal alike.  When they can run each others binaries, it'll be
time to think about dumping one of them 8-).)

Some of us out there will vastly prefer LINUX over BSD/386 
just because LINUX isn't BSD!  I want a SYS V'ish *NIX 
to run on my PC and if LINUX wasn't available I would 
be paying $99 for Coherent instead of using BSD.

I realize that LINUX is not just a SYS V clone, but 
a mixture of SYS V, BSD, and POSIX.  I havn't used it 
yet ( my new 386/40 should be here next week ), but 
from what I have read on this newsgroup it is just 
what I want.

Yup.  Several PS/2 machines do, indeed, have ISA buses.  I believe they
are the model 30 and 70 lines, but I'm not sure.

Depends.  It shouldn't be impossible, but MCA is (IMO) a much more rigidly
structured system, where you can use things like _protocols_ across a
hardware bus... no more should beed to be said than that...

Subject: Re: Linux v0.95a bootimage uploaded
Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1992 20:22:52 GMT

Yes, the 0.95 bootimage has been uploaded!  I found it on tsx-11
last night.  So, I thought I would list a few comments after booting
it on my system.

My System configuration:
        386-DX 25MHz
        1.2MB and 1.4MB floppies
        70MB and 80MB MFM hard disk drives
        4MB ram memory
        256K S-EGA (Genoa clone)  (NEC 3D monitor)
        4 serial ports (COM1-COM4, IRQs 4,3,4,3)
        Bus Mouse (IRQ 7, oops, not supported yet B^)

1)  The rootimage on tsx-11 was identified as corrupt 5 minutes
    after I started downloading it!  Sigh.  So I created both
    a 0.95a BOOT floppy  for the 0.95 ROOT disk, and a 0.95a BOOT
    floppy for my hard disk file system (also 0.95 root disk).

2)  The boot loaded the 8x8 font after not recognizing my video card.
    OK, it's an EGA, so my screen is now 80x43.  LINUX thinks my
    screen is 80x50!  And it sets up the TERM variable of my login
    shells to con80x50.  It also tells my video controller that I
    must have 50 line per screen, because 17 lines disappear below
    line 43 before the display starts to scroll!  Can I give a simple
    test to the video people to discern VGA from EGA?  It was published
    in DDJ a while back when they started the Graphics column.
    It involves calling a VGA BIOS interrupt.  EGAs (and CGAs, etc)
    return the function number, while VGAs return a 0 error code.
    Very simple.

2a) I want to add my EGA extended text modes to the setup.c code.
    I guess if I am patching code for my own use, I can just add
    it at the fall through label where everything else failed.
    In order to do more (and send my new code back to Linus for
    inclusing into the real source), does anyone know how to detect
    a GENOA EGA BIOS?  I can find GENOA copyright notices in the EGA
    BIOS.  Are these notices in the same location in EVERY GENOA
    EGA card?  Does the SVGA book mention anything about EGA cards?

2b) OK, so I may be buying an "S3" based SVGA card soon (it was going
    to be Real Soon Now, but my 70MB disk had a head crash last night,
    bad timing, huh?).  Is there any "clues" for these new cards?
    S3 text modes should still be limited to 16 colors, regardless
    of the graphics modes capabilities (with Sierra RAMDACs).
    (It was going to be the Diamond Stealth Hi-Color w/1MB, in case
    anyone was interested.)

3)  So I reset the TERM value, and EXPORT it from BASH.  GnuEMACS
    still thinks I have 50 lines on my screen.  Is it ignoring the
    TERM environment variable?  Do I have to load a local TERMCAP
    environment variable?  The shell also still beleives I have 50
    lines of text.  Is this because my video card seems to beleive
    this as well?  Do I have to re-set a register on the video card?

4)  I cannot run KA9Q or KERMIT from a non-root user.  KERMIT says
    EPERMS when trying to open the serial port.  KA9Q gets in an
    infinite loop that neither ^Z nor ^C can abort!  How can I log
    the user out?  Do I need a ps command?  How can the user access
    the serial port?  Do I need to chmod /dev/ttys0?

4a) KA9Q does the same if you try and open a non-existent serial device.
    Even as ROOT.  Can't get out of it. 

Side Comment to new ROOT disk maintainer:  Make the serial ports
    ttys0, ttys1, ttys2, and ttys3.  All other devices are 0 based.
    ttysx should be too.  I also like the idea of the hard disks
    being numbered as hdXY where X is a disk number and Y a partition
    number (or letter for SUN compatibility).  The same should hold
    true for SCSI disks: sdXY.  Both hd and sd devices should use the
    SAME naming scheme for X and Y.  either both numbers, or 1 letter
    and one number.  If up to 16 partitions are to be allowed, then
    X should be a number, and Y a letter to keep the devices as 4
    character names.  (We won't be supporting more than 10 disk drives
    per controller, will we??)

5)  Since I'm going to be buying a new disk drive or disk drive/controller
    RSN, what are LINUX's restrictions with regard to ESDI, IDE, and SCSI.
    I'm looking at 4 possibilities, with budget approval:

    a)  Find an 80MB HH MFM drive to replace my 70MB FH drive that died.
        this will allow me to replace my DOS stuff with minimal changes,
        and give me 9-10 more MB for LINUX partitions.

    b)  Buy a 150MB ESDI drive from a friend, an ESDI controller, and
        try to run this along with my current 80MB MFM disk under both
        DOS and LINUX.  This will be about the same cost as a) after the
        new controller, and allows me a new 80MB of disk space.
        If I cannot run both drives together, I will still have 150MB
        total disk space.  DO I NEED TO WRITE AN ESDI DRIVER or is
        someone already working on one?  This answer might influence
        the brand of ESDI controller to buy.

    c)  Buy a SCSI drive and controller.  SCSI is the wave of UNIX,
        though SCSI support for LINUX seems limited.  I've been
        reccomended to buy either a WD or Adaptec controller if I
        want to run more than just hard disks from it (like cartridge
        tape, or CD-ROM).  Is there more SCSI support than just the
        Seagate ST-0x controllers?  If so, then for what?

    d)  Buy an IDE drive and bus interface.  Same question.  Can I
        use LINUX with IDE drives?  Are there IDE drives I cannot
        (yet) use LINUX with?

    In all b), c) and d), I'm assuming that I can run two different
    disk drive types on two different controllers as long as either
    the MFM or IDE controllers can be configured as the "secondary"
    disk controller.  I have a fried who claims its possible with
    an ESDI controller as his primary, and an IDE as his secondary;
    under DOS.  I assume this will work under LINUX also?  Or does
    LINUX not yet support any disk controllers at the secondary address?

    So basically, what is my best choice for LINUX from the four above?
