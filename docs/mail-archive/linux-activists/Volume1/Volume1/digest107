One thing I noticed in the upgrade from 0.12 to 0.95 is that the
colors from ANSI sequences.  I noticed this when my copy of rain
went from two shades of blue to red.  My question is: are the
colors currently in the LINUX 0.95 kernel the final ones?  If
so, I will post the diffs to rain to get it back to its peaceful
blue colors.  <GRIN>

I put a binary distribution of NetHack 3 Patch Level 10 on
tsx-11.mit.edu.

    ~ftp/pub/linux/binaries/usr.games/nh3p10bin.tar.Z 

It needed fewer patches than Patch Level 6.  It plays with no visible
problems.  Thanks to Quowong P. Liu (qpliu@phoenix.princeton.edu) for
giving me a solution to the problem with screen draws on zapping and
throwing.  This posting contains a few things I forgot to put in the
readme.

The tar is called nh3p10bin.tar.Z and is 549399 bytes, and should
verify with sum (on an Ultrix-box at any rate) of 27459 537.

To untar, cd to root, and untar to create entries in /usr/games and
/usr/man/man6 (the manuals format OK with cawf).  I've included the
formatted version of the guide.  Unpacked it requires about 1.7 Megs
of disk.

You need the poe-igl login/init, and possibly other patches like
non-blocking.  I've lost track of which patches I've applied to my
0.12 system, so I can't say much more than this.

I have all the /usr/games files owned by games, with suid being set as
appropriate.  

I forgot to change the Wizard's name (ie game debug name) from
"michael", my name, to something more generic.  But I've verified that
you can use mg to edit the executable to change the occurances of
"michael^@" to something else like "root^@^@^@^@" (i.e. a null padded
string which works out to the same size as my name).  But unless you
want to be the Wizard, just don't worry about it.

The job control support doesn't work (and in this distribution I
forgot to switch it on anyway - sorry).  You can suspend it, but you
can't get back in.  Also, I don't seem to be able to kill -HUP, except
from the owning terminal session (not even when I log into another
v-console as root).  When job-control is turned on, you can get back
in, but the tty is no longer in raw/cbreak mode (which should it be?).

The -dec character set option works fine on a vt320, but on the
console, the dots come out as Pound signs, but the line drawing set
looks OK.  I compiled for S.V. colour term capabilities, but I
haven't noticed any colours (anyone know enough to test this?).

Here's what I put in /usr/games/lib/nethackdir/README.LINUX:

Nethack 3 Patch Level 10 
Unoffical patches to port pl10 to Linux 0.12 using GCC 1.4
Michael Hamilton (hamilton@csc.wcc.govt.nz)

See the patches in linux.patches. They address:
 1) A suitable configuration for linux:
    System V
    -lcurses
    no mail (not on my box yet)
    compress in /usr/bin/compress
    ...
 2) Problem with /usr/include/pwd.h and unixmain.c
 3) Problems with screen draws for zap and throw.
    Fix suggested by Quowong P. Liu (qpliu@phoenix.princeton.edu).
 4) Problem with %[,]%[\n] args to linux scanf.
    Wrote my own tiny-parser so that the score logfile
    will not need changing when scanf does work.

This is a quick hack, and I'm sure I nethack-hacker could do better.
BUT IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE JUST FINE.

The patches here should be distributed as a formal notification that
the binaries have been created from patched files that have been
changed from the official Version 3 Patch Level 10 distribution.

Definitly runs for 2 users in 4 megs + 1 meg swap, but there may be
problems with memory when you get very deep.

Ain't linux great!

KA9Q is a TCP/IP implementation.  It's a port of software written for
MS/DOS.  Under MS/DOS, it uses the packet drivers.  There is a packet
driver for TR that emulates an Ethernet.  Unfortunately it's harder to
do Ethernet or TR under Unix.  Under Unix, user programs (which KA9Q
is) don't normally use hardware like Ethernet or TR cards at the low
level that KA9Q expects.  However that's just tradition.  There's no
good reason you couldn't implement a device driver that supports a
/dev/ethernet or /dev/token, with read and write system calls to read
and write packets, and a couple of ioctl's.  That would be enough to
let KA9Q do its thing.  There'd need to be some low-level coode in
KA9Q as well, but it would be easy to write.  The hard part of the
Ethernet or TR encapsulation is ARP, and that code is already present.

This might be a reasonable intermediate step in progress towards full
network support.  The main disadvantage would be that the version of
KA9Q I ported is really a single-user program.  That's probably OK for
SLIP, but maybe not so good for Ethernet.  There's another Unix port
of KA9Q that reorganizes it into a single server talking to multiple
clients in a way that would probably work with "tubes".  That would be
more appropriate for Ethernet or TR (and it's even possible that it's
got some support for Ethernet -- though you'd still need a device
driver).  Sorry, I don't recall where that port is.  If you look for
KA9Q in archie you should turn it up.  I didn't use that version
(1) because there was nothign like tubes when I first did the
port, and (2) because that version looked more difficult to port.

the only FAQ I've seen does not give this information in a sufficiently

Hmm, a lot of people have asked exactly the same in other newsgroups.
The problem is that new versions of rz/sz use /dev/tty as the device
for sending/recieving files. This is fine if you call the Unix/Linux
machine from remote, because then on the remote machine /dev/tty IS your
terminal, but locally, /dev/com<whatever> != /dev/tty.

The solution is either to use an old version of rz/sz (pre-88, PD too)
or find in the source the "Tty = open("/dev/tty", 2)" and change this
to "Tty = 1" or something suitable.

Hope this solves your problem, Mike.

This is already planned for Linux 0.95a.  The kernel will first look
in /etc for init, and then it will look in /bin.  The root disk will
have it in /etc, per the Linux Directory Structure Standard.

This will likely occur as well.  I'm waiting for more feedback from
the Standards people before I move more things around on the root
floppy.

This is also silly in that /usr can be a mounted partition.  How do
run init from /usr/etc if it's not mounted yet?

Also, a note to people wondering where I'm coming from and saying how
things "will be" in Linux 0.95a.  I will be handling the release of
the root diskette for Linux 0.95a, expected sometime next week.
Things I have changed or plan to:

-       ash replaces bash as the standard shell.  This frees up a lot
        of room.

-       There is a nearly complete, but empty, directory tree on the
        root floppy.  This conforms to the LDS Standard.

-       All of the standard devices will be there.  That means no more
        people asking why mount /dev/hdb4 doesn't work.  The /mnt
        directory is there as well.

-       Some preliminary installation documentation and scripts.  This
        is the area I need the most feedback on.  What would you like
        to see here?

-       compress and tar are back on the root floppy, with tar
        compressed as on the 0.12 floppy.  cat has also been added.

If you have suggestions for changes to be made from the 0.95 -> 0.95a
root floppy, fire away.  Time is limitied, though.

(Also, although it won't happen in 0.95a, it is my hope that 0.96 or a
later release of the 0.95a root floppy (0.95b?) will used shared
libs.  This will create even more room on the root floppy.)

Well, I should have said "it lacks job control that can compile

Are there any fixes to these bugs?  If so, I'd like to go ahead and

I know how it goes.  I was just pointing out that the development of
Linux is going so rapidly, that something that is missing now will
likely be filled in quickly.  A case in point is rdev - rootdev
appeared on the 0.95 root floppy, and within a few days someone built
a better mousetrap that modified boot images as well.  Not bad, I
think.

> I have, however, gotten mail about one other point - my comment about
>needing a small, generic mtools on the root image.

I don't see mtools as being necessary, at all.  If you want to
transfer files from DOS to Linux, get rawrite.exe and rawrite tar
files to diskettes, and then read those with tar under Linux.  The
only possible advantage of mtools is that it can access DOS hard drive
partitions, but I personally wouldn't trust it to do so.

As a result, you won't see mtools on the 0.95a root floppy.  It would,
however, be great if someone took the time to make a mtools.tar.Z that
came with a good README.linux and a sample devices.c, so those that
felt a need for mtools could compile it easily.  The currently
available ones are a bit tricky to set up, and require a bit of
guesswork in devices.c.

>Am I completely off-base with this?  Am I forgetting/overlooking 
>something?

I wouldn't say you're off base, but I think you're tackling the issue
from the wrong side.  I don't think Linux should be forced to read DOS
devices - I think DOS should write things that Linux can read.

Tar is already on the root floppy because it is a 'standard' Unix
tool.  We should make use of that rather than try and jam more onto
the already-crowded root floppy.

Then again, if someone writes a DOS file system for Linux, this
discussion would be pointless.  I'd rather see a faster file system
for Linux, first, though, to replace the brain-dead Minix one.  I need
room for more descriptive filenames like bc-1.02.bin.tar.Z and
bc-1.02.src.tar.Z.

news here at stolaf due to serious net.hicoughs, and may have missed

Along those lines, I have noticed something rather interesting:
I have hostname set to roland, and PS1 set to `hostname`%
After I run kermit, for a while, I get _either_
%
or
roland%
as my prompt, sometimes alternating, and the longer the kermit session
was, the longer this condition occurs.  I have not yet found a
