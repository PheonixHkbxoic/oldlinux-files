I think it's a good idea to offer commercial support - though it would
be appropriate to forward some part of the price the client pays to
the author(s?) of the software.  I understand that the FSF recommends
something like this.

One social commentary - when you do this, don't brag and boast about
the tens of thousands of $$$$ you are getting and complain about how
bothersome it would be to implement any of the proposals to forward
some of the money to the community every week on alt.os.linux like
Eric S. Raymond is doing on alt.folklore.computers ;-) ;-)

I agree.

Oops, well I guess I haven't done anything for Linux so I guess I have
no business in meddling in the affairs.

Given the differences of opinion, I suppose someone would need to keep
track of the copyrights etc. - FSF policy seems to be the require
written paper disclaimers / assigments for the stuff they distribute
to keep clear of legal trouble.

   hello,       while I was copying linux a while ago, i tried to use some unformatted
   disks with raw write.  and raw write couldn't recognize them or something until
   I DOS formatted them.  I'm wondering why do we need to DOS format in the
   first place anyways since raw write just writes to the appropriate tracks
   on the disk

In fact, DOS format does two or three separate things when used on a
diskette:

1.      It creates the actual tracks on it (if they don't already exist)
2.      It creates a DOS directory structure on the disk
3.      It may also transfer the operating system files on the disk, if
        asked

So, basically, you don't need the format command because of the DOS
directory structure, but to create the tracks for rawrite to write on.

In some operating systems the above things are separated to different
commands. For example, in SCO Unix (if I remember right), the format
command does only phase 1, and a separate command (mkfs) is used to
build the file system on the disk (phase 2)if required. This makes the
logical distinction much clearer, and I believe a linux-based format
will work that way, when (not 'if') created.

BIBTEX

bibtex now works and is available for ftp in pub/linux/bibtex.tar.Z on
archsci.arch.su.oz.au (129.78.66.1). This file contains the binary file only
as the support files were included in texlib.tar.Z also available in the same
directory.

For those who need to do citations of the form (Knuth 1972) in their documents
the files in pub/harvard on the same site provide this capability together with
documentation in harvard.tex.

METAFONT

Binaries ONLY for metafont are available in pub/mfbin.tar.Z. You will need
to get font source files, etc from one of the standard tex sites.

dvips has a facility for generating fonts that it cannot find by calling a
script file called MakeTeXPK (provided either in texlib.tar.Z or dvips.tar.Z)
which will need modification w.r.t. where to put the generated pk files.
The dvips documentation describes this in more detail.

Not necessarily so :)  I hear that the 16550 can run at 115KB - also, if you're
running a fast 386 or 486, it might be able to handle it (with careful tuning
of the driver, that is).  That's why I said "in theory". It certainly won't
work in all cases.

Oh bloody hell.  This news leads me to believe that there is some problem with
DTK motherboards and Linux.  I just hopped into here to post my own gripe about
a bug..  
 
Linux 0.95 runs just fine on my 386sx/16 with 4mb of RAM. it runs FAST! kudos.
  infact, it runs so fast that I decided to move it over to my BIG machine...
  alas.. no joy.
Linux 0.95 on my DTK 386/25 (no cache) with 4mb of RAM and two Seagate ST1144A

IDE harddisks does very odd things..  here's a description:

It runs alright, but at random intervals it 'sticks' and keeps repeating
"HD timeout" and the hard disk makes evil angry noises. IT continues to do this
for about 8 to 10 retries and then reports "HD I/O error: bad block xxxx"
(or an error messgage similar to that. my system is just sitting there being
perfectly calm at the moment, so I can't quote the message)  and then repeats
the entire cycle of "timeout-timeout-timeout-I/O error" over and over and over
until I give it a three finger salute.   I've picked up the habit of appending
a ";sync" to all my commands so that i don't lose much when I reboot it.
 
Is there a fix?  I am running 0.95.. would 0.95a help me any?  Are there any
other DTK users who are not having this or other problems?

If the track-mapping is in the controller and not in some bios-routines,
linux should be able to run with it: indeed it happens automatically for
most machines I've heard of. Are you 100% sure linux can't use it
already?

/If/ linux seems unable to use the mapping-feature, there is still some
hope.  I've left in the old code that hardcoded the harddisk parameters
instead of reading them from the BIOS, and by editing the config.h file
you can hardcode linux to think you have a specific number of sectors/
heads/tracks.  Check out linux/config.h: the HD_TYPE macro. This isn't
guaranteed to help your problems, but it's worth a try.
