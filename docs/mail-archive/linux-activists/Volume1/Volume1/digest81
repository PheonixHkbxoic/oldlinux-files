I can't get a shell to run in a window under emacs.  I noticed in the
diffs something that appeared to deactivate this ability for linux.  Did
I see this correctly?  Is there no way to run a shell in the linux
version?  Do I need to install the kernel patches that came with emacs?

There are two places you should look in order to answer this question.
First try downloading the emacs FAQ which I believe addresses this
question. Also, you might try taking a look at how it is done in
Demacs, the Messy-dos port of emacs. Both are available at
ftp.math.ksu.edu in /pub/pc/demacs/*.zip and
/pub/pc/demacs/misc/emacsfaq.zip.

I'm the one who ported pcomm.  I'm using it with a kernel that has the non-
blocking i/o patches that accompanied another package (I think it was mg).
It may be possible that those patches make pcomm work for me.

Although I completely agree with everything that was mentioned 
regarding init, etc...  I would like to point out that most of the
vixie-cron zombies should be going away in version 0.13; when
some signal handling (SIG_CHLD particularly) is (hopefully) cleaned
up.... 

Also; would we like another device for annoying kernel messages; or
some special handling of certain control characters for the console.
I know on some boxes, CNTRL-<something>  indicates that kernel messages
are no longer printed on the console; CNTRL-<something-else> re-enables
them.  I found that feature very helpful in the pre-X days.

This is not strictly true.  Most motherboards map the missing 384k above
1M.  ie, if you have a board with 2 meg, you get memory in the 0-640k 
region, and memory in the 1M - 2.384M region.

A 386 or even a 486 coupled with the ISA architecture is NOT the best thing
to start playng with access to multiple resources.
I mean:
Have you tried with your Sun386i to run kermit at 19200 + compile + run one
of the DOS programs ? How is the kermit going ? How is the speed of the
machine ?
NOTE that the Sun386 is probably NOT an ordinary PCAT compatible.... it is
probably BETTER for UNIX !

I believe that if Linux is:
FAST
STABLE
STANDARD ( with reference with posix and SysVr4 )
Support X11
You will have much better programs than under DOS.

Of course if it is 
SLOW
UNSTABLE
it is less probale that this happens

Well...
The point is that DOS assumes that the machine is ALL for him !
Believe me, it is NOT simple. It is NOT simple to create a complete
virtual machine that is USABLE.

The point is:
You believe that it simple.....
Yust TRY to do it !
I like better to try to port X11 or TCP-IP

The DOS you are talking is just one part of the DOS that there is around
This part is fading away as more and more windows applications come out.

If you want DOS + other stuff around just buy OS/2.

Before flaming... just remembar that I am not sayng that it is not
possible. I am not sayng that it should not be done. What I am sayng is
that FIRST we implement:

A STABLE linux
With TCP-IP
IPC
X11
Posix and AT&TSysVr4 compliant

I have a slightly different problem.  It appears that the parity isn't being
set because I get garbage when connected to a 7-E-1 unix host.  Suggestions

The touch typist can basically use VI without leaving home row.  Just

In insert mode, CNTRL-H is backspace.  Ant cntr-[ is escape to get you out to

I have an Irwin Accutrak 250 tape drive in my system and decided to see how
difficult it would be to write a driver to support it under Linux.  I called
Irwin (apparently now owned by Maynard) and was told that they cannot give out
technical information on their drives!

So, does anyone know of a drive manufacturer with a more sane policy?  I had
been a fan of Irwin drives but now find myself having to recommend that people
look elsewhere.  Irwin *must* release specs under some circumstances as some
third party backup software supports Irwin drives!

Although Irwins are not true QIC-80 drives, does anyone know where I could get
information on how QIC-80 drives interface with the floppy controller?

On another front, it's great to see the SCSI drivers out.  Great work, Drew!
I have an UltraStor 14F on order and plan to start a low-level driver for it
as soon as the specs arrive.

I have uploaded the version of ps I have written for Linux to
funic.funet.fi and tsx-11.mit.edu (file ps012.tar.Z).

You have to apply some patches to the kernel before you can use
ps, the patches are for /dev/kmem and /dev/mem and a few other
fixes necessary for ps. Maybe it's a bad time to upload these
patches, with a new version of Linux beeing released in a few days,
but some people might want to experiment on the old kernel first.
I'll upload patches for version 0.13 when it's out.

Subject: Q's.: HD Boot, Oak SVGA, cm in termcap?
Date: 3 Mar 92 15:48:21 GMT

3 questions for anyone who can help...

1. Several people (myself included) want to boot entirely from HD but not using
shoelace (last time I looked at it I wasn't impressed). So, I have Linux fully
installed in it's own partition, swap partition set up etc but can only boot
using floppy as my first stage. How do I get the boot image (as generated by
make in /linux) onto the first track/sector of my Linux partition. Is this what
I need to do? As far as I can remember from last time I played with my
partition table I have to get part of it (first 512 bytes) into track 1/sector
0 (or is it 0/0?) and I have to edit my partition table to make the partition
bootable. What then? Where does the rest of the stuff in the image go? What
should it be called? Any clues anyone?

2. Oak SVGA.... anyone using one? I have one which Linux recognises as a SVGA
but doesn't give me a choice of modes so I'm stuck with 80x25 instead of 132x60
or whatever. Any hints?

3. I got fed up with kermit 'cos it kept losing the first coloumn of output
from nn when I logged on to my local unix host. I assumed this was a kermit bug
but now I'm not so sure. I wrote my own basic comms program and logged on. NN
produced the same results (writing directly to stdout.... p.s. have I killed my
/dev/tty or does it not work.... root owns it and doesn't like me opening it)
so I tried again with a logfile active. It is packed with ansi sequences
(mostly cursor motion (cm in termcap) and has ALL the information... column 1
and all) present so, why is the display mucking up? My terminal is the con80x25
entry which I assume is doing a vt100 implementation (as is the remote end) so,
any known "undocumented features"?

Any help gratefully acknowledged,

I'm not sure this will make the newsgroup but here goes.
I had the same problem with Pcomm not echoing chars. I was
bringing it up while logged in as root. I tried with a different
user name and it worked! (altho I still had (have) problems with
the dialing directory). I can't quite make the connection why it        
doesn't work with root, but, that's the way it works.

Subject: Help with ESIA / ISA
Date: 3 Mar 92 18:52:10 GMT


        I'm about to buy a 486 and I am in cycles about buying a ESIA or a
ISA bus with it.  

        First, will linux be able to utilize the faster bandwith of the 
ESIA bus if I have a scsi controller?  Or will it not make much of a 
difference?  Will swapping be more bareable with ESIA?

        When X finally gets devolped will it make sense to have the ESIA then
so the bandwith of an advanced SVGA card can be utilized?

        So... can someone help me?  Which should I buy?  Money counts but
isn't the most important factor.  I need performance a little better then
that of a DECstation 3100.  (IE I don't need opaque moves but if it is 
possible it would be nice :), but I'd like to have very quick response).

I'm trying to compile tr.c from the bsd sources and I get the followinf
errors

extern.h:50 parse error before `__P'
extern.h:51 parse error before `__P'

the offending lines are

void    err __P((const char *fmt, ...));
int     next __P((STR *));

It looks like a macro but I don't know where from.

I also get an error in tr.c about optind not being declared, which it
isn't. Has anyone ported this and had this problem?

Also, I compiled patch but I first had to remove a line

int sprintf();  

as far as I remember. Anyway, this line conflicts with the definition in
stdio.h, both the old one and the gcc 1.40 version. The conflict is not
whether it should be char or int but the emtpy ellipses. Does anyone
know anything about this?

While I'm raising queries, does bash support job control. When I run
bash the job command isn't recognised. It works fine under /bin/sh. 
What is /bin/sh? I had assumed it was bash but they're obviously
different.

I don't have those patches installed, but pcomm works (basically).
The first time I tried, though, because (not having read the document)
I didn't realize I had to make a dialing entry with no phone number

Perhaps others were as hasty as I?

I have similar problems, but, it does work , what i do is this:

i dial, then i do a pass-through ^A-T for 5 secs. when it returns
from that, things work perfectly -- they aslo work during the pass through.
I am running an unmodified 0.12 kernel.

Linus,
I have an IBM(compatible) 386sx with 8meg of memory and two hard drives that add up to 100mb storage capacity. I had no problem booting up linux 0.12 but in the install docs it said that I had to change a word at offsets 508, and 509 in the bootimage. Firstly I haven't been able to get the bootimage over onto the hardrive, and I haven't got a clue as to how to alter an offset, (whatever that is),
in a binary file, or is the bootimage source readily available. I really want to learn a lot more about unix, and that's why I want to install a unix like os. I'm an ex-VMS enthusiast, but when I was forced to learn Unix(by my boss), I learned how powerful an operating system UNIX really is. Anyway I'm kinda new to this stuff, so if you help with some clues, it would be greatly appreciated.
