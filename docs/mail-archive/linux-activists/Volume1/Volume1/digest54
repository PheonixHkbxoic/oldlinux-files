There is not, almost by definition, any "compatibility" issues with
/dev/kmem unless the kernel structures are identical.  What use is it
to open /dev/kmem and suck up the proc structure when its not at all
what the user program expects?

I agree 100% with Chuck; having written programs that have to grovel
around in kernel memory, I'd prefer to have a well defined interface
to return the information that I need.  I certainly don't WANT to use
/dev/kmem in my programs; I just have no other choice.  That means on
less thing to worry about when you decide to reimplement your kernel
data structure to the new and improved whizzy version.

I finally got Linux to mount my hardrives, but I have another problem. How do I

Many people have reported that Linux crashes during disk-intensive
operations, and have specualted that it's either a file system probem
(unlikely) or a mem. management problem (more likely, they say).  Is
it possible that it's a hard-drive problem?  

I know that on my machine (a 386 at 25MHz, IDE drive), DJGPP (GCC for
DOS) occaisonally reports a ``Not Ready Error Reading Drive C:'' which
or course is preposterous.  It's a fixed disk and is always ready.
GNU Emacs (DEMACS) also crashes sometimes during disk access,
presumably because it's getting the not ready error and doesn't know
what to do about it.  Does the kernal check for this?

I don't really know what can be done about the problem.  I know that
(with DJGPP) by the time the error message pops up, it's too late.
The machine has crashed.  But perhaps this need not be so.

Alas, like so many other problems, I have yet to find an exact way of
replicating the problem.  Editing a 4MB binary file with DEMACS
usually does it, though....

Subject: Symbolic links to DOS filesystem??
Date: 16 Feb 92 22:05:51 GMT

I have yet another suggestion, with no idea as to its implementability
(to coin a word):

How difficult would it be to allow special symbolic links to files in
a DOS partition, a la mtools?  For example, I currently run emTeX
under DOS, and plan to run TeX until Linux as well.  But I would HATE
to have to maintain duplicate font files.

Also, I use an appointment-minder program.  It would be great if I
could keep just one file, readable by both DOS and Linux.  (I don't
even want to try giving DOS access to Linux....)

Please don't write back telling me to give up DOS.  I develop software
for MS-DOS.  Also, emTeX is much better than Unix TeX, IMHO.

How hard would it be to let symbolic links refer to piped commands, e.g
ln -s "|mtype c:/tex/fonts/foo.pk" foo.pk

The "|" character is supposed to tell the filesystem what to do with this
kind of link when it gets opened, disallow certain file modes, etc.
This would give a fairly crude DOS access as a trivial side effect of a
more general mechanism.  Of course, I am not offering to implement it...
not until I have a Linux system... ;-)

Yes, there seems to be a bug in the old 8250 serial chips during 
which the transmit buffer empty interrupt will get lost if the 
receive buffer fills and the transmit buffer empties within a 
small window of time.  (The buffers referred to here are actually
one "word" - 8 bits in this case - shift registers rather than
the multi-byte FIFO's one might be tempted to infer from the use
of the word "buffer").  Back in '84 I wrote a DOS device driver 
which suffered from this bug.  Because my DOS programs had lots of 
spare time, I worked around it with a backup polling routine in 
the driver called from the application (I called it "kick8250" 
because that's what I wanted to do with it).

A number of local self-proclaimed "experts" said that there 
wasn't a problem with the hardware and that my driver must be at 
fault ('course challenge them to find my bug and what happens...?).
Several years later, I gained access to the net and asked about the 
problem there.  One kind person told me about the timing bug and 
explained that although the IIR (Interrupt Identification Register)
does not get set correctly, which is what we mean when we say that 
the transmitter interrupt gets "lost," the status registers do.
Thus, you can kludge it up by checking for the transmit buffer
empty condition during your interrupt service routine whenever you 
are expecting a transmitter interrupt and you'll catch it, even 
when the chip doesn't.  Ironically, all I needed to do was call my
kick8250 routine from the ISR instead of the application and I
would have been fine.

BTW: I am intensly interested in your "compressed SLIP" and your
version of ka9q.  'Course I'm going to need a bigger hard disk to 
accomodate Linux and all these other goodies, but that's my problem.

Exact numbers, PLEASE.  And all five of them.  The ax bx cx dx are 
registers, as they were going INTO the the disk BIOS call.  The top
number without a register name is the return code from the interrupt 
call, and records the number of sectors successfully read as 
well as what the error was.

Quick guess : 

Make sure the disk was formatted to high density.  /t:80 /n:18 for 
a 3.5" disk.  The most common problem people have is writing to 
a disk that was formatted low density.  While it fits, the BIOS 
will only report the maximum number of sectors supperted, not
what is on the disk in the drive, and the bootstrap code
 gets sector not found errors when reading the disk.

"Or something like that"

That is an error dump, of the registers going into the int 13h call
in the bootstrap program, and the return code comming out - which
tells us such things as "Where did the read fail?, how many
sectors were actually read?".  There are five four digit
hex numbers.  All of them might help solve your problem.


Most common problem :

Writing the bootimage to a low density disk.  While it fits, 
the bootstrap code will only recognize high density disks.
It's a quirk of the BIOS, which will only report the maximum 
number of sectors supported, not the number actually on the 
disk in the drive.

Try formatting a disk explicitly as high density - ie 
        

format A: /n:18 /t:80 for a 3.5"
format A: /n:15 /t:80 for a 5.25"

A 486-33 outperforms a low end SPARC, and my 386-33 is easily twice 
as fast as my HP Bobcats.

64 tasks is not enough.  While 64 "real" programs running might 
be extremely slow, you also have second copies of a program forked 
out so it doesn't get stuck (worst case - 32 real tasks), zombies 
that cannot be killed and are filling up the process table, 
system daemons that are sleeping most of the time (crond, update, 
etc), four or five shells waiting for input, all counting against the maximum.

64 MB : when you start memory mapping files, or worse, entire file systems, 
this becomes a real limit.

Yes.  You can have device drivers be dynamically linked, as with 
shared libraries.  However, the current kernel does not provide 
enough support, in terms of timeout timers, etc to add device drivers
without hacking the rest of the kernel.

Conditional compilation would be feasible with only minor 
changes, and accomplish the same thing, making some features 
optional.  Last time I built the kernel from scratch, 
it took around 8 minutes on a 386-33.

Without shoelace, Linux won't boot off the hard disk, only mount the

        Another data point.  I have a 386/20 8 meg with a 330 meg ESDI
hard drive.  I think there is a hardware problem related to the hard
drive, ESIX would periodically hang with the disk-access light on, and
sometimes complain about nmi's.  These things would always happend
when the hard drive was under intensive use.  Linux has crashed with
the hard drive light on a few times, and with it off many times.  One
time the crash happened when I had about 800 pages of free memory.  I
have never had a problem under dos.  Perhaps other people are
experiencing similiar hardware problems.  I know the sytems are the
similiar.

Well, shared libs aren't using shared memory (oh, they share pages if
they can, but basically the shared libs are just a "secondary
executable" loaded at the 60M mark in the process space).  To my
knowledge nobody else is working on shared memory. 

Shared memory should probably be relatively easy (from the page-sharing
point of view: you'd have to keep track of it all, of course): I did
think about it when I wrote the mm.  The problem with this (and so many
other things) is that I've never used the shared memory syscalls, so I
don't feel I'm the right person to implement them: I wouldn't see a bug
if it hit me on the head with a sledgehammer, as I wouldn't know the
expected behaviour.
