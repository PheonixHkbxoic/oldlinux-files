Spaces are, in fact, quite legal in filenames, although dashes are more
usually used.  (But perhaps you knew this, and put the smiley there for
that reason?)

This would mean that each file would, in fact, consist of two files.  An
what's worse, you would need two different methods to access them.  And
then you'd want one note file for change history, one for To-Do-lists,
one for this, and one for that, so as not to confuse things by putting
everything into the same file.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with an application providing this, but
it should not, IMHO, be in the operating system.

Hi!  I'm a longtime Unix user but new to Linux.  I am running Linux 1.2,
the latest images from tsx-11.mit.edu.

I installed it this weekend and ran into a few problems.

1. I initially partitioned my disk into 3.  Linux fdisk showed the
   partitions numbered as follows:

   60 MB DOS            hd2
   10 MB LINUX          hd3
   10 MB LINUX          hd4

   I then thought about it some more, and decided I wanted small root and
   swap partions, and a big user partition.  I used MSDOS edpart to split
   the third partition into about 7 and 3 MB.  However, after doing this I
   found I could no longer boot off of hd3.  It took a while, but I finally
   discovered that now the partitions were labeled:

   60 MB DOS            hd1
   10 MB LINUX          hd2
   7 MB LINUX           hd3
   3 MB LINUX           hd4

   It seems strange to me that changing one partition should change the
   naming of other partitions.  This makes it difficult to know how to boot
   the root partition after changing other partitions...

2. I had a number of system hangs relating to pipes.  For instance, Linux
   hung when I tried to copy one partition to another via:

   cd /
   mount /dev/hd4 /mnt
   tar cvf - bin etc usr | (cd /mnt; tar xf -)

   I *was* able to successfully copy the partition in two steps, however:

   tar cvf /mnt/foo.tar bin etc usr
   cd /mnt
   tar xvf foo.tar

3. Although I was able to read the floppy device with arbitrary block
   sizes, writing with a block size other than 512 went into a hard loop in
   the floppy driver, and it would spew "Resetting floppy" to the console.
   This is trivial to reproduce via dd (try bs=1k, for instance).

4. Sometimes I would make a new partition, run "mkfs -c" on it, and it
   would seem fine (fsck wouldn't complain, for instance).  However, when I
   would try to write to it it would be OK for a while but then hang the
   kernel.  Sorry, I can't be more specific here - I don't know what the
   parameters of the problem were.  Suffice it to say that I'm not back to
   my original 60/10/10 partition configuration, have run "mkfs -c" with
   the correct blocksize on the third partition (hd4), but can't copy the
   files to it via the "tar" step used above anymore.  It does about 10
   files and then hangs.

I'd appreciate any pointers here.

Thanks,
        Bob

P.S. I'm using tar instead of "cp +recursive" because I want to preserve
links wherever possible to reduce diskspace consumption.
P.P.S. It will be more effective to contact me via email than this
newsgroup, due to its volume and my time constraints :-)

Yes, but performance is horrid, due to the lack of blocking on I/O.  As a 
result, while it was quite comfortable on the HP 9000/550 multi-processor sysV
system I was working on it on in 1989, it's a real pain today.  I'd go with
option 3, I think.

Yes.  But excellant job getting the pre-NOS working quickly, if nothing else,
it'll be useful for ftp'ing the NOS sources over, 'eh?  :-)

Hello All,
   I've gotten back to working on porting pax (a tar/cpio replacement) and
have run into a few problems:
  1) open() dies after opening (and then closing) so many files. pax opens
the output archive for writeing, then opens a file for reading, places it
into the achive, closes it and then opens another for reading. This works
fine for the first 200 to 250 files and then all of the sudden starts to
return -EINVAL. After that pax gives up and quits.
  2) fflush(NULL) dies with a segment violation, it should flush all open
files, according to POSIX at least.

  If anyone has fixes for either of these problems please let me know.

  Other than that pax seems to work, I've put 200 or so files into one 4-disk
backup and restored them fine.  I've also been using pax to move archives
to and from a Sun, via multiple floppy-disk archives without a problem.
  I would like to get it to work completly befor I post it, but since the
problems don't seem to be with pax, I'll put it on an ftp site the way it
is, if people ask.

thanks,
Paul

You probably have another shell in another vc that whose working
directory is the one you try to remove (or something below it).

I don't know about kermit, but that grep bug looks like its due to the
toupper tolower problem in Linux 0.11. It probably would be a good
idea to recompile all the binaries in the distribution, I know I had
to fix unzip because of this same bug.
