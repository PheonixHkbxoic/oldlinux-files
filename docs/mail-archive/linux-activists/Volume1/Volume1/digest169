Um, nobody's saying you can't name your serial port device after your
dog, or anything else that you might like, but the point is to have a
base set of names that people programming under Linux can rely on
being there.

Right, but standards are there so people can actually use the system,
help others use the system, and program for the system.  It would be
foolish to tell everyone:  "Well, make up your own name for the serial
devices."

Please take a look on cs.rutgers.edu, /pub/linux/READ.tim-futil.
(This is the same system as athos.rutgers.edu, but we're in the
process of decomissioning athos.  cs should always work.)  This
will point you to other files in that area containing date
related stuff.  Time is a mess.  The Gcc 1.40 libraries, which
are what I currently recommend using, do not have real date/time
code.  There are lots of non-working stubs.  I've fixed it,
but nobody is maintaining the 1.40 libraries anymore, so there's
noplace for my fixes to go.  You might simply take my version
of the libraries (which are there). In order to have real date/time
support, you need:

  fixed libc
  /usr/share/zoneinfo, or zic (the time zone compiler) and the
        files to rebuild zoneinfo
  date and other programs that display date and time
  if you want to be able to reset the CMOS clock, a kernel patch

All of these things are on cs.rutgers.edu.  Linus apparently hasn't
taken the kernel patch, and there's nobody home with libc, until the
GCC 2 libc is released, so I'm not quite sure what to do with it.  If
you don't care about running in the right time zone, you can just take
the "date" binary.  If you want to run in the right time zone, you'll
need the whole package, at least in binary form.  I supply new
binaries of the Gnu file utilities linked with the new library, so
that "ls -l" will show the right time.

Did you get my patches? With that patches, you can use target as

        i386-linux

You also need the libc.a fro gcc 2.1. Drop me a note if you are
interested.

You first should build gcc 2.1 running on sparc for sparc. Then build
ld, as, ar and ranlib running on sparc for Linux. After that, use gcc
you just build to build gcc running on sparc for Linux.

Thus you get yourself gcc, ld, as, ar and ranlib running on sparc for
Linux. To cross-compile for Linux, you have to use start files and
libraries compiled for Linux as well as Linux's header files.

Hope that helps.

It is my understanding that gld doesn't work correctly accros
opposite-endian machines -- so a VAX and a 386 should be fine, and a
SPARC and a 68K should be fine, but if you cross endians, it'll barf.
I think this might even be in the documentation, but I am not

I'm having some problems after uppgrading to 0.95a.

1. I can't make the gcc1.40 (wich worked wonders under
   the 0.12), work now.

   This is what happens when I try to compile:

   general protection
   EIP:   000f:00000180
   EEFLAGS:   00010246

   18 89 55 fc 8b 45 fc 80 38 2d
   Program fatal signal 18

   Any ideas ???

2. I can't make the gcc2.0 work proparly. Complains
   about error in include file.

   When compiling I get:

   parse error at or near '(' in line 97 in
   the stdio.h file.

   What is wrong ? (me ?)

3. I final question: I'm no UNIX guru, but I want to take
   advantage of all the patches out there.
   Can anyone mail me a description of how patching is done ?

I would be very gratefull for any help / suggestions !

 by "burning bridges" as i went, i was able to compile a bootimage with a

it does the
loading.................
  then pauses a while (3 sec maybe)
  then, as normal, displays MDA at top right of screen and the

    but immediately thereafter it reboots. sigh. any ideas why?

Re: Problems with mtools
Yeah, I know about this one ... fwrite() is broken in gcc 2.0 (2.1 who knows?)
Well anyway the fix is really simple. Just change the two calls to fwrite() to
calls to write(). You do lose the buffering :-( but at least it works.

Hallo Linuxers,

I think something's wrong with the symbolic links:
When I link /usr/src to /z/src (/z/src is a directory) and doing a
find (eg find / -name hd.c) I get

/z/src/linux/.../hd.c
/usr/src/linux/.../hd.c

Doing such things on my ULTRIX system at work find finds only one of them -
which makes more sense to me.

     I've seen this posted a couple times and I might as well post
my experiences with the problem...

     I got both the above error and the problem with gcc just sitting
there and doing nothing, then dying when I tried to install the new
version of gcc 2.0 from dec1.eecs.wsu.edu.  I got really scared when I
tried to re-install the old version I had and found out that IT didn't
work anymore.  After going through much agony not having a compiler to
use I figured out that tar was corrupting files and was able to get
good copies of the files that were bad in gcc and replace them, so far
things have worked great.

     Needless to say I decided to recompile tar, so I got tar-1.10
from prep, but there was one little problem...to recompile tar I had
to have a working tar to untar the thing...the old version died with a
segmentation fault when trying to untar the tar-1.10 archive.  After
finally getting tar recompiled it's worked fine, both the gcc archives
and the tar-1.10 archive came out with no problems.

     The problem with tar only showed up when I started running 0.95a,
before that I had no problems at all with it.  I'm running a 0.95a
system with the 0.95 ps patches and the 0.12 lp patches on a 

386/40 Opti chipset
4MB ram
2MB swap file
40 meg partition on 120 meg IDE drive

the 40 meg partition I'm using for linux is getting a little scarce of
space, only about 8 megs left.  I also tried the distribution
bootimage for 0.95 and 0.12 and tar still did the same things.  When I
ran tar it seemed to gobble up all available system ram, causing
anything e lse to be swapped out, if I did anything on another VC
there  was a distinct wait until things registered.  Does anyone have
any ideas why tar decided to break?

If I've previously written a tar file to a floppy and then subsequently want
to write a shorter one, will the EOF work, or will the poor beast get confused
and untar the original file and then whatever is left over into gibberish?

I know, I know, if I tried it I'd find out, but I'm not at home now and I too
was under the impression that I had to reformat for each new tarfile.

I think the same sort of problem occurs with INTR and QUIT.  Stop screen
output with ^S and then try ^C^C and you hang the terminal.  Unfortunately
I don't have the POSIX standard to check this out, but I think INTR and
QUIT should set tty->stopped=0.

Greetings,
    Well now, that all depends on whether you want Linux to remain
forever popular only among hacker-types.  I think that it should always
be POSSIBLE to innovate under Linux, but that the basic system should
be as conservative as possible.  The reason is to sway/attract the
non-code-hacker types to the OS as something stable and powerful.

    Hell, right now Linux works better than 386BSD...  386BSD has more
POWER, but less USABILITY.  All we need to do is bring Linux up to that
level of power, without sacraficing usability, before 386BSD gets to a
reasonable level of usability.  *gr'yn*

    I'm not sure what the future holds, but whatever it is it's very
very bright for free operating systems.  I'm not sure that Coherent
386 will be able to survive in this type of environment...

    I'd like to point out that what Mr. Battle was suggesting is extremely
similar to the situation which occurred with BSDI and the Net/2 distribution
of BSD Unix.  The situation COULD be the same, if Mr. Battle decided to invest
a great deal of energy, completeing the Linux transition to a commercial class
OS, but making the decision to *NOT* release his code.  Thus he would be
offerin an encumbered version of Linux, but he'd be able to name his price
because the current version of Linux wouldn't have all the features (like X)
that he'd add in.

    However, this is an extremely larger effort than what I gleaned that
Mr. Battle was interested in.  Substantially uninteresting to the quick buck
mindset, I think...
