I have uploaded the root image for Linux v0.95a to nic.funet.fi.  As
with the bootimage, you will have to wait for it to be moved to an
accesible directory.  (I assume it will be moved over at the same time
as the bootimage.)

A summary of the changes has been included in the file CHANGES-0.95a,
also uploaded, and is also included below.  There is also an
INSTALL-0.95a, which I have not posted below since it is largely a
rehash of INSTALL-0.11 and RELNOTES-0.95.

As Linus has said, these files will available in a day or two from
nic.funet.fi, and an announcement will be made when that happens.
They will be available on the other sites shortly after that.

CHANGES IN THE LINUX v0.95a ROOT DISKETTE
Jim Winstead Jr. - March 17, 1992

This file mostly contains info about the changes in the root diskette
from Linux v0.95/0.12 to Linux v0.95a.

CHANGES

With the release of Linux v0.95a, the maintenance of the root diskette
has been assumed by Jim Winstead Jr. (jwinstea@jarthur.Claremont.EDU).
This means there are a few large changes between the Linux 0.95 and
0.12 root floppies and the Linux 0.95a root floppy.  These are
detailed (as much as I remember them) below:

-       'bash' has been replaced with 'ash', the BSD 4.3 /bin/sh.  This
        freed up nearly 200k on the root floppy.  However, there are
        some problems with 'ash' that haven't been resolved:

        - sometimes the backspace key will not work on a virtual
          console.  I've found that it usually works on all _but_ one
          console, so this is only a minor hinderance.

        - 'ash 'supports BSD-style job control, and this has not yet been
          adapted to Linux's more POSIXish job control.  This means
          that 'ash' does not yet support job control, but it's being
          worked upon.

-       'tar' and 'compress' are back on the root floppy.  'tar' is
        compressed, and both utilities are in /bin.

-       'pfdisk', a disk partitioner, was added to the root floppy.
        This makes it (almost) possible to install Linux on a machine
        without looking at another OS.

-       the file pager 'more' has been added to the floppy.  This was
        added because of the addition of some documentation files on
        the root floppy.

-       'cat' has been added to /bin.

-       many utilities have been moved from /usr/bin to /bin, to
        conform to the Linux Directory Structure Standard (v1.0).
        These utilities are ones that are 'vital to the restoration of
        other file systems in the case of a corrupting crash.'

-       'init' and 'update' have been moved to /etc from /bin.  This
        was done because neither program should be executed from the
        command line by any user, including root.  (That means don't
        put /etc in your PATH!)  This has been a matter of some
        controversy, but this is how it will stand until the Linux
        Standards mailing list/committee decides otherwise.

-       tty64, tty65, etc, have been renamed to ttys1, ttys2, etc.

-       the directory /INSTALL was added, which contains some
        documentation, and three simple shell scripts to make
        installing Linux on a hard drive partition easier.  These are:

        - 'mktree', which makes a directory tree on the specified
          mounted device.
        - 'mkdev' which creates the standard devices in the dev
          directory of the specified mounted device
        - 'install' which installs the programs on the root diskette
          to the specified mounted device

        These programs will normally be called with '<name> /mnt'.

-       rootdev is different than the one on v0.95.  A couple of days
        after the release of 0.95, a program called 'rdev' was posted
        to alt.os.linux that duplicated and extended the functionality
        of rootdev.  This was renamed to rootdev and replaces the old
        rootdev.

-       agetty was renamed to getty, to be consistent with common Unix
        practice.

-       an improved fdisk was added that correctly reports extended
        partitions,  (Thanks to Linus!)

-       /dev is complete, or at least more complete than the last few
        releases of the root diskette, which always seemed to be a
        major complaint.  :)

-       /etc/issue and /etc/motd have been expanded to be a little
        more informative.  (Yeah, I know, big deal! :)

-       chgrp was removed.  You can use chown to get the same effect,
        but you just have to specify an owner, too.

Many of these changes were discussed on alt.os.linux, or the Linux
Standards group, so they may look familiar.

If you have questions, problems, or complaints about the root
diskette, either post to alt.os.linux, or send mail to me at
jwinstea@jarthur.Claremont.EDU. 

If you have questions, problems, or complaints about the boot diskette
or the kernel itself, post to alt.os.linux or send mail to Linus
Torvalds at torvalds@cc.helsinki.fi.

Remember, the only stupid questions are the ones you don't ask.

FUTURE CHANGES

I'm already anticipating some changes for the next release, so here's
a sneak preview:

-       shared libraries.  These are currently in alpha testing, and
        will hopefully free up some more room on the root floppy for
        more goodies.

-       a generic mtools might be added to the root floppy.

-       a better fdisk to replace the current fdisk/pfdisk pair.  You
        won't need to know your drive's geometry for this, and it will
        know about Linux extended partitions.

-       an improved sh.  I'm working on the backspace problem, and
        adding job control.  I'm also going to look at using the GNU
        readline library for input, as long as it doesn't add
        substantially to the size of sh.

-       init/getty/login may be removed from the root floppy.  The
        main reason they'll still on there is the backspace problem
        with ash.

-       improved installation documentation.  People have started work
        on this already - read alt.os.linux for previews.

-       more robust installation scripts.  The current ones are quick
        and dirty, and work well, but I'd like to add better ones.

-       miscellaneous utilities added.  I'd really like to add an
        editor to the root disk, but I haven't found one small enough.
        Any suggestions?

-       various other things that I can't remember right now.

Again, mail your questions, comments and suggestions about the root
diskette to me at jwinstea@jarthur.Claremont.EDU.

Unfortunately, SCSI support did not make it into .95a.  However, there are 
clean diffs against .95.  The code autodetects too, and can run in non-scsi
systems so it will be possible to include SCSI support in the standard
distribution.

Currently, the only finished low-level driver is for the seagate 
SCSI hosts. Dave Gentzel is currently testing his Ultrastor driver - 
so it should become part of the SCSI distribution soon. 

I don't know the status of the Adaptec driver, and the DTC / future 
domain drivers are student projects and therefore subject to spring 
break.

Ok, this is probabally an FAQ, but I'm trying to find the correct rawrite
file to write the disk images. My rawrite that I found will only work
with a 360k (yeah right) drive. All I have is a 1.44 drive, and it won't
let me format it to 360. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I am new
to seting up a unixlike os, but can't even get started without the flopies!

mkfs verifies #blocks <= 65536.  Unfortunately if #blocks == 65536, the nzones
field in the superblock wraps to 0 and mkfs fails complaining that there are
not enough good blocks.

*That* would be wonderful.  Not using version control will result in a
situation like we have with MINIX: awful and uncontrolable.  I highly
recommend using version control, because there are so many people
working on Linux, that we might get a similar situation if Linus stops
administrating everything.

Subject: Help!  Can't create file system..


        I (finally) got Linux 0.95 to actually boot, but I'm having problems
creating the file system with mkfs on my hard drive.  I've tried about
every possible combination of partition-types - even formatting the
entire drive and giving linux the first primary partition.  I still get
errors though.


First, when booting and right before (maybe right after) the opening
"Welcome to Linux 0.95" message (or whatever) I get:

_setutent: can't open utmp files: no such file or directory
_setutent: can't open utmp files: no such file or directory


(yes, twice).  fdisk seems to run fine, as does mkfs.  Once I run mount
though, no matter which options or device I use, I get:

mount: unable to open lock-file

If I try it a second time it doesn't even check the disk (in a buffer or
something?).  I suspect that this is not a problem with the actual
partition - I don't really see what could be wrong.  

Any suggestions????

Subject: More testing + malloc considerations + tape + ....
Date: 18 Mar 92 08:37:32 GMT

I spent some more time on testing the version .95 of linux. I am a bit
amazed that I haven't wiped my HD yet :-) Anyway, here goes:

1) Got the new PS.95 compiled succesfully after having patched, no fuss
   no problem with the patches. Try to load the new kernel and this is what
   I got:
   .........
   ..........
   Free mem:3407872
   hardisk I/O error
   dev 0342 block 24576
   hardisk I/O error
   dev 0342 block 24576
   hardisk I/O error
   dev 0342 block 24576
   general protection ffd0
   EIP :0008:000000c187
   ....
   PID:1 process:1

   Not very nice. I must say that I have some "unespected HD interrupt" 
   sometime but I newer got this before :-( Some strange interaction between 
   the patches and my HD ....

2) The backup story....
   I managed to have tar write multiple floppyes using
   tar -cvf /dev/PS0 -L 2730 -z .
   The point was to understand that the length is in blocks of 512 bytes.
   The problem is that I can't do  a restore yet :-)
   I tried with:
   tar -xvf /dev/PS0 -M -Z
   But after the first disk tar doesn't stop and ask for the second...
   Any idea ?

3) What happen if.....
   I change one of the shared executables on the fly ?
   Ex: I got the new bash. I was logged is as root and i changed the 
   old bash with the new bash. It was not possible to use the new bash
   until the old bash exited. ( At least this is what it seemed to happen )
   I don't know how the sharing works... I am just thinking that if the
   system do not realize that a the program has changed and try to load
   bits of the program from what it thinks is the old file some strange 
   things can happen....
   How is the system supposed to react in an event of executable change 
   while the executable is still in use ? ( and possibly shared )

4) I understand the idea behind the malloc syscall...
   It is the same idea behind the mach OS.. :-) The point is that I think
   the the OS does not react in a good way when tryng to access all the pages
   that are supposed to be there. It become veeeery slow and seem to be frozen.
   Also the offending process doesn't seem to go avay...
   I am not shure that the mach idea is a good one. From one side it is really
   nice. It allows you to have very sparse databases in a machine.
   On the other side there is the problem that a resource like memory
   is newer completly granted to a process. 
   Ex: My program not only has to check for
       if ( (ptr=(char *)malloc (bignum)) == NULL )   
   But also it has to check for possible memory faults during execution even
   if the allocated area is supposed to be there.....
   Anybody has some opinion about it ?
   I vould like to be able to choose.... Something like
   malloc ();   /* Returns a pointer to an ALWAYS available memory area */
   mmalloc ();  /* Returns a pointer to a NOT ALWAYS available memory   */ 
       
5) This has nothing to do with linux testing, or maybe a little :-)
   With all this testing I have to have a backup...
   Now, floppy are a bit exepnsive if you start to need many of them 
   compared to a tape. I was thinking that I may be able to 
   afford to buy a small tape ( The QIC10 ) It is supposed to 
   be a 120Mb and the tapes cost very little if compared to the
   cost of the equivalent in floppyes. In the long term tape is cheap :-)
   Anyway. The point is:
   Anybody know how the beast can be accessed from linux ?
   ( It is supposed to work using the floppy interface... but it is NOT
     a floppy. So, how does it works ? Will it work with linux ? ( I bet no ))
   If it will not work with linux, anybody can point me in the direction
   where I can find informations on the format of the commands ?

6) Sorry, again with ftp-sites :-( Last posting about this !
   Ftp sites. I haven't received any complains about the idea of having
   a separate subtree for each release of linux. Each subtree will contains
   ONLY the NEW stuff that is released for that release. NO symlinks to OLD
   stuff. NO old stuff anyway. This will keep the naming consistent
   ( No INSTALL.12 INSTALL.95 ... but jsust INSTALL ) The same apply for
   each new release of cc, nroff, X11 and so on
   It is easier to know what is new ( just have a look at the latest release )
   The work for the ftp admin is reduced since what you have to do is just
   put the new stuff into the current release. No messing around with name 
   clashing...
   Anybody like the idea ?. Too much work ?. Not worth it ?....
   
7) Last bit.
   I follow a bit amused the various articles that got posted in alt.os.linux
   The most amusing are the one that ask if it is possible to add this and 
   that to Linux. I wonder if the poster of such articles had ever had 
   ours of work zapped because the OS...
   As I said before. It is possible to implement compression on the fly,
   DOS emulators, and anything you like. The point is that this is not
   the right moment. It is COMPLICATED to get an OS up and running.
   Linux has done a GREAT job but to be able to continue the system HAS
   to remain simple ! ( At least until it get a bit more stable )
   And even then there are better things to do:
   Shared libraryes ( this will save a LOT of disk space )
   IPC ....
   TCP/IP....
   X11....
   I think that the system is already too overloaded with "unneeded" stuff
   ( ok ok, now many of you will write BY MAIL the reason that the following
     stuff is absolutely needed :-) )
   Ex:
   exec of files beginning with #!/bin/sh
      This has reported to be buggy. Linux can spend time to debug the HD
      code or do something else if this is not required.
      If you absolutely need that you can just do a system from inside
      you executable ( just for now, in the future it may be back )  
   Swap on a file.
      I don't know if this is related with the malloc problems I think
      that having a partition for swap is much safer than having a file
      It should also be faster....
      Most unices swap on a separate partition. Some of the new ones swap
      on a file too. Let's give Linux time to fix other stuff before
      adding this bit.
   Symlinks
      Yes, we need them to fix programs that want to be where they should not
      be... But one symmlink is enought. Isn't it ?
      ( Yes yes, I already ear the letters arriving..... )      
   Ok. it's all ! Before you post a reply sayng that all this stuff is needed
   just remembar that:
   I am not sayng that it is not useful. I am sayng that we can wait a bit 
   for it and give time to linux to fix other bugs...
   Seems reasonable to me :-)

As the author of the aha1542 driver for I suppose I better answer.
I've written a driver for Linux-0.12. I still needs to be integrated
into the stuff drew wrote and thus be adapted to 0.95[a].

I very pressed with time at present, but will, if nobody else will 8^),
eventually do it.
