Sorry for the beginner type question:  I ftpmail to a VAX/VMS, then
kermit to a pc.  The uudecode part seems to work ok; rootimag.z comes
out to a little over 500k.  Then my decompress program (comp430d) quits
after producing a file a little over 600k and says:

 ''comp430d:  bad file token in rootimag.z''.

Anyone seen this before or have any idea?

No No No. 
Do not believe anything anyone will tell out about X running without TCP
It will not. If they say so make them prove it.

I do not think this is true for every file in Minix. Many commands are
or are derived from public domain code. I think the Minix people should
be clearly marking the public domain code from the copyrighted code.

I'm the person who wrote all of the speedup routines of SpeedUp (currently
at 1.0.2), an (much) enhanced X11R5 server for ET4000 boards running 386
UNIXes (currently only Sys5r4s).  It is rated at 6,275 XStones in 1024x768x256
mode; this is significantly faster than the X386 1.2 server (but then 1.2 is
ridiculously slow) that comes with the X11R5 distribution, and is from 30% to
80% faster than X386 1.1b (what the README above was referring to) for the
operations I've sped up.  The measurements were done on a 33-MHz 386 + Cyrix
83D87 and a 32-K cache.

X11R5 can use TCP/IP connection, UNIX connection, or DECNET connection.  To
support X, the least painless way is to get UNIX domain sockets (and STREAMS)
to work; they also give you better performance (but don't screw them up like
Sys5r4.03 does).  If anyone needs to use X across a network, the TCP/IP stuff
can be added later.  I don't see any good reason to add DECNET support.

X11R5 needs a tremendous amount of memory.  I use shared libs and an X session
with an Emacs and an xterm (together with SpeedUp, the Sys5r4 kernel, and the
normal daemons) uses about 6M.  As you start up more X clients, memory will
start to become a problem.  To support X, it's best to break the 16-M barrier
(  :-)  ), and make shared libs a part of Linux (for doing Linux development,
don't use shared libs, as they tend to break lots of code).

A friend introduced Linux to me, so if I somehow get the money to buy an extra
(and large) disk and someone writes a SCSI driver for the Future Domain 860, I'd
like to start to use it (and most likely do some work on X11R5 if someone would
port it to Linux first).  I'm currently using ESIX 4.03A.

I dont know how the rest of you are set up and I'm not terribly well up on how news works anyway, but I understand that here in Belgium the news feed is direct from the States onto a backbone. The transport cost is shared by all who take a feed from the backbone - because of this, the feed is particularly selective and we dont see half the stuff we might like to, alt.os.linux included (democracy in action).

I uploaded the improved floppy driver to tsx-11.mit.edu, this allows you to
format floppies as well as greatly speeding up reads. It may still have some
problems expecially when comes to more than one floppy drive (I only have
one), if it does weird things tell me :) Unfortunitly the documentation for
the chip is dreadful at best, so god only knows what other things will crop up
on slightly different floppy controllers.

I was trying it with gnu multiple volume backups, it makes them fine but gnu
tar bombs out instead of asking you for the next volume when reading them.
I decided not to bother with auto format devices since you can always switch
to another console and run format when needed.

The file is fd.tar.Z, unfortunitly I don't know how you make patch files so
it has a copy of all the modified files, eventhough most have only trivial
changes.

Subject: PD tar on Linux?
Reply-To: ajh@gec-mrc.co.uk
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 1992 09:21:08 GMT

I haven't seen this mentioned, in the last <n> months anyway, so thought I
would mention it...  Somebody pointed out recently the problem of backing up
from a Linux partition onto floppy disks, particularly since the tar that comes
with Linux can't handle multiple volumes. I dug out an MS-DOS port of the PD
tar, which I grabbed (with source) quite some time ago. Here's an excerpt from
the README:

"This is a public domain tar(1) replacement.  It implements the 'c',
 'x', and 't' commands of Unix tar, and many of the options.  It creates
 P1003 "Unix Standard" [draft 6] tapes by default, and can read and
 write both old and new formats.  It can decompress tar archives when
 reading them from disk files (using the 'z' option), but cannot do so
 when writing, or when reading from a tape drive.  Its verbose output
 looks more like "ls -l" than the Unix tar, and even lines up the
 columns.  It is a little better at reading damaged tapes than Unix tar."

I have used it quite happily to extract tar files created on a Unix system.
Now, the interesting thing is that it can also write to the floppy device
directly, using BIOS calls in (presumably) much the same way as rawrite, *and*
it can handle multiple volumes. It has options -V to set the volume name (eg.
A) and -S to specify the volume size. I tried to write an archive onto floppy
in this way, and then read it using the usual `tar xvf /dev/fd0...' on Linux.
However, Linux tar barfs and says `skipping to next file header' after
extracting the first file (the `diff' binary in this case). The file ends up
with the right size under Linux, but differs from the `proper' version after
about 3000 bytes or so. There is something subtle going on, apparently.

However, apart from its possible utility in transferring files between
MSDOS/Linux partitions conveniently, a port to Linux might be useful. The
notes that come with the PD tar say that a port to Minix was done, but was
dropped; the reason given being:

"Due to an extreme lack of interest (I would almost say aggressive
 disinterest) on the part of Minix users, I no longer support the tar
 port for Minix outside IDA.  The Minix port has not been beta tested
 as well as I would like due to the difficulty in finding Minix beta
 testers; however, the DOS port has been tested extensively at several
 locations for transferring files between DOS and Unix."

I'll try compiling it with gcc and see what develops. If anyone else thinks it
could be of any use at all, drop me a line. Or stop me if you've tried all
this already...

Here (well on alt.sources, anyway) is what I think (hope) will be the last
version of JOE before the rewrite (version 1.0.0).  This version includes
some quick fixes and additions to the previous one: 

        * undo/redo are now a real undo system instead of undelete

        * keyboard macros added

        * repeat prefix added

        * capture shell output and pipe block through shell command added

        * A version for Linux is now included

        * Simple macros may be specified in the .joerc file

        * Some bugs in the paragraph reformat routine were fixed

        * The right margin may be specified in the .joerc file

        * A bug where strange things would happen if you typed \ in the
          search & replace prompt is fixed

I have time now so I should be able to come out with the rewrite real-soon. 
Oh, and it looks like it will have a macro language.  It's going to be C
except that the C pointers will be buffer pointers.  This won't make it more
complicated to use- the only change I envision beyond what's in 0.1.2 is
that ^K L will be able to take vi-style regular expressions and editor
commands.
