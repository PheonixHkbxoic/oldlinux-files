I was having this problem too but it turned out that I wasn't using Kermit
right...you have to set file type binary on both the local and remote copies
of kermit...the easiest way to get all the parameters correct on both sides
is to have the same .kermrc file in your home dirs...on both Linux and the

Hummm... lots of people are still asking a question on the screen business
(virtual consoles)

Presently the copy of linux that is running on one of the poly's 386's
automatically boots up a second screen which can be axcess by typing in
(Alt-(f1/f2)) as the system is supporting only 2 virtual consoles.

the first screen exists on tty1 and the second on tty2 (f1/f2)
fine but when you use alt-f2 you only see a blank screen. Ok thats right
because tha second screen doesn't run a shell on bootup. Manually you
can start one by entering 

        doshell /dev/tty2 sh &

ie 'execute a shell on device tty2 (second screen) using shell (or any other
shell you wish for) and execute it in the background'

if you type 'jobs' you should see the above line running and a swap to the
second screen will show a nice friendly bash# or other prompt.

to boot the shell on startup, just copy the above line into the /etc/rc file
in which case the shell will not show up in the tty1 jobs list.

In fact you can extend this principal into the com ports.
eg doshell /dev/tty64 sh & will start up a shell on the com port and allow
myself and a friend to interactively use the machine at the same time.
(We can both axcess the hd at the same time but boy does it trash!)
we can both set up jobs in the background etc...

unfortunately you will probably need 'stty' from tsx-11.mit.edu as the inital
link is at 2400 baud which you can then boost to 115200 (max?). echo,
lf->cr or lf->crlf etc have probably got to be setup to.
(a manual page on stty is a must!)

REQUEST: although i am quite happy with the way that linux works with it's
assigned devices, I am quite unable to compile mtools. i can compile to the 
object files but once the linker kicks in, it complains that __strncpy__
and a host of other functions are referanced from text segments which to me
looks like the library is trashed (mind you nearly EVERYTHING else that i've
compiled before compiles and runns fine). Has anyone else come across this?
how do you solve it? Also, what headway has been made with ethernet-board 
support (most notably tcp/ip support)

        I'm interested in running linux but I do not want to turn my back 
on my large investment in MS-DOS, at least not yet.
        I'd like to be able to have linux in one partition, DOS in the 
other and select which OS to boot at startup.  Can this be done, and if 
so, how?  (Even better would be a DOS emulator that ran under linux, like
SCO Unix has, but I won't push my luck...)

Subject: Problems getting started
Date: Tue, 28 Jan 92 10:25:30 EST

I download all the files under linux/INSTALL on tsx-11.mti.edu.
I made the boot and root disks (onto 1.2 meg floppies), but I never
made it to the root disk.  When starting up it displays:
   Loading........ etc...
Then it asks to press enter for SVGA mode, or any key to continue.
If I press enter it lets me pick out of a couple of choices.  After
pressing enter or selecting the text mode the screen clears and the
machine reboots.

I also tried it on another 386 with a VGA card, and after the
Loading...... it put a message and cleared the screen and rebooted before
I could read the message or do anything.

Any suggestions?

P.S.  I tried redownloading the images and remaking the boot disk, but
it didn't help.

Is it possible to make the boot disk from scratch?  If so, I could always
put some code in to better determine where it is crashing.

I think that we should develop standards/recommendations for most things, like:
kernel patches, portede programs, directory structure, and so on. It would
ease the cooperations a lot. Of course, these are not enforceable.

Alan B Clegg writes:

   Yes, there is an absolutely right place.  We just have to create it.
   Obvisously, cat, dd, and related programs belong in /bin.  mtools, less,
   and relatives belong in /usr/local/bin.  Now, do we cross-link /usr/bin and
   /bin like SunOS has done?

Not if it can be avoided. But what is the real difference between /bin
and /usr/bin?

   I would like to form a mailing list of people that are interested
   in helping out in setting some standards for directory locations.  The
   current state of affairs *MUST NOT CONTINUE*

Hear! Hear!

   I have created a file system mirror on banjo.concert.net in
   ~ftp/pub/Linux/Release with what I think the file system should look like.
    Please look it over!

Well, things like lesskey.man less.hlp zip* unzip mkdir mkfifo ..
surely doesn't belong in /usr/bin. The available less is configured
wrongly. less.hlp belongs, I think, in /usr/local/lib/less.hlp

zip* unzip in /usr/local/bin

mkdir mkfifo in /bin

AND NO link to any of these

Personally, I think that we should try to put things where they belong under a
"normal" unix, including any of the GNU utilities. We don't need any
/usr/local/gnu or /usr/gnu dirs, they are only for sites having the gnu stuff
as an alternative to the standard utilities. We should also avoid gxxx, like
in gld, perhaps with the notable exection of gcc.

   Yes.  Every tar file should contain information on where the binaries and
   source should live.  Many of the current binary distributions were created
   from the file system root (tar cf thing.tar /usr/bin/thing*) and
   that is *NOT* acceptible [IMHO, of course].

We need to make installation REAL SIMPLE AND FAST. I suggest the
following standard for distributing ported programs.

Everything should be contained in a [compressed] tar file with a:

  - README, a short explanations of how this version differs from
    the original, if it does, and how it was compiled.

  - PREREQUIST, again which kernel, but also which version of the
    original.

  - Makefile, not for compilation, but for installation!! After having
    checked that you agree with paths and so, you just type 'make install'
    perhaps as root.

  - Patches, context diff against the original.

  - Binaries

  - Optionally, manual pages, also with full path.

Kernel patches should also be a [compressed] tar file containing:

  - README, describing what the patch does/is.
  - PREREQUIST, a precise statement of which version of the
    kernel the patches applies, and which, if any, patches that
    was already applied.

Sources belong in /usr/src, linux sources in /usr/src/linux, etc.

Maybe we should split patches and binaries, but I don't like that, as you
would properbly end up having only one of either.

I've also had problems with the fd patches. everything seemed to be OK until I
tried to fsck a floppy. It came up with a load of read errors and I had to
Ctrl-C it. As I've never had any incompatibility problems with my machine,
either I've made a mistake installing the patches or there's a bug somewhere.
Anyone else had problems?

Let me add my few cents here. If I am correct, shoelace was originally created
to be used with minix and thus understands the way partition table is stored
by fdisk that comes with minix (which I believe sorts the table before writing
to the disk). This probably is incompatible with the way Linux thinks how the
partitions should be mapped to minor dev numbers. So if you created partitions
with the minix fdisk (I am not suggesting you to go and buy minix, but...)
then you don't have any problem at all (like me :-)

   I may be way off base, but...  My display is NOT a tty anyway.  It seems
   to me that tty devices should be serial ports of which you may connect a
   real tty to it, or modem, or other serial device.  

What's in a name?  I don't think most of us have used a system were a
teletype has been hooked up a Unix machine in a long time.  :-)
What makes a modem "more" of a tty device than a display?

   Maybe we should use something else for the console, such as, /dev/vga.
   IBM uses /dev/hft# for display devices.  Or maybe, /dev/con.

Blech.  :-)     But that's just my personal opinion.  In any case, it's
probably not worth arguing about them.  People can rename their devices
to whatever they want, including /dev/basingstoke if it tickles their
fancy.

/dev/console should probably exist, but it should be a pseudo device
which can be redirected from /dev/tty1 to a pty, so that once we get X
running, an X console program can redirect the console messages to a
console window.

I am using DOS 5.0 and am having difficulty installing LINUX. As Linus
notes in the INSTALL docs, newer versions of DOS (4.X, 5.X) include an
FDISK that only allows one primary partition. He suggests using EDPART.
The problem is that EDPART is very old and only allows partitions of 32 Meg
or less. I have a 100 Meg hard drive and want 80 Megs for DOS and 20 Megs

From: hedrick@dumas.rutgers.edu (Charles Hedrick)
Subject: random historical lore (directory locations, sync)
Date: 28 Jan 92 17:38:48 GMT

A couple of questions in this group are related to Unix history that
it seems worth explaining:

At some point somebody asked about doing sync more than once.
Traditionally before taking down a system people type sync three
times.  There is actually a reason.  The first sync simply scheduled
all dirty blocks for writing.  But it didn't wait for them all to be
written.  However a second sync would block until the first one had
finished, i.e. all dirty blocks had actually been written out.  So if
you wanted to make sure the disk was up to date, you had to do two
syncs.  Why 3 rather than 2 I couldn't say though.

Recently somebody was asking where to put binaries.  The question was
whether to abandon the distinction betweeen /bin and /usr/bin, as
SunOS has done.  I'm not sure what I think, but let me suggest reasons
why the current structure might still make sense.  In older systems, I
can think of two reasons for having separate /bin and /usr/bin: (1)
Because non-BSD systems search their directories linearly, you don't
want a commonly used directory to get too big.  By putting the most
common programs like "ls" and "pwd" in /bin, you avoid having to
search through a single huge directory.  Indeed the suggestion is that
no directory should be allowed to grow too large, so if you have lots
of utilities, splitting them into /usr/bin, /usr/gnu/bin, etc., might
make sense.  (2) Most Unix systems had more than one partition.  The
root partition was kept small, and had only the most essential files
and programs.  The idea was to minimize the likelihood of file system
damage on root in a crash by keeping it small (and ideally having no
files on it that changed regularly -- /etc/wtmp and /etc/utmp of
course violated this, but they could be symlinks to /usr/adm).
However the root file system should have all the tools that would be
needed in doing file system diagnosis and repair, so that if /usr was
damaged, you could fix it with tools on root.

SunOS ended up getting rid of /bin, making it simply a symlink
to /usr/bin.  There were several reasons for this:
  - under BSD, the directories are not searched linearly, so
        you can handle bigger directories.
  - /usr is intended to have only things that don't change, so
        it can be mounted readonly.  Since nothing on it is
        changing, there isn't much chance of file system
        damage in a crash.  Thus tools are actually safer on
        /usr than root, even through /usr is bigger.  This was
        a consequence of the split into /usr and /var, which
        was done to allow readonly mounting of /usr.

Linux is probably closer to a traditional Unix system than to SunOS.
It does search directories linearly, and /usr typically has files that
change.  Thus the original arguments for a separate /bin still make
sense.  In fact there's now a new one: for ease of installation and
diagnosis of damaged disks, you really want to have a reasonable
subset of software on a floppy.  I'd suggest that having /bin be the
utilities that we want to be on the floppy, and /usr/bin be everything
else.  I do not suggest using /sbin.  /sbin is really only software
for use in single-user or during boot.  It's not normally even on the
PATH, so it would typically contain duplicate copies of essential
binaries (except maybe for init, which is only needed during boot).
You only need it if you get rid of /bin and move all executables to
/usr/bin.  I don't think that's something we need to do.

By the way, I'm against using /usr/local/bin for standard system
software.  The whole point of /usr/local is that it's an area for
software supplied by the site.  The separation makes new releases
easier to install: you can just replace /usr/bin with the contents of
the new release.  Since everything installed by the site is on
/usr/local, blowing away /usr/bin and replacing it with software from
the new release won't hurt you.  Having standard parts of Linux be on
/usr/local defeats the purpose: /usr/local is local.  No operating
system vendor should ever put stuff there.

Also, I'd like to put in a plug for avoiding the Gnu convention of
starting everything with g's.  When I put up the man pages, I noticed
that the man pages had the Gnu names: gcp instead of cp, grm instead
of rm, etc.  This makes sense in the usual Gnu environment.  Since
there isn't yet a GnuOS, most Gnu utilities are optional extras which
will coexist with standard utilities from the vendor.  Then "cp" is
the normal system "cp" from Sun or whoever, and gcp is the Gnu
version.  But for Linux, the Gnu utilities are the the basic ones that
come with the system.  Thus they should be given the basic names.  I
don't really want all the commands to start with g.
