Call me stupid (please, no mails addressed to stupid :-) ) but I'm having
a
few problems installing the Gcc binaries under Linux...  I can tar
them across, and have them sittig in my work directory, and can 
use Gcc-Ar to unarchive the library';s etc, but just wondering WHERE DO THEY
GO?

Ie, is there a directory structure that is required?  If not, can anyone 
suggest something because I don';;t like having everything in one

Ouch you seem to be ahead of me.  I just got it to compile, and I do not have a
tty5, so I removed it from inittab, when I boot up, it just sits there.  So I
reload it, and make a symbolic link between tty5 and tty1, the problem is now
that when I do login, I'm on as a dumbterminal with funky key settings, any
idea how to get it to work right?

I don't know if this is maybe fixed in the latest release of poe-IGL, but
I hacked my login so that it grabbed TERM from /etc/inittab.  Seemed like
the logical thing to do.

I have been hacking on linux now for a couple of weeks,
with almost uniformly good results.  I have poe-IGL,
shoelace, mtools, and most other patches etc installed.
I do have two problems though:

1-  I am unable to use 720k disks in my 1.44 meg 3.5 inch 
drive.  I have tried all the likely looking minor
device numbers.  Anyone else get this to work?

2-  How do people backup their systems?  Trying to create
a large tar file either on floppies or to a disk file
almost inevitably locks up my system.  A known 
problem?  Maybe fixed in 0.13? :-)

Well, I too have all files in one dir /usr/gcc so I have a shell script in
/usr/bin that looks like this:
/usr/gcc/gcc -B/usr/gcc/gcc- -I/usr/gcc/include -L/usr/gcc $*
That works okay, but I also have some symbolic links for the programs such
as gcc-ar they are linked to:
gcc-ar
ar
gar
all in /usr/bin (THough the exe itself is in /usr/gcc)

Subject: where's the rename patch?
Date: 22 Feb 92 20:07:09 GMT

The new libc (i.e. the one posted with the new gcc and math lab)
requires the kernel rename system call.  That's not in 0.12, but I
know it was made available as a patch.  I don't see it on either
tsx-11 or banjo.  I'm trying to avoid using the transatlantic links.
Could somebody tell me where it is?

From: hedrick@dumas.rutgers.edu (Charles Hedrick)
Subject: new libc copyright
Date: 22 Feb 92 18:39:05 GMT

I'd like to suggest that people review the dj copying file carefully
before incorporating the new libraries into a release.  I think it's a
bad idea for OS's to have libraries that impose royalties on software
written using them, whether the royalties are monetary or political.
(dj's conditions are a combination.) My suspicion is that if I showed
copying.dj to my lawyer friends, they'd just laugh, but it is still
dangerous.  If it's valid, then technically it's a violation to
distribution Berkeley applications for Linux, since they are not
covered under the GPL.  (They're covered under more liberal licensing.
DJ requires that requiring his code must carry the GPL, a restriction
stronger than the GPL itself.)  We haven't gone through years of
de-ATT'ing systems just to pick up more restrictions.  I've noticed
that there are pretty complete library sources in the Berkeley sources
area on ftp.uu.net.  Indeed most of the supposed djcode is either
trivial or it's Berkeley code with the statement "This file may have
been modified by DJ Delorie...".  I think the concept of saying "This
file may be copyright" is legally dubious.  I would suggest redoing
the new libraries based on the original Berkeley code, unless we're
*really* sure that the dj notices can be ignored.

By the way, in general I support the Gnu Public License.  I do not
support it or similar restrictions in libraries, because that makes it
difficult to write anything other than Gnu code for the system, both
truly restriction-free and commercial.  Recent versions of the GPL
have apparently have improvements for libraries (I can't be sure,
because despite all the Gnu code in Linux, I can't find the GPL
anywhere -- at Rutgers we only seem to have the old version), but
still appear to require special precautions that I suspect many
vendors would not be willing to deal with.  While there are probably
no vendors currently waiting eagerly to port code to Linux, I don't
see any reason to set things up to make that impossible.

Subject: vXprintf doesn't work in new libraries
Date: 22 Feb 92 19:29:02 GMT

The new libraries define vfprintf and friends as expecting multiple
arguments.  Under the old libraries, SunOS, and the new BSD code, they
expect a vararg pointer, i.e. the address of a list of arguments.
This causes the error printer used by the Gnu fileutils (which passes
the address of a list) to print incorrect error messages.  I'll
be including a fixed version of the v..printf functions in a
posting later today (which also includes fixed versions of
functions dealing with timezones -- I've taken the BSD code).

Subject: losing serial input
Date: 23 Feb 92 02:16:22 GMT

A number of people have reported problems with losing serial input.  I
see it with both kermit and ka9q, even when nothing else is going on,
but more severely when anything is happening in another window.  I've
looked into it a bit more, and have found at least two separate
problems.  First, it appears that input interrupts are being missed.
We've talked about a solution: queuing the copy_to_cooked, rather than
doing it directly from interrupt level.  This doesn't solve the
problem.  In fact it looks like do_timer is simply running too long
with interrupts disabled.  At least if I understand what's going on,
an interrupt gate disables interrupts, i.e. acts like cli.  Thus all
of do_timer is running with interrupts off.  By putting an sti() at
the beginning of do_timer, and putting cli/sti around things in it
that I thought might need it, I've made it so that I can ftp files
reliability, as long as nothing else is going on.  However if anything
is going on in another fork, this loses big.  Apparently the
scheduling mechanism is working OK, because I can interrupt the
process and get to the command level in ka9q.  So the select is
responding immediately.  But it seems like there's a very high
character drop rate.  This is true whether the competing task is doing
I/O or not.  I tried a simple loop in the shell, with
   while :
   do
   :
   done
That brings the file transfer to a screeching halt.

Linus indicated that he thought he had fixed this for 0.13.  If he's
willing to send me the changes via email, I'd be interested to try
them.

Hi,

I've just started playing around with Linux - looks very nice.  

When I tried to install it on my second hard disk however I ran into
some problems.

My system configuration is :-
  80364-DX33 with
  Hard drive 0 - Conner CP30104 (120M IDE drive)
  Hard drive 1 - Seagate ST157A (44M IDE drive)

I created a 20M partition on my 2nd drive (split it into 2 - using
edpart, and then later part.exe from pdisk).  When I tried to do a mkfs
from linux, I got the error message 
  "mkfs : cannot open /dev/hd8" (or something like that)

(I have had no hassles creating a filesystem on a 386 in the department
- I have no idea what sort of hard drive it has !)

I know this might well fall into the category of FAQ's, but I have to
limit the transfers I make from tsx-11 (etc) because I'm hogging a lot
of bandwidth on our 9600 baud line (yes South Africa is still in the
dark ages a bit :-)).

Thanks,

Cheers, Geoff.

I think the files in the gcc distribution need to be in /usr/local/bin for gcc
to find them without being told.  However, it's worth making links (symbolic
or otherwise) to anything you'd like to run without running the 'gcc'
command, partticularly gcc-ar (as ar), gcc-ld (as ld) and gcc-cpp (as
cpp), although
there may be others.  Ther links should go somewhere in the path, I used
/usr/gnu/bin since it seemed the most locgical but suit yourself.

This gcc 1.40 and libc.a is just a quick hack to get rid of estdio. I
really don't like them. They will be replaced by 2.0 soon. The stdio
for 2.0 will be based on iostream.

Yes. Add stdio. Please try mlinux if you have a 387. I was told DJ's
copyright notice is funny. The only DJ's code in gcc 2.0 will be just
11 assembler functions in mlinux. They are not very hard to write if
you know some 387. I rewrote the part of mlinux. I hope someone will
finish it. Of courses, they should be at least as good as DJ's code.
Mathlib 2.1 may be a good start.
