  Partition Program Suggestion (Erich Strasburger, Niag.U.)

Hello,

   Just recently got a program called `bootmenu/pfdisk' from plains.nodak.edu
in the pub/alt directory (alt.sources).  This comes with a partitioning
program called pfdisk, and boot sector files bootmenu and bootauto.  The
bootmenu binary allows you to choose the partition you want to boot, the 
bootauto binary defaults to the active partition, but waits 5 seconds in
case you wish to boot one of the others.  I compiled pfdisk under Quick C
2.0, and used it to install the bootxxxx binaries.  They both worked just
fine.  The code says that is can be compiled under ESIX, MSDOS, and I believe
Minix.  I know it works for me with DR DOS 6.0, Coherent, and Linux all
being bootable partitions on my first hard disk (MSDOS 0, Linux /dev/hd0).
Just thought I would post this since I remember there being discussion about
partitioning programs earlier, and also since this code is supposed to compile
under UNIX varients, maybe it can work under Linux? ...haven't tryed, yet.
