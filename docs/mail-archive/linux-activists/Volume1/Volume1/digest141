Subject: Linux in the spirit of the GNU General Public Liscense?
Date: 23 Mar 92 21:15:30 GMT


I have been overwhelmed with the *positive* responses through email to
my offer to provide distribution and support for Linux from those who would
like to have a solid distribution of Linux to play with.  One person (an
obviously-knowledgeable administrator of a largeish network of Unix
workstations) even suggested that this might be worth as much at US$150!!!
This is about 3 times the *maximum* amount I would consider charging!

Thanks to all who responded for your comments.

However, I was astounded at the near-hostile responses I received from
some of the people working on development of Linux (Linus has NOT commented).

I think that the way these developers feel is blasphemy to the GNU GPL.  The
GPL is clearly set up to allow anyone who wants to to provide distribution and
support services *and make a reasonable profit at it* while providing the
users with the assurance of the availability of source code and the right
to make copies.  I'm sure Stallman is happy to have Cygnus Support around to
take some of the hassle of distribution and support off his shoulders.  I'm
sure he's not at all upset that they aren't losing their shirts at it.  In
fact, I'll bet he would be tickled pink if they got filthy rich; it would
just go to show that his philosophy about freely distributable software is
economically viable.

Not so for the Linux developers I've heard from so far.  Unless I'm willing to
contribute my time for free (or at least absurdly cheap) they won't be happy
with me distributing and providing technical support for Linux, notwithstanding
my willingness to contribute back any improvements and/or extensions I make.

Given this, I don't think it is a good idea for me to try to provide this
service.  I would need cooperation (or at least tolerance) from other Linux
developers in order to provide this service effectively, and that doesn't seem
to be forthcoming.

My apologies to those who still have no way of easily and cheaply getting
a complete, timely, and solid distribution of Linux with all the sundry
source and utilities.

My pity on those misguided developers who seem to think that a vow of poverty
is needed from any potential development/distribution/support provider.  If
this attitude becomes prevalent among Linux developers, my prediction is
Linux will die.  It will quickly be replaced by something that people can
make a living developing/distributing/supporting; most likely BSD or GNU.

I would like to know how Linus feels about the distribution/support
situation.  I imagine his feelings would be much more positive.

     I have few questions regarding stuff in linux.  

        1.) Is there a change password binary so one can change a password?  
            I haven't seen it around for linux yet.  

        2.) While inside linux, why can't I clear the screen?  The
            standard command /clear/ does not work.  

        3.) How do I go about in creating a device for the modem so I can

        4.) And one last question for this post:  how do I make linux read
            /bash/ initialization files, if there is any, like .bashrc or

Cygnus does not sell software.  Cygnus Support sells support for software
(and only supports software that's free).

If you wish to sell support for the code, you are more than welcome to.  If
you wish to charge for distribution, it should be a "reasonable" fee (of
course, what's "reasonable"?  I don't know.  Do you?  Does rms?).  The GPL
says, "you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee."
You, however, want to be in the business of distributing the code.  As long
as it's a reasonable rate, I don't think anybody can fault you for it.
(Witness all the [ok, both, that I know if 8-)] Freeware on CD cdroms that
are out there now.  At least one of the people doing it is making a tidy
profit on it; of course, he's also only charghing $20 or so for the cdrom.
If he were charging $500, I suspect he would have very few customers.)

You also seem to want to sell support for it.  That's also, fine.  But are
you *really* surprised when the people you tell this to, people who are
already contributing support and code for free, react negatively?

Cygnus does that:  it sells support.  It also generates a huge amount of
code on the software it supports, and does ports, adds features, etc.  I,
personally, think that's why the free software community approves of cygnus:
yes, it's making money at what it does, but it's also fulfilling all of the
goals of free software, and most of Cygnus' employees are involved for
"religious" (or "moral" or "ethical") reasons.

Is that what you want to do?  Did you want to support Linux because it's a
great system, and you wanted to help contribute to it, and help get other
people using it?  Or were you just in it to make a buck?

Note the followup.

Subject: making the hard drive root after booting from floppy
Date: 23 Mar 92 23:32:47 GMT

Perhaps this is a question for the FAQ, but I was wondering how to detach
the floppy after having booted and re-mounted the hard drive with version
0.95a.  

After booting from a floppy, the root subdirectories are off of the floppy
(ie /bin /usr /dev /etc, etc.), and the hard drive root directories are 
subdirectories off of /mnt.  I would like to cut off the floppy drive and
have the directories on the hard drive as root directories, such that the
standard un*x utilities can be located in the standard places.


Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated (yes, I am converting
from DOS, but am eager to get going in Linux).

1.  You must have created the directory /usr/lib/shared, with an
        appropriate libc.a in it.

2.  The shared library itself must be in /lib

3.  No flags with gcc2 will link shared by default, -static will
        link statically.

If you take the program

main () {puts("Hello World!");}, it should come out to ~5K when linked shared.
That will let you know everything is set up correctly, and that the shared
libraries are being used.

Shared libraries.  Small programs shrink by a factor of 2-3 on 
average, larger programs by ~50K.  it also compiles C++, and replaces
both gcc1.xx and g++1.xx

Seems to be.  There are a few quirks in the include files, but those

Linux eats the first 640K for kernel text (~200K), kernel
data and BSS, and buffercache.  Your mother board may eat up
384K because of a shoddy chipset.  That leaves 1M of memory.

Subtract from that :

init, a shell, update, posibly other daemons like crond.  
You might be down to 600K of real memory left now.


Looking at gcc1.39 , I get

looking at gcc2, I get

You won't have enough space to run gcc in your real memory, will have 
to page heavily (remember, the kernel and buffercache cannot be 
paged), and it will be slow as molasses in january.

Under BSD you can just mount the root partition on the harddisk over /.
Unfortunately this doesn't work on Linux, I just tried it.  You have to
edit the boot disk and tell it to get its initial root from the hard drive.
Instructions are included in the INSTALL directory on the root image for 0.95a.

RAWWRITE writes to a disk that has already been lowlevel formatted. 
From the factory, most disks don't come in this state.  The DOS format
command does a lowlevel and a highlevel format on floppies.

Alternatively, you could use Linux .012 with floppy formatting patches,
or formatted them in any other machine that uses that disk format.

Subject: Experiences installing 0.95a
Date: 24 Mar 92 00:43:41 GMT

I just installed 0.95a on my machine last night.  The installation went
fairly smoothly, and I was impressed with the progress made since the
last release.  However, I did run into a few snags in the process.
I post them here in the hope that pointing them out will lead to them
being more quickly corrected.

* The installation instructions in /INSTALL on the rootimage disk for 0.95a
  refers to a file called pfdisk.man.  I was unable to locate this file.

* The instructions also refer to pboot.exe, which I was unable to locate on
  any of the FTP servers (it may be there, I just couldn't find it).

* pfdisk prints /dev/hd0 as an example.  This should probably be brought
  up to date with the /dev/hda style naming.

* Backspace consistently doesn't work when mounting root on floppy and
  consistently works when mounting root from hard drive.

* Typing ? to more results in a "Can't open help file" error message.
  I was impressed with the full featured "more" on the root disk, however.

* I see Andy Tannenbaum (ast) has an account.

* What's the "--------dummy line" thing at the end of /etc/passwd?
  Perhaps the answer is "so dummy's like you will ask"?

* 64meg partition size limit is very annoying

* Would be nice to have a reboot command so we don't have to sync sync sync.

* The gcc files in newgcc.tar were named cc1 and cpp, but gcc didn't work
  until I renamed them to gcc-cc1 and gcc-cpp.

* I tried to mount the rootimage floppy on /mnt after I got it booting from
  the hard disk (so that I could grab the INSTALL directory which doesn't
  got copied (rightly so)).  However, I got repeated "Reset floppy called"
  messages when I tried to read it.

* I saw an article on comp.unix.bsd telling how to mount a root partition
  from hard disk over / on a floopy disk.  I tried this on Linux, and it
  doesn't work.

On the whole, an excellent job, though.

There was a /bin/passwd on the Linux 0.95 boot floppy.  I took it off
for the 0.95a boot floppy, for space reasons, but you'll eventually be
able to get the binary (and source) seperately, either as part of a
new release of poe's init/getty/login suite, or as the Linux 0.95a
system utilities.

You need to create a small shell script for clear.  Do this:

        cat > /usr/bin/clear
        #! /bin/sh -
        echo ^[[H^[[J
        ^D

^[ means to press the escape key, and ^D means to press Ctrl-D.

There are already devices for the modem - check out /dev/ttys1 and

On login, /bin/bash reads $HOME/.profile, much like standard 'csh'
reads .login and .cshrc.  Also, you're better off using shell
functions instead of aliases, but it's no big deal either way.
