Well, things did not go exactly smooth for me either, but I am up and running
with 0.95.  I FTPed the compressed images directly to my PC under DOS,
uncompressed then under DOS, and wrote them out to floppy disk using RAWRITE.EXE
(same as I did for 0.12).  When I booted from the floppy (Boy, did it ever take
a long time), and swapped in the root disk for the boot disk, it gave me 16
FLOPPY RESET messages (every time!) before it successfully mounted "/" on /dev/at0.

Then I ran fdisk to see what it thought of my hard disks (currently using hd3 as "/"
and hd7 as "/usr").  fdisk listed my disk partitions as:

hda1 = 30404 extended partition (don't use)
hda5 = 30396 16-bit DOS partition
hda7 = 8440 unknown partition type 0xE1 (it's a SSTOR partition on cylinders > 1023)
hda8 = 30455 16-bit DOS partition
hdb1 = 4513 unknown partition type 0xE1
hdb2 = 8143 unknown partition type 0xE1
hdb3 = 32716 unknown partition 0xE4 (another SSTOR partition)
hbd4 = 32716 unknown partition 0xE4

That's different, I have 2 30MB partitions on my first hard disk, but fdisk
seems to think I have 3!  And none of my first disk partitions are extended partitions!
OK, so these look a little different than they did under 0.12, but Linus said he
changed the hard disk devices, so, OK, I'll try and mount the old partitions
under the new (floppy) system using the "new" device names.

Hmmm, mount error trying to mount /dev/hda7.  So I do an ls -l /dev/hd* and
look at the device numbers.  /dev/hda7 is 3,7 and I know I used to use 3,3
under 0.12, so I try mounting /dev/hda3.  IT WORKS!  Sigh!

I have to make (via mknod) /dev/hdb2 so I can mount the "other" disk partition,
and that works too.   Anyone know what's wrong with the "new" fdisk?  My disks
are vanilla 70 and 80 MB MFM, (OK, so both have cylinders > 1023) but they
worked under 0.12, and seem to be working under 0.95 OK too.

And just because I only have 4MB of ram, I did a swapon /dev/hdb1 to use the
partition I ran mkswap on under 0.12.  It seemed to be happy.  So, I copied
(via cp) the new commands over to the harddisks, updated the /dev directory,
fixed up my /etc/rc file, and I'm ready to boot from the harddisk.

OK, back to DOS, re-run my patch program which patches the boot image to use
/dev/hda3 (device 3,3) as the root partition, and I have a floppy boot for
LINUX.  Nope, no floppy resets this way, though I haven't mounted anything
on /dev/at0 yet, and I will tend to write tar files to my 3.5" /dev/PS1
drive when I do that, though using ka9q via SL/IP is my primary download
mechanism these days! (under either DOS or LINUX!)

Another comment, given that we've just seen the "LINUX file system standard"
for directory structure, why doesn't the root disk follow it?  Will
the root disk image for version 1.0 conform to the standard?  For that matter,
the standard should name EVERY file appearing in the root disk, since
they constitute the "standard" distribution.  (OK, so I'm picking nits here! B^)

Now, for some more nits, probably related to files permissions.  I cannot run
either ka9q or kermit as a user.  Both run fine under root.  I get EACCES errors
on the /dev/tty64 device.  Do I need to change the access from 644 to 666?

Also, the /usr/bin/users script won't run from a user either.  This time awk
complains about not being able to access a temp file.  This also runs fine from root.

And finally, I've been noticing some dropped characters on a terminal connected
to /dev/tty65 at 19200 baud.  the terminal will do either XON/XOFF flow control
or DTR flow control, but LINUX seems to want to do CTS/RTS?  I have no problems
with my modem on /dev/tty64 at 19200, but that could be due to the fact that it's
connected only at 2400 baud on the remote end (a 286 PC running KA9Q under DOS
acting as my SL/IP to ethernet packet router).  The terminal is a Televideo 970
(VT100 compatible).  I suppose I could run it at a slower speed, but ....

Now, someone wanna tell me what my options are in order to change my
hard disk boot to allow me to select which OS to run (with a default timeout)?
As long as my finances are tied up using QUICKEN under DOS, I cannot completly
convert to LINUX (unless we can run DOS as a LINUX process!, but that is another
argument altogether, for another time).

Thanx for all the help, and keep up the good work!

Something you didn't address - the home directory for root.  I respectfully
suggest it *not* be /usr/root, because /usr may well be a mountable file
system (it is in my case), which causes various startup problems.  Most
systems have the home directory for root be /.  I suggest we change it to
there, in spite of the problems with cluttering / (how much really gets put
into root's home directory anyway, other than .  startup files which don't
show up and clutter a directory listing?).

P.S. For the record I also suggested we add the /usr/man/catN directories

and I'd like to fix that.  With that, backups to floppys should be
automatic with proper options to tar, removing the need for disksplit or
anything else.  This would be much faster and simpler, and remove the need
for a special, non-Unix-standard command set to do backups.

Thanks for taking the initiative here!  I've missed the various utility

This is something I've noticed as well:  THE FDISK PROVIDED ON THE ROOT
DISTRIBUTION REPORTS WRONG DEVICE NAMES FOR MANY PARTITIONS.  It's
irritating, but I was able to figure out what was right after some
fooling around.  Basically, all partitions should fall in the hda[1-4]
or hdb[1-4] range.  (And remember, create the /dev/hdb[2-4] entries if
you need them.  Linus forgot them on the root disk again. :)

One way to check the contents of a partition is to cat the device.  Not
pretty, and sometime you'll enter graphic-character hell, but it can provide
clues as to which partition is really which.

Subject: Typical installation difficulties: v0.95

Hi Linuxers,

I seem to have a slight problem installing 0.95.  The boot/root
images come up perfectly. But I used rawrite to get those to floppy.
The problem comes when I have to get all that other wonderful stuff
from floppy to linux.  MSDOS won't do it since I can't mount a DOS
disk to a minix partition... So, I was just wondering how one would
go about getting all that tarred stuff placed onto mountable floppies
to shuttle to minix... :)

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
-Dave

While I hoped 0.95 would solve all major problems people had with linux,
I was wrong (surprise, surprise). I've had reports of three different
driver-related problems already, even on machines that ran 0.12. So I'm
running a little gallup to see how 0.95 works...

If you have tested out 0.95, I'd appreciate it if you'd reply to me by
mail (just a simple 'R' in most unix-newsreaders), and answer these
questions (even if you've had no problems).  Also, if there seems to be
any special circumstances that make the problems worse, I'd be
interested to hear about them. 

1) Unable to run 0.95 from a floppy-root: get "reset-floppy called", and
finally a "unable to mount root" panic.  (yes/no).

2) Harddisk gives "unexpected interrupt", and/or some of the data read
seem corrupted.  (yes/no)

3) Serial lines act weird/hang/etc when under heavy use.

4) Anything else that seems weird..

I think I've found the problem with (1) - it seems to be a missing
recalibration after read/write errors (add a "recalibrate = 1;" to
floppy.c: bad_flp_intr()), but the reason(s) for the others are still
shrouded in mystery. 

        Sorry for the inconvenience,

i got 0.95 working last nite without much headache. i simply took the root
device, mounted it and moved all the files onto my hard disk. then i put the
kernel sources in another place and remade it, fixing the makefile along the
way. it compiled and came up without problem.

several notes:

o  i'd like to be able to have a timeout waiting for the svga selection. in
   the old system i never bothered to hit return to change the screen
   resolution, so reboots were a single-step process. esp for machines which
   want to run without operator intervention (i.e. with shoelace), they'd like
   to automatically boot and come up with some default configuration.

o  thanks, linus, for plugging in the fixes for file modes, although i'd still
   argue that in open_namei() it shouldn't make the conclusion that
   O_TRUNC ==> O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC. it seems it was built that way to support
   the old mount command, which used only O_TRUNC in its open call.

o  i made the (slight) mods to my mmap and io bitmap patches for 0.95. the
   ega demo (which uses both) seems to compile and work fine. i will be posting
   them anew (with all the pieces) as soon as some other things get resolved.

o  bad news: i'm using the old gcc1.40 to compile stuff, and just like linus
   predicted, i needed to use -fcombine-regs to compile the kernel. no prob and
   the kernel seems to work ok. however, some of the x libraries now won't
   compile, running out of swap space. i created a larger (6mb) swap area and
   with 10mb of virtual mem i can't imagine running out of space, esp since
   under the old system all of x compiled in 8mb of virtual space. tracking
   it down it seems that the other processes' frames get evicted until the
   compile's allocation reaches the maximum (in my case 640 frames). then it
   goes to out of memory.

   i saw in the sources some support for detection of thrashing (misspelled
   trashing - a pun?:-) and was going to put in a test to see if the thrashing
   test was causing some sort of failure. unfortunately i had performace a
   make clean on my libs so had to wait forever...

o  while compiling my linux-compatibility library i caused the compiler to
   hang! this was a very small file which #included <math.h> then defined
   cbrt(double d) { return pow(d, 1.0 / 3.0); }. the system ran but this
   compile failed to stop. looking at the paging i saw that this process was
   consuming a new page every 2 sec or so. this worried me because i was
   running with the new io bitmap stuff, which adds entries into the task
   struct. i throw this out to see if anyone has a similar problem. once this
   gets resolved i'll feel more comfortable with the mmap and io bitmap mods
   and will post them.

o  mounting floppy filesystems no longer seems to work. when i mount, then
   access it the kernel complains that the floppy has been changed and boots
   the inode. oh well...

o  i understand that 0.95 was compiled and tested using gcc2.0, and i'm in the
   process of obtaining it, but it does bother me that the old compiler doesn't
   work - things haven't changed that much that i can imagine would break a
   compiler, esp if other old binaries seem to work fine.

have others had similar problems? sorry about being vague about some of these
things, it was late and i didn't have time to get more specifics. once i do
i'll post them.
