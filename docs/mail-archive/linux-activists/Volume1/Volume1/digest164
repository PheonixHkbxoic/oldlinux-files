If you read National Semiconductors (or any elses) databooks this is
correct.. BUT it does work without problem at least between to 8250
compatible UART's. But to use it you need to have 16550A (or
compatible) with buffers so that the computer won't be overrun. I
don't know if Linux 0.95a uses the buffers, but it shouldn't be
impossible to add if it isn't there already.

What happens on Linux if two processes both try to use the same device
at the same time?  E.g., two processes, each tar'ing from the same
floppy?  Does the driver take care of this?  Is it a problem?
Likewise, what about serial ports?

    Well, I'm trying to compile ps095 (on my roommate's computer).
We applied the patches that came in the ps095.tar.  That went
ok.  When we try to rebuild the kernel, gcc gets a fatal signal
and aborts.  The file it vomits on is fork.c and the signal
number keeps changing (increasing).  Can someone give us a 
clue?

I too have a DTK-PEM-2530  80386DX 25MHz with a 12.5MHz bus speed. Linux
works fine in Turbo mode.  The troubles I've been having with "HD Timeout"
are all caused by a very cheap IDE hard disk controller card. The system works
just fine with a newer, faster card. 

(In case you're curious, the HD Controller is talking to two Seagate 1144A
drives and occasionally the system will "miss" an interrupt and things 
go haywire.)

MOST Directory permissions : 
should be 

755 - read / write / execute owner, read / execute everyone else

/tmp and /usr/tmp should be 1777 - sticky, read / write / execute all.
Sticky keeps people from deleting files they don't own.

Executables should probably be 555, read / execute all, unless they 
are setuid.  Many people like to make mount / umount setuid to 
root so that "normal" people can run them.  The best thing to
do there is to make the permissions on mount / umount 

u+s 750 , owner root, group wheel, and put yourself in group wheel.


/dev  

terminals, etc should probably be rw all - ie 666, hard disks 600, 
floppies 666.

This depends if the mapping is done at the BIOS or hardware level.  My guess
would be at the BIOS level, since it doesn't work under Linux.

You can hack hd.c to perform appropriate translations before issuing

Where are they?

I'm having problems compiling stuff with gcc.  I started out with gcc-1.40,
stuck it in the right places and made the right links, but couldn't even
#include <stdio.h> in my programs.

I read that I needed the compiler sources to get the headers, so I ftp'd
'em, and gcc2.0 at the same time.  I installed the newer compiler, which
came with a stdio header, but now compiles fail when the program wants to
include other stuff, particularly <dirent.h>.  This file exists in gcc2.0's
private includes directory, but then dirent.h includes sys/dirent.h, which
I can't find anywhere, not even with the linux 0.95a sources.

Another program I was trying to build wanted to include termio.h, which
didn't exist, but termios.h did, so I changed the name, and it was happy I
think.

Is there a full set of standard include files somewhere, or at least a
list of names, so I know what I'm missing (and hopefully where to find them)?


P.S.  If you post a reply to this, would you please mail a copy directly
to me as well?  My news feed misses about 98% of the articles posted here.

This has to do with how shared libraries are currently implemented in 
Linux.  

The top 4MB of a process's address space is reserved for shared 
libraries.  Any references to this address space will result in the 
shared library being  demmand paged into this area, just like a 
normal executable.

When you link with a library under /usr/lib/shared, the addresses in that 
library point to areas in that top 4MB. The libraries here are 
"stubs" so to speak, and have no actual code.

The /lib/lib92.03.16 or whatever file (the version of the shared 
library is maintained in crt0.{s,o} is the actual code 
which gets page faulted in.

Both the actual binary, and shread library stubs must be present
for shared libraries to work.

address space as a normal executable is.

X windows is an interaction between "client" processes (ie
xterm, xbiff, etc) and a server.  X386 is the xserver for 386 unixes.

Also, you can do graphics if you have used obz's mmap(2) patches,
by mapping the frame buffer into user memory.  Bank switching, etc
can be done through writing to /dev/port.

hardly.  A VERY small portion of the device dependant code 
(/src/mit/server/ddx/x386/drivers from the stock X11R5 distribution) 
is written in assembler, and then only the bank switching code.

You can't compile it with -finline-functions, for some reason.  Or
at least it compiled when I took out that option.  In fact there are
quite a few files in the kernel for which I had to switch compiler
options.  Also, there's a lingering d_entry in swap.c that should
be removed, I think.

And I'm not even sure I did it all right, because ps doesn't work
for me-- it only displays the header line, and sometimes it complains
about /dev/kmem.

YES.  This is normal behavior with Mtools.  It tries every entry for 
A:  or whatever in the devices.c?  file (in the source), and when
it gets an error it tries the next one.  Set the devices up so
that the first entry for A: or whatever is the most commonly 
used one.

Those are WARNINGS.  Warnings mean "Hey, you may have done something stupid,
but syntactically, it's correct.  Just thought I'd let you know".  gcc 
includes the functionality of lint with its warnings.

As far as having parallel compilations, etc you probably shouldn't do it.
With one build, you may swap a little on a typical 4M system,
, but mostly you'll still be in
real memory.  With two, that won't be the case with limited 
amounts of ram.  The rule of thumb is that disk is 1000 times slower than
real memory.

No.  The die() routine prints out some information, but no

implement core dumps now that we have a debugger.

You want to fork() then exec() not just exec when running the

Every now and then, a few people have had problems with the bootable
images for SCSI.  I think 3 people have had an identical problem with
the .95a images.  The only "common" thing I've seen, and possible
difference from my system is that no one is using shoelace.

You might try the bootimage-0.12.seagate.3 Linux .12 bootimage,
and make a root file system with shoelace and the kernel on it.

As far as a debugging version of the kernel : I will upload 
a version compiled with debug flags to headrest.colorado.edu
RSN.

Tommy Thorn tthorn@daimi.aau.dk is currently working on this,
and in a post of his I saw today, it was promised "RSN"

It looks like Wierdness has struck with Linux .95 - the larger 
kernel (compared to .12) + larger SCSI patches (seagate + ultrastor)
move an area being stomped on to something noticeable.  If you used
every patch available with .12 together, you also noticed
this problem.

In some cases, Linux (the stock kernel) stomps on Kernel memory, 
and depending on who you are, something not noticeable / file_table[] / stack 
, etc.  gets corrupted.  In my case, it was file_table[] that 
was being stepped on, with SCSI drivers in place and "active",
or with the initialization routine replaced by a return to eliminate
any chance the SCSI drivers had for messing things up.

The distribution SCSI kernel, or the kludge.diff moved this and made 
it go away.  

Also, if you are booting off of floppy without shoelace, BSS will be
uninitialized, and is not guranteed to be all 0's.  This 
may or may not effect Linux.   I don't know what happens to BSS 
if you are using shoelace.
