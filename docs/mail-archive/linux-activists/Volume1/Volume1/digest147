(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX v0.95a
======================================
Compiled by Chuck Boyer with help from the persons on the
'alt.os.linux' newsgroup.
====================
Following are the 'copyright' for Linux, followed by the
guide itself. The 'Beginner's Guide' is in a 'draft' mode
and will be posted with updates about one weekly until
the target date of April 15, 1992 in which case I plan to
be done with its basic form.
==================== 
 
          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95
          Linus Torvalds, March 7, 1992
  
          COPYRIGHT
  
Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.
 
The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if 
it carries linux, it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, 
and they all contain the copyright). 
 
 
The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you
may freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts 
of it, as long as you make source available (not necessarily in the 
same distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for 
nothing more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you 
distribute will also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.
 
 
NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface
to linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you 
may use them as you wish, and using those in your binary files 
won't mean that your files are automatically under the GNU 
copyleft.  This concerns /only/ the unistd-library and those (few) 
other library functions I have written: most of the rest of the 
library has it's own copyrights (or is public domain).  See the 
library sources for details of those.

(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX/UNIX
================== 
          INSTALLATION
 
Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;
 
INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied
version 0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard 
disk, among other things. LINUX.FAQ is the linux 
'Frequently-Asked-Questions' documentation file. Grab a copy of 
these for future reference. Most of the material will be beyond 
your understanding for a little while, but once you have installed 
your Linux copy for yourself you should have gained an 
understanding through the process to understand much of what is 
included in these documentation files.
 
It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a
document, file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You 
use 'ftp' to call up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the 
mode of transfer, and 'get filename' to transfer the file from the 
logged onto system ftp site to your home directory of the machine 
you have called out from.
 
It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS
and can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create 
batch files using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line 
statement, and how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, 
erase, etc...). I am only trying to create a documentation here for 
DOS users who are totally unknowlegable of Unix system calls, 
utilities, commands and lastly; being a System Administrator (which 
you will be once you have Linux up and running on your 386/486 
machine).
 
In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc. 
that are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system 
user, so much of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in 
time and effort by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 
'alt.os.linux' newsfeed.
 
Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically,
you can run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drives 
only, or from your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around 
with Linux and get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating 
System (as opposed to a DOS operating system) then you might want 
to choose to just run it from the floppy drive. 
 
Basically, the logic here would be that, you don't want to screw up 
anything on your hard drive (which is loaded with Windows, word 
processors, graphics programs, data-base programs, etc.), and you 
have either spent long and hard learning hours to have it set up 
that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and you 
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux 
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive, 
basically. 
 
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access 
to that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' 
for instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then 
you wouldn't know how to do that yet...). Or, you could run Linux 
from booting from the floppy drive and thereafter having it run 
from the hard disk drive. The differences between these two methods 
are that Linux will run a lot (10 times?) slower if you choose to 
run it solely from the floppy disk drive, and you will be limited 
to the commands and utilities that you can run using the floppy 
drive only situation. 
 
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux 
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more 
programs and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having 
to learn to 1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, 
and 2) learning how to maintain this partition with a handfull of 
sub-directories.
 
===================
When you boot up Linux 0.95a with the two floppies, the second
(rootimage floppy) will put into Linux as the system admin-
istrator ('root', as well as '/'). You are presented with
a blank screen other than your line prompt ('#'). You are
sitting on a drive/directory which is the beginning directory.
You are root ('system administrator', or '/'). If you issue
a command 'ls(ENTER)' (that's; type 'ls' and hit ENTER), you
will be presented with a listing of the directories;
                                                    
# INSTALL         dev     mnt     usr
  bin             etc     tmp
 
 
====================
This is the '/root' ('/') directory on the Linux 0.95a
distribution file; 'rootimage.0.95a' at tsx-11.mit.edu 3/23/92.
 
(issue the command; 'ls -l' to get this type of listing;)
====================
 
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root          160 Mar 17 19:33 INSTALL
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root          432 Mar 17 18:14 bin
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         1232 Mar 17 19:18 dev
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root          272 Mar 22 08:45 etc
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root           32 Mar 17 17:06 mnt
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root           32 Mar 17 14:20 tmp
drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root           48 Mar 17 18:15 usr
====================
These are 'all' directories. You can mount another drive using
'mnt', 'tmp', or 'usr' directories. You can move into a dir-
ectory by issuing the command; 'cd directoryname'. Try, for
instance,; 'cd INSTALL'. Do an 'ls -l' or 'ls' and see what
files are there.
 
Read the files with the command; 'more filename' (where 'file-
name' is any filename that you choose, i.e.; 'install' or
'readme', etc.). If the file is large and keeps scrolling across
the terminal screen then use 'ctrl-s' to stop it and 'ctrl-q'
to resume printing to screen. (the 'more' utility sends the
output of 'filename' to stdout, which is an abbreviation for
'standard out', which is just the term used to describe what
the process is doing). (stdin/stdout are two terms you will
see often in discussions here in the 'linux' newsgroup at times.
They stand for 'standard in, or 'the standard/default place
for input to come from = keyboard', or 'standard out' 'the
standard/default place for output to be sent = screen/monitor/
terminal').
 
====================
These are the files in the '/bin' directory on the Linux 0.95a
distribution file; 'rootimage.0.95a' at tsx-11.mit.edu 3/23/92.
====================
This is a listing using the command; 'ls'
(This ends the examples of using the 'ls' (straight, without
any 'switches' selected in the command line for optional output
in different formats.)

total 9
====================
 
====================
'/mnt'
and
'/tmp'
are empty of any files as they are the 'mounting' points for
floppy drives, hard drives, and other file systems that you
wish to mount to.
 
====================
These are the files in the '/usr/bin' directory on the Linux 0.95a
distribution file; 'rootimage.0.95a' at tsx-11.mit.edu 3/23/92.
====================
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         29700 Mar  7 23:58 chmod
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         33796 Mar  7 23:58 chown
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         41988 Mar 17 18:07 more
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         33796 Mar  7 23:58 setterm
====================
 
An explanation of the above files' listing;
-rwxr-xr-x 
        are the 'permissions' settings for the files/directories.
1 root 
        is the owner of the file (root in this case.)
sys
        is the kind of file (a system file.)
29700
        is the size of the file in bytes.
Mar 7
        is the date the file was created (or last modified.)
23:58
        is the time the file was created (or last modified.)
chmod
        is the filename.
====================
EXPLANATIONS:
====================
Given the above example again of a directory listing of the
file 'chmod' in the directory '/usr/bin':
====================
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         29700 Mar  7 23:58 chmod
 
        The 'permissions' settings for the files/directories.
        'r' means 'read' permission (can read the file).
        'w' means 'write' permission (can write to the file, i.e.
                edit/change it.)
        'x' means 'execute' permission (can execute the file,
                if it is an executable/binary file.)
 
-rwxr-xr-x
0123456789
        There are nine place holders for settings in 'all' 
        cases of permission settings on all files.
        The '0' place is for the type; file, or directory.
        The '1' place is for 'read' for 'sysadm/root'.
        The '2' place is for 'write' for 'sysadm/root'.
        The '3' place is for 'execute' for 'sysadm/root'.
        The '4' place is for 'r' for 'group'.
        The '5' place is for 'w' for 'group'.
        The '6' place is for 'x' for 'group'.
        The '7' place is for 'r' for 'all/anybody'.
        The '8' place is for 'w' for 'all/anybody'.
        The '9' place is for 'x' for 'all/anybody'.
 
The idea here is that a file can be set for security reasons
to be readable by some, all, nobody, writeable by some, all, 
nobody, executable by ..... etc. It is for system security 
reasons that the system administrator has the ability to set
file attributes/permissions so that only she/he can run certain
system routines, as well as other things. Also, any other user
can open up a directory and its files (or only certain files)
for others to read, others to write to (group that they all
belong to, for instance), or others to execute. So everybody
gets to set/change file attributes in one fashion or another.
The command to change a file that has just been written for
instance so that you can read it afterwards for instance is;
 
'chmod u+r filename'
 
To have it read and write and execute;
 
'chmod u+rwx filename'
 
To have 'all' read and execute it;
 
'chmod a+rx filename'
 
The three designations for changing files attributes then are;
read, write, and execute permissions set to either on or off.
Also, there are three sectors affected by these permission
settings; user, group, all. ('u', 'g', 'a').
 
=====================
ERROR CODES and their MEANINGS
=====================
You can find these by looking in /usr/include/errno.h and in 
/usr/src/lib/estdio/errlist.h . However this will be a problem if
you can't get you system up and running. (by the way, most programs
report "EPERM" instead of "error 2", which just depends on how
one compiled the program. 
 
Here comes  /usr/src/lib/estdio/errlist.h:
 
/* EUNKNOWN          0 */ "Unknown error",
/* EPERM             1 */ "Not owner",

COMMANDS and their USAGE
=================
(I must admit that I too am a beginner, so I have not included
the explanation for all of the commands available in Linux.
You will have fun learning from other books, reading news
discussions on the net, etc. I have given examples of the 
utility programs that you will find most helpful and most
useful during your first stages of learning.)
 
In my examples I will give you a listing of the command to
type and what you will type will be enclosed in single
quote marks; 'type this'. Then always assume to hit the
ENTER key. Also, where command affects a file for you
to use then I will give a generic name to the file
for the examples' sake of 'filename' where you supply
the actual name of the file.
=================
bawk
        pattern matching language
 
cat
        concatenate files and write them to standard output
 
        This means that using 'cat' you can list the contents
        of a file to your screen.         
 
        'cat filename'
 
        (you can also use the 'more' command as the standard
        file 'browser' utility. 'less' is an enhanced 'more.')
 
        
cd
        change working directory
        
        'cd ..' moves you backup one directory in the directory
        tree. (branches, root).
 
        'cd /' moves you to the root/beginning.
 
        'cd /usr/bin' from anywhere that you are moves you to
        that subdirectory.
 
 
chmod
        change access modes for files, directories.
 
comm
        print lines common to two sorted files
 
compress
        compress a file
 
        'compress filename' creates; filename.Z
 
        'uncompress filename.Z' creates; filename
 
 
cp
        copy a file
 
        'cp filename /usr/bin/filename' copies the file
        to the /usr/bin directory.
 
cut
        cut out columns in a file
 
dd
        disk dumper
 
df
        report free disk space and i-nodes
 
        You can use just 'df' to see a report of how much free
        disk space you have.
 
du
        print disk usage
 
file
        guess at file's type by contents.
 
find
        find files meeting a given condition
 
grep
        search a file for lines containing a given pattern
 
        'grep anything filename' will find each occurance
        of 'anything' in the file 'filename.'
 
group
        group identity
 
head
        print the first few lines of a file.
 
        'head filename' prints the first 5 lines of the file.
 
issue
        system identification file
 
kill
        send a signal to a process
 
ln
        (link)
        link a file
        using 'link' you can save file space in bytes. You issue
        a command line command to make a link in this directory,
        to a file which resides in another directory. The file
        in the other directory stays there. A 'name-marker' in
        the inode table is given a number and a filename in the 
        current directory that you are in. The new 'name-marker
        filename' link runs the file in the linked from file/
        directory.
 
        So;
        'ln /usr/lib/gcc cc'
 
        would give you a link in this current directory called
        'cc' to an actual file in /usr/lib named 'gcc'.
 
        The benefit of this is that the link filename is only
        the length in bytes as the filename place marker is.
        That's usually about 18 bytes. If /usr/lib/gcc was 180 
        thousand bytes, then this would be a huge savings in 
        disk spaced used/saved. Thus the benefit of 'link' which 
        in Linux is 'ln'.
 
        As in the example, 'ln' can also be used to make a second
        name for a file that is actually pointing to the first
        filename. (In the root floppy image of Linux distribution
        in /usr/bin directory 'uncompress' is actually linked to
        'compress', in the same directory. They both 'call' the
        same program at run time.
 
ls
        list the contents of the directory. (Show all files)
        (list contents of directory tree with files to standard
        out), (standard out is another name for the terminal,
        or monitor screen). (standard out in computerese is 
        referred to as 'stdout', so one may find that title
        referred to in a description.)
 
        'ls(ENTER)'   gives;.....
 
        file1   file2   file3   file4   readme  file6
        file7   file8   file9   file10  file11  file12
        file13  file14
 
        output to stdout.
 
        'ls -l(ENTER)' gives;.....
 
        f.....rwxr--r--    01234    Mar2 10:00  file1
        f.....rwx------      443    Mar3  1:39  file2
        f.....rw-rw-rw-     8930    ----6:00    file3
        
        etc. (output on down listed vertically on the screen. 
        (Scrolls).
        
        'ls -lFR(ENTER)' gives.....
 
        /bin
                /docs
                        file1
                        file2
                        file3
                        file4
                        file6
                        file7
                        file8
                        file9
                        file10
                        file11
                        file12
                        file13
                        file14
                        readme
 
                                /bin/docs/old
                                                file1
                                                orchestrate.1
                                                moonbeams.txt
 
        etc.....
 
        You can fit the output of the directory listing command
        through the use of a director (greater-than symbol key)
        and put it into a file instead of to stdin/stdout 
        (keyboard, screen). 'ls > filenames'
        Would save the output of the 'ls' command to a file
        named 'filenames.' Then you can type the contents of
        'filenames' to screen (stdout).
make
        a program to run a 'Makefile' which is a script file
        to run a 'compile' process on a group of files to
        compile a program.
 
man
        display manual pages
 
mkdir
 
        make a directory.
 
        'mkdir dirname' creates a directory called 'dirname.'
 
mkfs
        make a file system
 
        You use this on a pre-formatted DOS disk to render
        it readable by the Linux Operating System. Or use
        it on a hard drive partition. You have to supply the
        size for mkfs to setup the drive/disk to. On floppies
        it's;
 
        'mkfs /dev/at0 1200' for 5 1/4" 1.2M disks -and-
 
        'mkfs /dev/at1 1400' for 3 1/2" 1.4M disks.
 
        For a hard drive partition you would first issues
        the command 'fdisk' to get a readout of the sizes
        on your partitions that fdisk reports. Then mkfs
        your partition size using that reported information.
 
        'mkfs /dev/hda2 20000' if it were the 2nd partition
        on your first/only hard drive and fdisk had reported
        the 20000 size.
        
mknod
        make a special file (/dev/***).
 
        
more
        pager
 
mount
        mount a file system
 
        You mount a file system so that you can access it.
        
        'mount /dev/at0 /mnt' would mount the disk in 
        the floppy drive to the filesystem name '/mnt'
        (which is provided for you on the distribution as
        an empty filesystem for this purpose.)
 
        'mount /dev/hda2 /usr' to set up second partition
        on first hard drive mounted to the '/usr' file
        system.
 
        
mtab
        mount table
 
mv
        move or rename a file
 
        'mv filename newfilename' would rename 'filename'
        to 'newfilename'.
 
patch
        patches up a file from the original and a diff
 
pr
        print a file
 
rm
        remove a file
 
        'rm filename' would erase the file.
 
rmdir
        remove a directory
 
        'rm dirname' would erase the directory only if it is
        first empty of any files. (You would have to remove
        all of the files first).
 
sh
        shell
 
        When you boot up Linux 0.95a you are in the shell.
        The shell in 0.95a is 'ash'. You can get 'bash'.
        Bash is larger but has more features.
 
 
stty
        set terminal parameters
 
sync
        flush the cache to disk
 
tail
        print the last few lines of a file
 
 
        'tail filename' would print to stdout/screen the last
        ten lines of 'filename'.
 
tar
        tape archiver/files w/sub-directories attached into
        a compressed 'tar' file.
 
        'tar cvf tarnamefile dirname' would compress and
        keep in order all directories and files in the
        directories into the tar file 'tarnamefile' from
        the directory name you supplied 'dirname'.
 
        ('tar xvf tarname.tar' would uncompress it back
        to its original form.)
tty
        print the device name of this tty
 
umount
        unmount a mounted file system
 
        'umount /dev/at0' unmounts the filesystem and
        drive a: (remember the name does 'not' include
        an 'n' in it. It's not 'unmount' but 'umount').
 
utmp
        user accounting data
