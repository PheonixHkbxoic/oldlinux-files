Hi Linuxers!
Back (again), I've corrected some bugs (minor/major nums). Added
information on boot-floppy and a few other things

======


The originall FAQ 1st version was posted in Dec. 19, by Robert Blum,

Most credits of this work to Linus, Robert and Ted, the rest was
either on the list posted by many (real) activists, not me ;-), either
in some other news groups, or else by direct posting to me (thanks
Humberto, Dan, Michael, Drew). I haven't systematically copyrighted
them, so thanks to every one who participated even indirectly to this
FAQ. 

[The last-change-date of this posting is always "two minutes ago".  :-)]

This is the introduction to a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ
for short) about Linux with answers (Yeap!).  This article contains a
listing of the sections, followed by the question/answer part.

This FAQ is supposed to reduce the noise level ;-) in the alt.os.linux
newsgroup (and also the 'linux-activists' mailing list), and spare the
time of many activists. I will post it twice a month, since there are
more and more new incomers, and new features.

BTW I think this FAQ should be available at the main Linux sites in
the doc directory (have you read this Ari, Robert, Ted/Michael ?). So
I will send a copy to the main sites.

Please suggest any change, rephrasing, deletions, new questions,
answers ...  
Please include "FAQ" in the subject of messages sent to me about FAQ.  
Please use corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr whatever will be the From part 
of this message.


Thanks in advance,
                                Marc <corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr>

Future Plan:
        - verification/location/organization for files available 
        via FTP (I've tried what a mess!!)
        - cross posting this to news.answers as soon as comp.os.linux 
        is created.
        - reorganization of the FAQ. I don't know how, but I feel it's
        needed, any help appreciated.

I. LINUX GENERAL INFORMATION 
=============================

QUESTION: What is linux?

ANSWER: Linux is a small unix for 386-AT computers, that has the added
advantage of being free. It is still in beta-testing, but is slowly
getting useful even for somewhat real developement.  The current
version is 0.95a, date: March 17th 1992. The previous version v0.95
(March 7th) had some bugs, please do not use it anymore.


   Linux 0.95(a) is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the
libraries.  For this reason it can be made available with the complete
source code via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus
machines; porting to non-Intel architectures is likely to be
difficult, as the kernel makes extensive use of 386 memory management
and task primitives.


QUESTION: What is the current state of Linux?

ANSWER: do "finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", or read the
alt.os.linux newsgroup.


QUESTION: I've just heard about linux, what should I do to get it?

ANSWER: First read all this FAQ, and the INFO-SHEET monthly post, then
go to the nearest ftp site (see below), download the Images there are
two a rootimage and a bootimage (in general in the images directory),
download the INSTALL and RELNOTES files.  Find the rawrite utility
(for example at tsx-11 it's in /pub/linux/INSTALL), then rawrite the
images on HIGH density floppies (5.25 or 3.5), finally boot on the
root diskette and that's it.
BTW From another Unix system a "dd" works fine.

After playing a while, you should want to install linux on HD (there
are scripts on the v0.95a images for that purpose), see also section
III for INSTALLATION. Then you will need
a compiler (gcc) and utilities, all can be found at the different
places described in section II below.


QUESTION: Does it run on my computer?

ANSWER: Linux has been written on a clone-386, with IDE drives and a
VGA screen. It should work on most similar setups. The harddisk should
be AT-standard, and the system must be ISA.  A high density floppy
drive -- either 5".25 or 3".5

IDE and MFM seem to work with no problem. It works, also, for some
ESDI drive (Joincom controller with Magtron drive after you have
commented out the "unexpected hd interrupt"-message from hd.c). There
exists a high-level SCSI driver, under which low-level drivers are
placed; a ST-01/ST-02 low driver has been completed

Otherwise the requirements seem relatively small: a 386 (SX, DX or any
486).  Any video card of the following: Hercules, CGA, EGA, (S)VGA.

It needs at least 2M to run, and 4M is definitely a plus. It can
happily use up to 16M (and more if you change some things). 


QUESTION: Why the suggested 4Meg, for Linux?

ANSWER: Linux uses the first 640k for kernel text, kernel data and
buffercache. Your mother board may eat up 384K because of the chipset.
Moreover there is: init/login, a shell, update possibly other daemons.
Then, while compiling there is make and gcc (1.39 ~400k; 2.00 ~700k).
So you don't have enough real memory and have to page.


QUESTION: How would this operate in an OS/2 environment?

ANSWER: Fine.


QUESTION: Will linux run on a PC or 286-AT? If not, why?

ANSWER: Linux uses the 386 chip protected mode functions extensively,
and is a true 32-bit operating system. Thus x86 chips, x<3, will
simply not run it.


QUESTION: Will Linux run on a 386 Laptop?

ANSWER: It works for some at least.


QUESTION: How big is the 'complete' Linux package?

ANSWER: Well, the boot and root image diskettes are about 750k
compressed.  The kernel sources are about 200k compressed, and the
libc sources are another 170k compressed.  The GNU C compiler is 670k,
and the other miscellaneous unix utilities are probably a bit over a
megabyte.

Now add sources to whatever you want to port and compile yourself.
The sources to GNU emacs are about 3 megabytes, compressed.  Groff (a
troff replacement) is just over 1 megabyte.

If you think this is big, remember that the OS/2 2.0 Limited
Availability release is 20 1.44 megabyte diskettes.


QUESTION: (Dan) How long has Linux been publicly available?

ANSWER (partial): Few months, v0.10 went out in Nov. 91, v0.11 in Dec.
and the current version 0.95a is available since March 17th 92. But even
it is pretty recent it is quite reliable. There are very few and small
bugs and in its current state it is mostly useful for people who are
willing to port code and write new code.
As Linux is very close to a reliable/stable system, Linus decides that
v0.13 will be known as v0.95

QUESTION: What's about the copyright of linux.

ANSWER: This is an except of the RELEASE Notes v.095a: Linux-0.95a is
NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by Linus Torvalds. The
copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it
carries linux, it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and
they all contain the copyright).


QUESTION: Should I be a UNIX and/or a DOS wizard to install/use Linux?

ANSWER: Not at all, just follow the install rules, of course it will be
easier for you if you know things about Unix. Right now Linux is used
by more than 400 persons, very few of them enhance the kernel, some
adds/ports new soft, most of us are only (but USEFUL) beta testers.
Last but not least, various Linuxers work on manpages, newuser_help,
file-system organization. So join us and choose your "caste"


QUESTION: What are the differences, pros and cons compared to Minix ?

ANSWER (partial): 
Cons: 
- Linux is not as mature as Minix, there is less working software right now.  
- Linux only works on 386 and 486 processors.  
- Linux needs 2M of memory just to run, 4M to be useful.  
- Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message passing.

Pros: 
- Linux is free, and freely distributable, BUT copyrighted.  
- Linux has some advanced features such as:
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Multi-threaded file system
  - job control and virtual memory, virtual consoles and pseudo-ttys.
- Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message
passing.


QUESTION: Does Linux use TSS segments to provide multitasking?

ANSWER: Yes!


QUESTION: If my PC runs under Linux, is it possible to ftp, rlogin,
rsh etc.. to other Unix boxes?

ANSWER: Not yet, but kermit has been ported to Linux, and the ka9q too.


QUESTION: Does linux do paging? Can I have virtual memory on my small
machine?

ANSWER: Linux0.95(a) does do paging in a better way than Linux0.12.


QUESTION: Can I have tasks spanning the full 4GB of addressable 386
memory? No more 64kB limits like in coherent or standard minix?

ANSWER: Linux does limit the task-size, but at a much more reasonable
64MB (MEGA-byte, not kilos), so bigger programs are no problem.


QUESTION: Does the bigger program sizes mean I can run X?

ANSWER: X is not (yet) ported to linux, and I hope it will be some day,
people are working hard on it but it's big, and wants a lot from
the system.


II. LINUX USEFUL ADRESSES 
=========================

QUESTION: Where can I get linux?

ANSWER: Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from
        nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100):
                directory /pub/OS/Linux
        Tupac-Amaru.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE (137.226.112.31):
                directory /pub/msdos/replace
        tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
                directory /pub/linux
        ftp.eecs.umich.edu (141.212.99.7):
                directory linux
        src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7):
                directory /pub/os/Linux
        hpb.mcc.ac.uk (130.88.200.7):
                directory pub/linux
        ustsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11):
                directory misc/linux
        banjo.concert.net (192.101.21.6):
                directory pub/Linux/mirrors

You might want to check out which of these is the most up-to-date.

If you don't have ftp-capability, you are in trouble. See next Q/A.  If
you have no uncompress utility, there are a lot even for DOS, have a
look on SIMTEL, or else use facilities provided by some sites to
uncompress for you. Don't do that if you can, because it's lengthy,
expensive and causes troubles to other users on ftp sites.


QUESTION: I do not have FTP access, what can I do to get linux?

ANSWER: Try to contact a friend on the net with those access, or try
mailserver/ftpmail server otherwise contact tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU. You
might try mailing "mailserver@nic.funet.fi" with "help" in the body of
the mail.  If you choose ftpmail server (example: ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com),
with "help" in the body, the server will send back instructions and
command list. As an exemple to get the list of files available at tsx-11
in /pub/linux send:

                mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
                subject: anything
                reply <your e-mail>
                connect tsx-11.mit.edu
                chdir /pub/linux
                dir -R
                quit

QUESTION: Is there a newsgroup or mailing-list about linux? Where can
I get my questions answered? How about bug-reports?

ANSWER: alt.os.linux is formed, and comp.os.linux is on the way, for
those who can't access to the news you can ask for digest to:
Linux-Activists-request@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU. On the other hand, mail
sent to Linux-Activists@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU are posted to
alt.os.linux

DO NOT mail "I want to [un]subscribe" to the newsgroup, use
the request-address. IF not your mail-box will be over-crowded by
activists.

Questions and bug-reports can be sent either to the newsgroup or to
"torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", depending on which you find more
appropriate. Moreover there is a BUGLIST file available in the
different main site (at least you can find it at tsx-11, in
pub/linux/patches/BUGLIST). 

BTW People are working on the organization of Linux, this is done on
a separate mailing-list.

linux-standards: Discussion of distribution and directory standards
for the Linux operating system, including directory structure, file
location, and release disk format.

Requests to be added to this list must be sent to:
              linux-standards-request@banjo.concert.net

QUESTION: Does there exist a place where the traffic of the newsgroup
is kept?

ANSWER: Yes, on nic and tsx-11 (see the ftp adresses above), and since
12th March, a Gopher server is up at beryl.daimi.aau.dk
(130.225.16.86). The archives go back to Nov. 18. 91

III. INSTALLATION and SECURITY 
==============================


QUESTION: I have copyed all the rootimage stuff on my HD, how can I
use the hard-disk as root?

ANSWER: There are two ways to answer this:
a) You have download the linux sources and a compiler, in that case
recompile the kernel to make a new boot-floppy according to your
environment. Just have a look in the main Makefile and in
kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S (notice .S not .s) to set your national
keyboard. 
b) You have nothing except the images and DOS, in that case you should
have read the INSTALLATION notices provided at your ftp site, but well:
You have to change the boot image at offset 508. The word (in
386-order, i.e low-byte first) tells the system which device to use as
root: initially it's 0 which means that we want to use a floppy of the
same type as the boot-disk (this is the reason why HIGH density
floppy is required for the boot-image).
In order to use the HD as root, this value has to be changed to point
to the correct device. For that purpose you can download the program
enclosed in INSTALL-0.10 (provided some slight modification according
to the new minor/major numbers) use the program written by Henning
Spruth wich can be found in digest#149 vol1 (there are both the C code
and the uuencoded DOS executable) or else any sector editor.

QUESTION: How can I be sure I won't be writing over anything
important?  I have to use DOS on my machine, and I don't want to
lose any files.

ANSWER: Back up everything. Just in case. Then, write some easily
recognizable pattern to the partition you have reserved for linux,
using some DOS tool. You can then use "cat /dev/hdX" under linux to
examine which of the partitions you used.


QUESTION: Linux mkfs doesn't accept the size I give the device,
although I double-checked with fdisk, and it's correct.

ANSWER: Be sure you give the size in BLOCKS, ie 1024 bytes, not
sectors. The mkfs doesn't work for very big partition (over than 64
Megs). Also, make doubly certain that you have the correct partition.

There are a few rules about this: /dev/hda (under linux0.95a) corresponds
to /dev/hd0 (under minix) and /dev/hdb (linux0.95a) to /dev/hd5
(minix).  DO NOT USE THEM, they are the whole raw
disk, not partitions. Also if a partition is on drive 1 under minix
(ie /dev/hd1-4), it is drive 1 under linux as well.  Moreover, there
is no real consensus on whether partition #1 is the first partition on
the disk, or is the first entry in the partition table.  Some parition
programs sort this information on the screen only, some will write the
sorted information back to the hard disk.  Linux assumes that the
first entry is hda1, and so if some utility starts sorting/reordering
the table these things can change.  Moreover, use very carefully extended
partition they are still in beta-test (this is in the installation notes). 

REMARK Minix does some reordering.

A useful hack is to make each of your partitions a different size.
Then after any editting or possible change to the partition table you
can boot a floppy system and run fdisk (linux's, not DOS) to see if
the assignments still hold.


QUESTION: I have a one partitionned 40Mb disk. If I run mkfs, what
happens?

ANSWER: If you do that, you will have an empty 40Mb Linux file system.
You should, at least, make on your hard disk, one partition per
operating system you want to use. 


QUESTION: I mounted the linux filesystem, and copied the files from
the root-disk to the harddisk. Now I cannot find them any more, and
somethimes linux dies with a "panic: trying to free unused inode".

ANSWER: You have probably forgot to sync before rebooting. Linux, like
all unices, use a "buffer cache" to speed up reads and writes to disk.
On a machine that has enough memory, this buffer-cache is 1.5MB, and
if you forget to sync before exiting, it may not be fully written out
to disk. Re-mkfs and re-install (or try to use the preliminary fsck,
but remember that although fsck tries to correct the faults it finds,
it may fail.)


IV. LINUX and DOS 
=================

QUESTION: Is it possible to access to DOS world from Linux

ANSWER: Yes, there is the mtools package (with patches for devices.c)
The original sources of mtools can be found at any places not only at
nic, tupac and tsx-11, and the patches for Linux (with fix for big DOS
partitions are in the directory patches or ports). Moreover you should
download the file patch.Z to apply patches :)
It is possible to find the compiled mtools stuff at mcc (see above for
the adress)


QUESTION: the mtools package won't work. I get an ENOENT error message
for all devices.

ANSWER: mtools needs to be told which device to look for. Use 'ln' or
'mknod' to create a special file called "/dev/dosX", where X is A, B,
C, X or Y. A and B are for floppies (12 bits), C is for hard disk and
X, Y for any. This file should point to the device you want to read.
About the minor/major pair have a look in section INSTALLATION HINTS.


QUESTION: What is as86.tar.Z ?

ANSWER: It's the port of Bruce Evans' minix assembler, you need it to 
be able to recompile Linux at your convenience. In fact this is only
used for boot/setup.s and boot/bootsect.s
BTW as86 should not work on keyboard.S, instead, you must use gcc -E
and then (g)as.


QUESTION: Turbo (Microsoft) Assembler won't compile the Linux boot
code.  In fact, some of the opcodes in these files look completely
unfamiliar.  Why?

ANSWER: The Linux boot codes are written in Bruce Evans' minix
assembler, which has the same opcodes as the original minix assembler
ported to linux get as86.tar.Z Anyway there are a few differences
between these and normal DOS assemblers:

 - No segments - everything is in the same segment (at least in the
   bootsectors and setup, as they don't use the .data segments)

 - mov[b|w|l] are shorter versions of mov ax,[byte|word|long] ptr
[XXX].
   This is how unix assemblers normally give the size (byte, word or
long).
   Gas has similar constructs.

 - There is no "jmp short", the opcodes are "j" for a short jump and
   "jmp" for a long one.

 - "jmpi" is a jump with a segment:offset pair. I don't know how this
is
   written in DOS assembly.


V. SOME CLASSICAL PROBLEMS 
==========================

QUESTION: While running du I get "Kernel panic: free_inode: bit
already cleared".  Also, du produces a ENOENT error for all the files
in certain of my directories.  What's going on?

ANSWER: These are both consistent with a bad file-system.  That's
relatively easy to produce by not syncing before rebooting, as linux
usually has 1.5MB of buffer space held in memory (unless you have <=4M
RAM, in which case the buffers are only about 0.5MB). Also linux
doesn't do anything special about the bit-map blocks, and as they are
used often, those are the thing most likely to be in memory. If you
reboot, and they haven't been written to disk ...

Just do an fsck on the device, the -a flag might repair it otherwise,
the only thing to do is to reinstall the filesystem from the Images.

A sync is done only every 30 seconds normally (standard unix
practice), so do one by hand (some people think you should do 3 syncs
after each other, but that's superstition), or by logging out from the
startup-shell, which automatically syncs the system. Unmounting a
filesystem also syncs it (but of course you can never unmount root).

Another (sad) possibility is that you have bad blocks on your disk.
Not very probable, as they would have to be in the inode-tables, just
a couple of blocks in size. Again there aren't programs available to
read a disk for bad sectors and put them in some kind of
"bad-sector-file".  On IDE drives this is no problem (bad sectors are
automatically mapped away).


QUESTION: How can I partition my hard-drive to use Linux?

ANSWER: There are (at least) two ways to answer this. The easy way is
probably to use a program which will do it for you, such as the MS-DOS
fdisk, Minix fdisk, Xenix/Unix fdisk, or programs such as edpart.exe 
or part.exe.

On the other hand, you can use a disk editor and modify the contents
of the partition table directly. This has been already done, and an
extensive explanatory note can be found in the mailing-list archives 
(25th Jan. 92). You must also edit the bpb on the Dos partition you
are shrinking, otherwise Dos will step on Linux.

BTW It might be useful to set three (3) separated partitions for
Linux, one for the root, another one for the usr and a third one for
swap, as an illustration, my root partition is 10Meg, the usr is 22Meg
and the swap partition is 8Meg (twice the size of RAM on my box). As 
an experience I have used MS-DOS fdisk to partition my two hd and got 
no peculiar difficulties.
You can, as long as you stay within the 64MB per filesystem
limit, have swap, root, etc, ... all on there.

QUESTION: What must I do to mkfs a floppy?

ANSWER: blocks are of size 1K so 1.44 floppy is 1440 blocks. The
floppy has to be formatted before this will work.


QUESTION: When I run kermit under Linux, I get "Warning, Read access
to lock directory denied". What am I doing wrong?

ANSWER: Nothing, you just need to create /usr/spool/uucp, which is
where kermit like to lock files.


QUESTION: du seems buggy when i used it the number of disk occupation
is wrong.

ANSWER: Take care, if you want size in kbytes use the -k flags.


QUESTION: du works just fine on directories, except on / and /dev,
moreover "ls -l" returns either big or negative number on /dev. Why?

ANSWER: This is a "feature" added in Linux 0.12; it was originally
present in Minix; more specifically, when you stat a device file
belong to a block device, it will return the maximum size of the block
device in the st_size member of the stat structure. If you don't like
it, it's very simple to patch it out. Look in the fs/inode.c, in the
subroutine read_inode().


QUESTION: When I try to (un)compress many files in one command, the
command partially fails?

ANSWER: This is a bug, many partial fixes are floating around but ..
You can solve it by a bash command "for i in whateverfiles;do 
compress $i; done". Another possibility is to download the
compress-fixed.tar file.


QUESTION: I can do this as root but not as non-root, is it a bug?

ANSWER: Except for the make utility, the problem is caused by an
incorrect permission flag. The most common problems are about /tmp
which should be 777 and /dev/ttys? which might be 766. So as root do

        chmod 777 /tmp ; chmod 766 /dev/ttys?


QUESTION Sometimes, I get "mount can't open lock file"; what does this
means? 

ANSWER: This can happened for two reasons: 
A) You try to mount something as non-root. In that case you can either
retry as root, or set the setuid bit to mount.
B) You are root. mount wants to open /etc/mtab and /etc/mtab~ - the
first one for reading, the second as lock file. If there is already a
mtab~ remove it. This can happen if you used once gnuemacs on mtab.

   Dunno, sounds like a bug unless you have "x" access, in which case being
   able to cd but unable to ls is the correct behavior.


right.  this would be a bug if they don't have search access to the
directory.  cd should be a shell internal function which just calls
the system routine chdir.

here is the pertinent manual entry from sunos, which i assume is close
to the standard.

CHDIR(2V)                 SYSTEM CALLS                  CHDIR(2V)

NAME
     chdir - change current working directory

SYNOPSIS
     int chdir(path)
     char *path;

     int fchdir(fd)
     int fd;

DESCRIPTION
     chdir() and fchdir() make the directory specified by path or
     fd  the current working directory.  Subsequent references to
     pathnames not starting with `/'  are  relative  to  the  new
     current working directory.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory,  a
     process must have execute (search) access to the directory.

RETURN VALUES
     chdir() returns:

     0    on success.

     -1   on failure and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     EACCES              Search permission is denied for  a  com-
                         ponent of the pathname.

     ENAMETOOLONG        The length of the path argument  exceeds
                         {PATH_MAX}.

                         A  pathname  component  is  longer  than
                         {NAME_MAX} while {_POSIX_NO_TRUNC} is in
                         effect (see pathconf(2V)).

     ENOENT              The named directory does not exist.

     ENOTDIR             A component of the  pathname  is  not  a
                         directory.

SYSTEM V ERRORS
     In addition to the above, the following may also occur:

     ENOENT              path points to an empty string.

WARNINGS
     fchdir() is provided as a  performance  enhancement  and  is
     guaranteed to fail under certain conditions.  In particular,
     if auditing is active the call will never succeed, and  EIN-
     VAL  will  be  returned.  Applications which use this system

CHDIR(2V)                 SYSTEM CALLS                  CHDIR(2V)

     call must be coded to detect  this  failure  and  switch  to
     using chdir() from that point on.
