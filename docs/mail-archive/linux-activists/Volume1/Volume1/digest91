A hint: somebody just posted a syslog package for system V in alt.sources.
Looks like it will run on Linux without too much trouble. Perhaps
someone with better net access can prepare an official package for Linux
from it ?

Yes, I've managed to do this, in fact it was the first hack I applied
to the source code. On my machine (which is based on the NEAT chip
set) you can map RAM into various parts of memory between the 640k &
1M boundaries. I used the memory from 0xd0000 to 0xeffff (128K). The
change to the kernel is in the function buffer_init in buffers.c , and
its quite simple to see how to change the code to include the extra
memory when allocating buffers for the cache. (Sorry I don't have a
patch right now, but mail me if you have problems).

Cheers,
        Simon.

I had the same problem, until Linus sent me the following:

It worked for me!  (I had editted mtab with EMACS at one time, oops!)

Subject: Nethack - another easy port.
From: hamilton@peponi.wcc.govt.nz (Michael Hamilton)

I recently ported nethack to Linux. I wanted to provide an incentive
for someone other than myself to login and make an entry in /etc/wtmp :-)

Nethack runs fine on my console, and also on a vt320 connected to
/dev/tty64 (or 65).  I had to change the vt320 entry in inittab to
vt100 (the original /etc/termcap 320/220 entries look OK but don't
seem to do the trick - complains about the terminal not being able
to do things?).

I'm using 0.12 with the abc release, and have applied almost all the
patches/enhancements around (nonblobking, curses, poe-IGL, ...). I
built nethack 3 patch level 6 (I think pl10 has a workaround for
systems that have bad scanf's).  I set the make files for System V.

In doing this I encountered only minor problems.

The following (f/s)scanf statement (in topten.c):

        if(fscanf(rfile, "%6s %d %d %d %d %d %ld %c%c %[^,],%[^\n]",

I had problems with both the %[] specs, the results are unpredictable.
Has this been fixed in 0.95 and GCC 1.4?  I eventually gave up on
scanf and wrote a simple parser using the str*() routines In a handful
of places Linux prototypes differed from ones declared in the game.

There are a few unresolved problems.  There seems to be a minor
problem with rip.c, it doesn't print the proper details (maybe a
curses problem).  Also curses sometimes gets the updates wrong, eg
zap, throw, on both the console and attached terminals.

In case anyone wants them, here are my diffs (I can make the binaries
available if anyones interested):

Hi,

I just put pfdisk.tar.Z on tsx-11 and funet.fi.
It contains the source for a partition editor for Linux. It is a 
modification (done by Saul Lubkin) of the bootmenu program posted 
in comp.sources.misc (Vol15). I did only a few minor changes. I got 
quite a number of requests for it, so it seemed better to upload it. 

Besides partitioning HDs you can also use it to boot any partition of 
the 1st HD (although you still need shoelace to make the Linux partition 
bootable).

Where is the kernel stored?  On SunOS, I find it under / (as /vmunix) and
as far as I understand, the same applies to most Unices (although the name
varies, e.g. unix, xenix, hp-ux).

There is a Bourne-shell clone in the latest 4.3BSD sources on uunet.
I think this would be the best choice.

Does any way exist to make partitions on the second physical HD bootable?

Thanks,
Adam
