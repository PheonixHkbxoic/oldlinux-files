Hi everybody,
Thanks for the great job! 

Now a problem, trying to cat an executable file messes up with the
display foever. Things are happening right but somehow the characters
get mixed up. Something wrong with me (my system) or elsewhere.

No.  The real reason for mvdir is the rename() does not exist.  I am volunteering
to write it.  This also appears to be the reason why mv's of sym links do not
work properly.

I've been doing a lot of reading & mock-coding for it, but I haven't
gotten to the testing stage yet.  (Primarily because I'm waiting to
get at our 386 to put Linux on it & get at the 32 bits; I'm presently

Subject: Linux 0.12 and Segmentation Faults 
Date: Mon, 20 Jan 1992 14:34:49 GMT

A couple of weeks ago I installed linux 0.11 on my machine (386-33 12M RAM) and
set it up to use /dev/hd1 as the root volume.  Whenever I was using linux 0.11
I would receive intermittent segmentation faults (seemingly at random) but
overall I was able to do a fair amount with it.  This weekend I decided to
install 0.12 and give it a try, hoping that the segmentation fault problem
would have vanished.  Well, not only did it not vanish, it has enlarged to
the point where linux 0.12 is practically unusable - most major commands now
fail with segmentation faults compounded by the root process dying after a
couple of faults are received.  The only thing I have been able to determine
so far is that the problem may be related to the memory in use by disk buffers
(ex. tar tvf man.tar or fdisk usually works, where as tar tvf utils.tar or mkfs
usually fails).  I've essentially given up on the idea of using 0.12 for 
anything useful until I can determine the source of these segment faults.  Has
anyone else out there run into this problem ?  If so, have you determined
the source ?  I would appreciate any ideas/suggestions that anyone has on
resolving this problem.

By the way is /bin/sh in fact bash? Is there a man page for it?

Subject: I can't boot from HD!
Date: 21 Jan 92 00:20:11 GMT


I have a generic 486-33 with 4mb and a 120mb ide drive.  I can boot linux
0.12 from floppy, and use the root floppy disk.  

I've made a ~40mb partition to use for linux.

#fdisk
/dev/hd3: 86079 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hd4: 41072 blocks unknown partition type 0x9F
# mount /dev/hd4 /user
/dev/hd4 mounted
#

..so that works OK.  I copied all the root files to the /user partition.

Now I'm ready to edit the bootimage and be able to use the root filesystem
on the hd.  Following the directions in the various INSTALL documents,
I believe that I should change the word at offset 508 to be 0x0304.

My binary editor uses hex offsets, so 508 = 0x1FC.  I therefore need to
change byte 1FC from 00 -> 04 and byte 1FD from 55 to 03.  I did this.

However, after the Loading.... message, and the VGA selection prompt,
nothing happens.  The computer locks, and C-A-D does nothing.

Can someone point out the stupid error I'm probably making?  thanks!

Hello,

        Glad there is finally a group for Linux!  I've been using Linux for
a couple of weeks now, and am very impressed.  I do have two questions
though:

1) Is it possible to boot directly from the hard disk?  Currently I have
   a hard drive partition for Linux, as well as Coherent and DR DOS, as
   the root partition, but I still must boot from floppy.

2) What is the directory structure for GNU C?  I have tryed various locations
   without any luck, gcc cannot find cpp, cc1, etc, I was able to get the
   compiler to work only by setting links to the gcc-* files, such as
   ln gcc-cc1 cc1.  If anyone is using this successfully could you please
   E-Mail me your setup?

Any and all replies welcome, thanks!

When I was helping to install linux (v.12) we could make a big (read
>32M) partition on the hard drive.  But, when we typed 
   mkfs -c /dev/hd1 81974  (or just about any size greater than 32K blocks)
mkfs choked.  Is there any reason for this?  I've seen references to other
people using bigger than 32M partitions.  Our solution was a kluge, we
partitioned the 124 meg hd into 32,32,32,28, making them all dos partitions,
and used the 1st one for dos, and the other 3 for linux.  (BTW is there a
better version of edpart or pdisk out there that won't choke on partitions
over 32M  (not dos 5 fdisk, we need to create two regular dos partitions, not
one regular and one extended.)?

Any help would be appreciated.

Hey, everyone!  First I would like to express my sincerest gratitude
to whoever wrote Linux.  Jolly good job!

Second, we figured out our partitioning problem.  It turns out that
the edpart program (dated 1990) worked, but in a bit of a cryptic 
manner.  If you use dos 5 fdisk to make your primary dos partition
as big as you want, then use edpart to make your other partitions
and set their status as UNACCESSIBLE, Linux would recognize them
just fine.  We still couldn't find a way to make Linux use 
anything bigger than a 32M partition, but oh, well.

Third, is there any possibility of a 286 version of Linux coming
out, or how hard would it be with the sources, to modify it to
run on a 286?  (I have a 286 and can't afford to upgrade right
 now)

Well, is anyone eager for /proc?  If we have it from the start, then we can
learn to love it, and eventually perhaps even cherish it...

Like so many things, I would do it, but I don't exactly have a HD right now,

and I'll do something /procish, if someone hasn't already.

I'm running linux on a fairly small 386sx machine, with a 1.2MB floppy
drive.  Everything works OK except that I can't do backups with tar.
I get one of two failure modes.  (1) system goes into an infinite loop
printing "Reset-floppy called".  (2) The system hangs, with the floppy
drive light on.  In the first case, it appears that something has
caused a recal (I suspect an error of some sort -- I haven't been able
to duplicate it since putting in extra prints), and the recal fails,
thus triggering a reset, which of course triggers a recal, which also
fails...  (I got to see the error message by causing a recal to always
appear to succeed.  This broke the looping, letting me see what was on
the console.) I don't know what is happening in the first case, as I
find it a bit harder to figure out what sort of debugging code to put
in.

I'm reluctant to do any further work on the system when I can't
back it up, and I don't have the PC expertise to fix it myself.

change 1fb to 04 and 1fc to 03.  1fd should remain 55 and 1fe should be aa.
