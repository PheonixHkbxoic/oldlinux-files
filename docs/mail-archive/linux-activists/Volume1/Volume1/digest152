Hi gang!

There will not be C-diff posted for the current FAQ, the FAQ next
release will be out in a short while. 
I'd posted it to nic, tupac (for this it's future) and tsx-11

Hi Linuxers,

again some questions/remarks:


1.
MTOOLS:
I made in devices.c several entries for A and B (to read 360/720/1.2 in 1.2M
and 720/1.44 in 1.44MB drive).
A 1.2MB disk in a 1.2MD drive and 1.44 in 1.44 work very fast and without
any error messages.
Reading a 720k in an 1.44MB drive gives:

Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
floppy I/O error
dev 021c, block 9
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
floppy I/O error
dev 021c, block 9
Reset floppy called

After that the normal mtools header (anyway I don't like that header,
to much information for a simple copy, but he tells me that 9 sectors
and all the other things are correctly recognized) appears and
the data (ie dir or copy) are correct.
Similiar results are obtained with 360k/720k in an 1.2MB drive, although the
number of "Reset floppy called" may differ.
The data don't seem to be corrupted.

Is this the normal behaviour (I had this with 0.12 already!) - can't
I use several formats on one drive type?

BTW: I can't remember exactly, but it seems somebody had patches to mtools
which allowed copying (mread/mwrite) to/from stdout/stdin with file - .
Could this guy drop me a mail with the patches???

2.
Maybe I'm wrong, but should'nt compile at least the kernel _without_ any
warnings?
I applied the Alpha patches from Linus to 0.95a and get several (not too much,
but some warnings) (using gcc1.40) - ok its Alpha only, I know,
but I think its a priciple question.
BTW: It would have been nice, if somebody had mentioned to use patch 
with "-l" (or is it assumed, that Alpha testers guess it themselves?).
With me the patches work, but sometimes with very hard disk traffic
(swapping during 2 parallel compilations and several background
"ls -lR / &") I get HD timeout which don't seem to corrupt the results.

3.
I applied the patches for extended partitions (by Charles Hedrick,
22 Mar 00:33 GMT). This is what I get after makeing a new kernel and
booting:

[stuff about partitions on disk 1 and 2 - seems ok]
[but shouldn't end and start of two partitions differ by one ?]
harddisk I/O error
dev 0303, block 0
Unable to read partition table of device 303
[but the extended drive within hda3 was recognized already with exact size!]
part 4 [ .... start size end stuff]
Partition tables ok
Kernel panic. Unable to mount root [Why that ??? Root is 304!]

Why is there anything about 303 ? Root device is 304! (BTW 303 is
an extended DOS partition with one drive! - see below)
Why is the partition table on the second extended partition on the
second physical drive recognized ok ?
Maybe this is due to the fact, that 303 contains one DRDOS6 drive, compressed
with SuperStor???? If that is the case, why not simply ignoring it
(with a warning) - Mounting Root should be possible anyway!

My disk setup : 2 drives IDE, first Quantum 50MB, second Seagate 3144A (123MB).
3 partitions on drive 1 (2,3,4 - 3 is extended with one drive, Linux root is 4),
4 on drive 2 (1-4, 3 is extended with one drive, 2 is Linux swap, 4 is
mounted Linux partition)
I could mail additional data about my partitions if anybody want - don't want
to post them.

4.
Shouldn't create Linux a core-file after dieing a process with
segmentation fault ?

5.
A shutdown script would be very nice. Anybody working on it or another
way to go to single user mode and back to multiuser?


Greetings from Germany

Andreas.

Subject: Problems with terminal on ttys2
Date: 25 Mar 92 14:18:55 GMT

Well, I noticed the support for /dev/ttys[34] in the kernel under .95a, and
was extremely happy to be able to move my modem off to ttys3!  It works GREAT!

Anyway, as with all things, now I have another problem.  Having cleared ttys2,
I re-enabled my multi-IO boards "COM2", and tried hooking up my other PC as
a terminal (my wife wants to play nethack while I work, and being able to
share the modem would be nice too).  

Having added this line to my /etc/rc:

                /bin/stty 9600 < /dev/ttys2 > /dev/ttys2

and adding this line to /etc/inittab:

                ttys2:vt100:/bin/getty 9600 ttys2

and connecting the two machines with a null-modem (actually a smart-cable that
is acting like a null-modem), I get garbage when the machine first puts up 
the "welcome to linux" message, and no keystrokes on the remote machine ever
seem to get back into /bin/login.  I have tried running kermit out over ttys2,
and get a repeatable sequence that makes *NO* sense what-so-ever, and again,
no keystrokes on the remote machine are ever displayed by kermit.

I have tried all parity/speed combinations that my hardware supports, so now I
am finally saying:

         HAS ANYONE GOTTEN THIS TO WORK, AND IF SO, HOW??

        I AM SURE IT IS A NUMB-SKULL CONFIGURATION PROBLEM

                        BUT I CAN'T FIND IT! 

Thanks,
-abc

This doesn't really help chuck but I compiled mtools under 0.95a last night
and I can access drive C: fine.

Subject: gcc1.4 and mtools
Date: 25 Mar 92 09:50:01 GMT

Firstly, thanks to all those who sent me suggestions about how to
get gcc 1.4 installed and working.  I don't think I quite followed
anybody's suggestions exactly, but this is what I did:

1. Got include-0.12.tar.Z fromt tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/system
   Untarred it in the root diretcory / of my linux system

2. Got newgcc.tar and untarred in directory /usr of my linux system

3. Got newlibc.tar.Z from tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/lib and
   extracted limits.h and placed this in /usr/include

4. Linked *all* of what was in /usr/lib to /usr/local/lib:

   ln -s /usr/lib/* /usr/local/lib

   (I still got some funny error message if I only linked cc1 and cpp)

And that was that.

To compile mtools, I untarred mtools-2.0.5.tar.Z
from hpb.mcc.ac.uk (130.88.200.7) in pub/linux/tools into / on my linux 
system (the mtools files are placed in a new /mtools directory).

The Makefile seems to expect a compiler called cc rather than gcc, so I just
copied gcc to make a new command called cc (I didn't know what else to do, but
there is probably an easier way - just changing the line LD = cc in the 
Makefile didn't work).  I left the Makefile file as it was.

Then I edited devices.c to include a devices structure for my DOS disk 
drives.  This is full of #ifdefs which I didn't like the look of so I copied
the dell entries, deleted the #ifdef and #endif lines and edited them as
follows:

struct device devices[] = {
        {'A', "/dev/flpy", 0L, 12, 0, (int (*) ()) 0, 80, 2, 18},
        {'C', "/dev/dos", 0L, 12, 0, (int (*) ()) 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {'\0', (char *) NULL, 0L, 0, 0, (int (*) ()) 0, 0, 0, 0}
};

(Drive A is 1.44 Mb 3.5 inch floppy - see the Configure file for others.
 My drive C is only 15 Mbytes, so it is FAT 12, but anything bigger is 
probably FAT 16)

Then entering the make command, and a cup of coffee and it was all done.  
I linked the device names I used in devices.c to the actual disk 
device names:

ln -s /dev/PS0 /dev/flpy
ln -s /dev/hda1 /dev/dos

And yippee, mcopy, mdir, etc all worked.  

Thanks again for the help - the above may not be the most elegant way to
do it - apologies, but I don't know any better!

Jim

   I'm wondering if anyone has, or knows a way I can obtain or create,
   a VAX cross compiler (for a MicroVAX) that will run under Linux?
   I both some variant of CC as well as an assembler-- (gcc and gas
   would be great, but can they be built under Linux to compile for
   a VAX?)  As far as libraries go, I can probably just build most
   of them from the Linux sources, once I have the compiler/assembler,
   or I can get them from a local site here, if the a.out format
   is compatable with the BSD format.
   Do I need a new version of ld, too, or is it generic enough to work
   with any system that uses the same a.out?

This goes back to the same old issue of how to get GNU cc and ld built
properly to cross-compile.  It's not hard to get the compiler to
cross-compile (find a gcc source distribution and read the doc files) for a
given architecture, but it's a royal pain getting gld to do the right thing
across architectures.  I tried doing this in the reverse direction - I
tried to build a cross environment to build Linux executables from both a
Sparc and a VAX.  I could do everything but the ld step, and I eventually
gave up (for now).

You may have better luck than I.  Part of the problem with what I was
trying to do I bet results from the FSF not testing it with a 386 sysV
target (there aren't many of them widely available).  On the other hand, I
bet the VAX target has been extensively tested, so maybe it'll be doable.

To get started, find the latest gcc and binutils source distributions
(prep.ai.mit.edu is the canonical distribution point), and start studying
the doc files (you'll need to know how to run tex and view/print .dvi
files).  It's supposed to be easy to build cross-development environments.

Can anyone explain why it seems to be so difficult to get gcc 2.0 running
under Linux?  It's supposed to "just work" off-the-shelf, right?  I mean a
386/387 SysV object in a.out format is pretty generic, why are there Linux
issues involved (I'm sure I'm just being ignorant - educate me)?  Are any
of the problems being encountered relevant to trying to build a gcc that
runs under Linux but produces code for a VAX or Sparc?  If so (I doubt it),
Frank would presumably need to start building his tools from the sources
ported to Linux, not the vanilla GNU distributions.

Gcc2.0 can be found under "/pub/linux/bianaries/compilers/gcc2.0" directory
at  ftp site tsx-11.mit.edu.

But I just learnt from some body else that that one doesn't have shared
libarary, and you need to get the newer version of gcc2.0 from ftp site
dec1.eecs.wsu.edu.

Happy hacking.

Subject: Bug in gets()
Date: 25 Mar 92 16:45:03 GMT

Just one day I fooled around with gets() and found out about this oddity.

First some theory:

gets() reads characters from the stdin to an array up to a newline. When
gets() encounters a newline, it terminates the array it was building and
returns a pointer to it. It should return a pointer to NULL pointer if it
can`t read from stdin or there is some other kind of a problem.


Then the practical bits:

I had a line of code like this in my code:

        while(gets(foo[i++]) != NULL)
                ;

When this code digested an empty line (ie. a line that contained just the
newline character) gets() returned a NULL pointer. Clearly not at all what
I wanted!


And some background:

I compiled the code with the Gcc 2.0 (shared libraries) in Linux 0.95a. I
tried the same code in SunOS 4.1.2 and it worked just as it should, gets()
returns NULL pointer only at the end of file.

So, if someone who has the source for the libc could look this up.
