Any disk utility that includes a destructive read/write/verfiy low-level
tester will have the effect of wiping the disk.  Disk Manager is only one
of many that can accomplish this, as can ATDIAG.EXE in the freeware arena.

This may have been asked and answered before but I haven't seen it. So I
ask; Are there any plans to add support for and/or port threads to Linux?
That would make an extremely useful addition to Linux, IMHO.

Yes it is possible to do demand loading of a compresssed filesystem if instead
of compressing the entire file, you compress each page. (There is a OS that
does this, unfortuanantly I don't remember the name.)

Subject: I'm working on init/login, etc...  Got problems.
Date: 30 Jan 92 08:19:47 GMT

Greetings,
    I'm hacking away on the entire init/login/utmp/wtmp/etc. bit, and have
a few questions...

    I started with the qpl-init package (TNX1.0E6 to the author!),
proceeded to figure out WHAT it needed, where, and why.  Discovered
that pwd_entry library calls (in my library) were messed up.  (Don't
ask why.  I don't know.  They're probably not wrong in your system.  I
was playing around a lot...  *grin*)

    I'm currently looking for a password cracking program that comes with
its own 'crypt' function.  I'll dump that into libc.a, and add real password
support into the login routine.  (Actually, to be specific, I'm looking for
a Copylefted password cracking program with its own 'crypt' implementation.)

    Right now, I've got a bunch of things working (last login, mail
check, motd, nologins, hushlogin, etc.) and am wondering what else
folks want.  (The code's not pretty.  Nope, nope, nope...  When I get rid
of all the debugging #ifdef's, and put in some happy-happy comments, I'll
release it...)

    A lot of my code is stupid, but it works.  I'm not sure what to do about
quotas, so all I do is run a dummy program (/bin/quota) that does nothing
but return.  There are a few things like that.

    Right now I'm happy to avoid the kernel, since I don't even know what
the phrase, "Race condition" means.  (It sounds nasty, and I have my guesses,
but I'm willing to flat out say I don't know.)

    I've got some experience at writing system stuff before, and this is a
whole lot of fun!

    Can anyone point me in the direction of something (other than man pages)
which they want in the 'login' process?  (I'm following the man pages for
SunOS 4.1.1 (as I recall) login/init/utmp/wtmp.)

    I believe after I've got this done, 'who', and 'finger' will be
pretty easy to port, right?

    Apologies if I'm stepping on anyone else's toes with this.  Now, on to
my problems...

    Right now, my biggest problem occurs when 'init' starts up.  It starts
a process for '/dev/tty64' (my modem port).  I start the system up with a
machine already attached to the modem, and it happily displays a 'login: '
on it.  Furthermore, after 60 seconds, it happily displays a timed-out
message, and another 'login: '.

    The problem is twofold.  1)  All keyboard input from the modem is
ignored.  Completely.  Nothing seems to get through.  I see data coming
into the modem, but the login program doesn't respond at all.  Whassup?

    2) Whenever the 'init' program sends data to the modem (specifically,
the 'login' and 'timeout' message) whether there is a connection on it or
not, a GPI occurs.  (At least I think thats what it was.  Not there right
now, so I can't test it.)

    I'm lost, confused, dazed, baffled, and ignoring it.  *grin*

    I do have a third problem, unrelated to the previous two.  My drive
has a large number of 'fsck' errors coming up.  What do I do to fix this?
(It's annoying, and I think it may be causing some more serious problems.)

    In any case, if anyone else is working on init/login/etc., please get in
touch with me!  I figure you're probably better at it than I, and I'd love
to get info from you!

                                                --  Morgan Schweers

P.S.  My undying thanks to the person who ported GNU Emacs to Linux.  Thanks
    to them I haven't given up on this project.  (MicroEmacs was just TOO
    damn annoying!)

I'm sure there are others out there working on porting perl; please share your
experiences! I have only seen one reference, in December from John Kohl. I
seem to be having similar problems with numeric operations.

Hints for putative perl porters...

(1) get the bison binaries, get and build the other textutils-1.1 that aren't
already built for Linux, get tr from the BSD distribution; the Configure
program uses various things like uniq, sort, etc, and things are made much
easier if you can get Configure and variable substitution working before trying
to compile.

(1a) where can I get hold of source for expr? (yes, I know you can use sed
instead, but...)

(1b) problems with porting the textutils-1.1 sort. I think it's to do with
feof(fp) not working in Linux; I made it better by setting the appropriate
flag in the iobuf when fread returns zero, but sort still requires two EOF's
before exiting; no problem when reading from pipes, but still a bit flakey.

(2) get and port gdbm-1.5 to Linux; works fine as long as the file locking
fnctl's are commented out.

(3) compile perl's eval.c and toke.c without optimisation; compilation fails
with -O with 4Mb (no swap).

(4) comment out references to telldir() and seekdir() in doio.c.

(5) do `#undef HAS_GETLOGIN' in perl.h (is there an equivalent to getlogin()
in Linux?) 

After this, perl builds fine and will pass many tests, but rounding errors are
causing many tests to fail. Is this a basic problem with s/w FP support in
libc.a/the kernel (I have no 387)? Any tips will be appreciated.

Careful, getchar() and gets() are stdio routines which talk to
stdin which may or may not be a keyboard.  Having them flush
stdout before they did anything would be pathological.

Setting the output unbuffered would work, but better you should do the
flush yourself since that's the right place to do it.  SunOS (and other
stdio implementations) do a flush after every printf(), etc. for you if
the output is directed to a tty.  A kludge for lazy programmers that
just complicates a stdio implementation -- I'm glad that linux leaves
it out.

Several people claim the way to do this is to have DOS boot off the Hard
drive and put a floppy into drive A to boot Linux when necessary.

>

80 Meg is plenty, according to most responces, but it depends on how much
other stuff I need, and, of course, when X11R5 shows up, I will quickly fill
the 80 Meg drive.

So, after my next pay check, I'll order the drive and get to the it.
What is the expected release date of the next version of Linux?  How
about ver 1.0?

Thanks for all the responces,

Jim

Subject: Linux kills children!
Date: 30 Jan 92 12:55:29 GMT

Hello all.

Can someone explain this to me.
I have re-installed linux on my second hard disk (42mb device, partitioned
to 1*33mb partition and a 9Mb partition (which I will use as swapspace))
and sometimes I can boot fine, but four times out of five the system dies with
this scrolling up the screen ad infinitum:

Child x died with code 000b
General protection 0000
EIP: o000f:0000CDC0
EFLAGS: o00010202
ESP: o0017:03BFFD48
fs: 0010
base 08000000, limit: 04000000
Stack: 0000CB2E 03BFFFD7 0004A88C 00000004
Pid: x, process nr:2
00 89 00 83 00 3c 00 75 00 c8

where x is a number starting with 1 and incrementing by 1 every time it scrolls
up the screen.
Linux runs very happily with a floppy as a root file system, but as you know
that's about as useful as a chitsu as a guard dog, so I'm sure it's not
my actual computer. I can also mount the HD and copy to it OK, it's just
very very tempremental on booting. The hard disk is also fairly new.
The controller is an AT-size MFM job (of unknown make), and this is the
part I suspect (I have a spare Western Digital one at home which I'm tempted
to try out).
If anyone else has had this problem, and fixed it, and patched the kernel
let me know where the bootimage is (C sources/patches are utterly useless
to me unless I can compile Linux on a Sun4 and run it on a 386 ;-))
If anyone knows the cause of this, also let me know!

Hi netters/linuxers:

  I need some advice/help in the following areas:

1) I compiled and installed linux on /dev/hd2 and now I boot using shoelace.
   I get the prompt for selecting SVGA modes but then I don't get a chance to
   respond. All the booting is over in a flash. Right now I don't care but
   I am interested in responding to this prompt some time. 

2) tsx-11.mit.edu has at least two versions of include files (one is normal
   /usr/include the other is linux-0.12.include) and libc.a (one with gcc the
   other as a seperate file). They don't look the same. How do I deal with
   these multiple files.

3) I got the latest virtcons patches from nic.funet.fi (Oh my! it was diffcult
   to get anonymous login to this host - limit of 16 mmmm....) and applied them
   now I use setterm to fix colors etc. But is there a complete manual for
   setterm any where? (it is nice to have ps. again manual pages?)

4) Where can I find termcap for the different kind of virtual consoles? 
   like con80x25 or other stuff. This is quite important as I got Gnu emacs
   and it behaves strangely with TERM = con80x25.

5) Are the virtual con pathces and fd patches nonoverlapping? i.e., can I
   apply the fd patches now after applying virtcon patches? 

6) I need to use my printer. If I understand correctly, Linux 0.12 does not
   have /dev/lp and my attempt with lp patch from tsx-11.mit.edu did not
   succeed ( infact, I flamed my frustrations (sorry :-( on this already but
   no reply. So I decided to be polite and ask :-)

7) And finally, can any one tell me where I can get the patches for rename
   system call? More importatnly if this is available is it all right to apply
   this patch after virtual cons and fd (and may be the correct lp patch).

Thank you very much for your time.

Ramesh
