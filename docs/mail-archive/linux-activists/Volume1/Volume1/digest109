Hello linux users,
        I'm new at this and my question is definitely not found on the
FAQ.  Can someone give some very detailed instructions as to how I can
set up linux so that it'll boot from muy harddrive?

        I've tried using shoelace; however, I could not seem to get it
to work.  The instructions may be too cryptic for me.  Well, specifically,
the instructions in shoelace tells me to copy the file "shoelace" onto the
boot disk, but each time I try to copy the file, it tells me "not owner."
Are there other ways to get linux to boot from the harddrive?

THANKS A MILLION :-)

The BIOS routines in most computers
will report the MAXIMUM size supported by a disk - in your case,
15 sectors.  The linux boot program says "Hey, this is a 5.25"
high density drive, so I'll read 15 sectors for each track".  This is 
the mechanism which allows the same immage to be used on 1.2M, 1.44M,
720K, and 360K drives, unlike DOS where the bootrecord has the 
information hard coded into at as to what type of disk it is.

But since it really is a low density disk, sectors 10 - 15 are just not 
there.

The error codes mean sector 10 not found.

Several things you can do : 
1.  Write it out to a disk formatted high density (you can
        format a 360K disk highdensity - although 
        you will get a few bad tracks near the end,
        the first 800K on most disks is useable, and 
        we only really need to first 200K

2.  Try setting disk type to 360K for the SX A:.

But that's a REAL 360K drive, and BIOS will report the capacity correctly.

It's easier to fill DOS floppys with files than to calculate how many 
you can tar together and rawrite onto a diskette.  Am I missing something, 
or are we limited to one file to a diskette?  Anyway, you have to format the
disks under DOS anyway to use rawrite - why not leave them useable for
DOS again when you've got Linux running?

  IMHO, most people who receive a new copy of linux will get it
in the form of disk images stored as compressed files on MS-DOS floppys,
simply because that's the way they tend to get transferred.  If a person
downloads the files from a BBS, they naturally put 'em on a DOS disk.
 If the files get downloaded to a hard drive, all that would be necessary
is to boot Linux, and copy the files across partitions.

BTW: Even with all the wierd partition schemes, there are a finite number 
of combinations that people can have, so writing a generic mcopy to read 
HD's is not impossible, just a little harder. )

  What I'm trying to put across is that it makes sense to have more than 
one way to get files loaded into Linux.  I know there isn't that much
space on the root diskette, but this would seem to be a valuable addition.
 This is _one_ thing AST had working right in MINIX - he loaded the root
image into a RAM disk, freeing up a drive to load the /usr programs.

 Not really.  How would you like to be running PRODOS?  I don't subscribe
to all the DOS-bashing that seems to be going on these days.  I know 
DOS is _very_ limiting, and agree that it should be retired, but it 
served us well for a number of years and it deserves a little respect.

That's because the disk is full. Not owner is a great error message,
isn't it?  The same error is printed if you try and remove a directory
somebody is in, etc.   I think the gnu fileutilities need some
 more inteligence.....

Installing shoelace : 
1.  Copy the config, and disktab files from the distribution into /etc.
2.  Copy bootlace, winiboot, and laceup into /etc
3.  Copy shoelace into /shoelace

Now, do a 

laceup <rootpartition> wini

IE laceup /dev/hd1 wini for /dev/hd1 as root

Then, do a 

laceup -w <defaultpartition number> /dev/hd0 

Where this is the default partition you want to boot.

IE laceup -w 1 /dev/hd0 for /dev/hd1 as root

This installs winiboot 

That's it.  before rebooting, make sure you have a bootable kernel
in the correct place.  I changed my configuration file to boot
/vmunix.  You can also <SPACE> out of the default when 
shoelace loads up, and boot anything on the harddisk - great 
for kernel hackers.

Note that what you omitted was the "testing" part of the 
shoelace installation.  It works - just don't screw up and
do anything stupid.  laceup /dev/hd0 * with no -w *
will trash your partition table.

Backing up the partition table : 

Before you install winiboot, you -might- want to 
back up your partition table.  This is most easily 
accomplished with 

dd if=/dev/hd0 bs=512 count=1 of=ptable

And you can put ptable on floppy.      

that's it.  Works like a charm...

Well, I use Mtools all the time. I have excellent communication programs
for DOS, which I can't say about Linux. As a result, I do most of my
downloading under DOS. I also keep most of the packed Linux stuff in
a DOS partition, because it's such a pain to fool around with rawrite,
tar and a bunch of floppies. It is MUCH easier to type
'mtype foo_tar.z | tar xz', which unpacks a .tar.Z file straight from
the DOS partition and in no time at all.

I don't see why you have to try and pack everything on the root floppy
in the first place. It is my impression that the root floppy is mostly
useful only for getting a root file system onto the hard disk. Period.
Why not make a third distribution image, which has all the best tools
on it: tar, un/compress, mtools, bash, the works? After you've got
your hd root file system up and running, it's a piece of cake to mount
the tool image and copy the rest of the stuff.

This is silly. I'm willing to bet that most Linux users are running
a hybrid system, with both DOS and Linux on it. In such a system there
will always be a lot of data shuttling back and forth between the two.
In my opinion, we should go for the most convenient way to do things,
which at the moment is Mtools, without doubt. I don't expect anyone will
write anything compareable for DOS anytime soon...

I for one don't want to put up with unnecessary contortions just because
it's 'standard' Unix. I agree that the root floppy shouldn't contain
any unnecessary stuff, though.

I agree. If someone wants to write DOS file system for Linux, I won't
kick up a fuss, but it really isn't important, not urgent.

The problem here is that the linux boot-sequence asks the BIOS what kind
of drive you are running on, gets the answer "1.2M drive" and tries to
read 15 sectors/track. This obviously won't work. Use a high-denstity
diskette, and live with the fact that the kernel uses only 15% of the
capacity.

Ok: this one is a totally unrelated problem.  Now the bios reports the
correct kind of disk, so the system loading goes all right.  After that
the bootup sequence tries to determine the root-disk type, and finds out
it's not a gigh-density floppy, and dies.  It should really print out an
error-message, but there was no space left in the boot-sector, so it
doesn't, it just goes into a loop waiting for a reboot. 

If you have only a 360kB drive, I don't see how to install linux. The
root-disk simply won't fit on 360kB - even 1.2M is a bit tight. If you
have a bigger B: drive, you might swap cables, and use that as A:

Yes, this is a pretty major weakness of Linux - Kermit and Pcomm are
nice, but they simply aren't up to the standards of most of the DOS
terminal programs.  Of course, I've gone the opposite route as you and
just learned to 'deal with it'.  I miss my old term program in a way,
but I've found I can get just as much done using kermit or xc (another
term program that I've been working on porting).

I was responding to people who suggested mtools be on the root floppy,

That's my goal, too.  That means getting something like pfdisk on the
root floppy is more important to me than mtools.

A third distribution image would be nice, but would go against trying
to keep the distribution small - some people are not going to want to
download 3 megs just to install an experimental operating system.
That's why I'd like to get as much as possible, and as much as
necessary, on one root disk.  Tar and compress are important enough
that definitely deserve to be on there....

>This is silly. I'm willing to bet that most Linux users are running

As am I.  But, the only reason I still have DOS around is for business
purposes - I still have to do some programming under DOS.

>In such a system there will always be a lot of data shuttling back and

Are you sure?  The last time I moved anything from DOS -> Linux was
probably the 0.12 kernel, and I'm sure there are also others that are
making the transition away from DOS, just as many people have moved
away from Minix.

But remember, not even mtools is that easy to configure and set up to
use the hard drive.  rawrite and tar work 'out of the box.'

I'm glad we're agreed on this.  It's too bad some people aren't.

I wouldn't say it's not important, but it's not urgent.  I think it
would be nice to find something more flexible than mtools, which I
think a DOS filesystem would be.  Then you aren't limited by the set
of tools that mtools gives you.

Also, keep in mind in all this that I'm not saying mtools shouldn't
even exist for Linux - that'd be silly.  I'm just saying that it is
not important enough to be on the root floppy.  If people want to use
mtools, they'll only have to use rawrite three times in their life.
(Root floppy, boot floppy, and mtools.tar!)

70 kB should be enough. If you merge all the mtools parts into a single
executable and link mattrib, mcd, etc. to it, it's only 62 kB (42 kB
compressed, probably less with gcc 2.0).

The devices database could be loaded at run-time. If you stuff everything
into a single binary, this gets even easier (single entry point).

I've just built such a merged mtools and it seems to work. A better way to
handle the devices database is still missing, but that shouldn't be
difficult. It will need a lot of testing and I'll have to discuss this
with the author, so I wouldn't expect this to get released before next
weekend.

By the way, is there an 'official' Zmodem port yet ? Or is anybody working
on it ?
