I tried to run patch and it says "Hmm .. looks like a ed file" (or something)
/bin/ed:  no such file (or something)

Do I need ed to run patch, and if so where is ed?

Thanks.

Subject: problems with doshell /dev/tty sh &
Date: 2 Feb 92 03:47:49 GMT

I have been trying to add a second user via a Televideo 905 
terminal connected to COMM 2.  The command I use to run the
second shell is: doshell /dev/tty65 sh & as suggested in a 
previous posting.  (Sorry, I don't have it anymore so I can't
give proper credit :( ).

The problem is that only linefeeds are being sent at the end of 
lines.  For example, cat'ing a file gives something like this:

line1
     line2
          line3....

Does anyone know what needs to be changed, or have any suggestions
as to where to start looking?


Thanks very much.

hi all;
       sorry about the confusion.
       the file checkpoint.h is NOT necessary for the compilation of
       lp.c. remove the line #include <checkpoint.h> and any occurances
       of CHECKPOINT you may find. i thought i had gotten all that out.
       thanks for the positive feedback also.

       ps. for the curious:
       #define CHECKPOINT fprintf( stderr, "checkpoint reached at line %d in
       file %snr", __LINE__, __FILE__ );
                                         ^note
       pps. i am still working on a TODO list, will post soon.
       ppps. i wrote a version of doshell that setsid's & is 60% smaller.
             source will follow.
       pppps. ibm cms MAIL sucks!

groff needs g++, which we don't have yet. I've got cawf set up here, and
it's a cinch to compile. It's available as cawf2.zip from the txtutl
directory in simtel20 and mirror sites. It works for simple man pages,
but dies if things get too weird.

I set up nroff as a symlink to cawf and it works fine, it's faster to
preformat the pages anyway, though.

Hmm.  I've been giving this matter a lot of thought lately, and have
come the conclusion that I must also disaggree with the decision
to have malloc(0) return NULL.  Here are my reasons:

        1)      A NULL return from malloc() signifies an error that,
                according to my programmer's manual, means
                "...there is no available memory [or] the arena
                has been detectably corrupted by storing outside
                the bounds of a block".  This is very unlikely
                for a request for 0 bytes.

        2)      Given the fact that malloc(0) is OK, there are
                circumstances that I can envision where the use of such
                a feature will lead to more efficient code.

                Consider the following code fragments:

                /* --------------------------Case 1----------------- */
                BlockSize = 0;
                BlockPointer = malloc(0);       /* OK to do this */

                while( BlockPointer && WeWantToContinue )
                    {
                    BlockSize += SomeOperationThatNeedsMemory();
                    BlockPointer = realloc( BlockPointer, BlockSize );

                    /* Do error checking, memory operations, whatever */
                    . . .
                    }

                if ( BlockPointer )
                    free( BlockPointer );

                /* ------------------Case 2------------------------ */
                BlockSize = 0;
                BlockPointer = NULL;

                while( WeWantToContinue )
                    {
                    BlockSize += SomeOperationThatNeedsMemory();

                    if ( BlockPointer )
                        BlockPointer = realloc( BlockPointer, BlockSize );
                    else
                        BlockPointer = malloc( BlockSize );

                    /* Do error checking, memory operations, whatever */
                    . . .
                    }

                if ( BlockPointer )
                    free( BlockPointer );

        Small points?  Maybe. But I *LIKE* saving as many nanoseconds as
I can. ( I've got a whole drawer full :-) )

In trying to compile GNU make 3.63 I found that SIGBUS and SIGSYS aren't
defined in /usr/include/signal.h.  SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are where SIGBUS
and SIGSYS are on our Sun systems.  Did POSIX change where these are, or
is signal.h incorrect.

Subject: harddrive problems (IDE, in a 486)
Date: 2 Feb 92 08:51:42 GMT

Greetings *.

After letting Minix-386 get stale sitting unused on my HD, I decided to
try out Linux.  Wow... impressive.  I am having so problems though.

My setup is a 200M IDE, I'm using the partitions I had setup with Minix
(hd1 = 120M DOS, hd2 = 32M Minix, hd3 = 1M Minix, hd4 = 32M Minix).
I re-mkfs'd hd[2-4], because I wanted to use the -c option instead of
using the .Badblocks (only have one error on the drive, and the -c 
seemed to find it).  

I copied most of the root-image disk onto hd3 (bin etc dev tmp) and put
usr onto hd2.  Changing the value at the offset on the bootdisk got
me no where.  The system would boot up, say it was "dev 0303" then
start barfing out error messages, finally to lock up with the drive
spinning.  

I also discovered that my hd2 and hd4 were beign mangled... the only
thing I did to them was copy files onto them.  For hd2, I mounted it
to /user, then copied all of the root-image /usr/bin and /usr/root
files.. using cp +recursive, the copy would complete, but unmounting
and fscking the drive showed massive amounts of problems.  I then tried
copying each file individually with a shell loop (for i in `ls /usr/bin`)
and kept getting HD timeout errors then lots of error-message-ish stuff
when it would finally lock up and die.

Are there patches that will take care of this?  On floppies, it seems to
be fine.  :-)  I got the boot and root-images off of tsx-11 ~92Jan29.
My machine setup is generic, for the most part.  A 486/33, IDE drive, 
SVGA card.. the CMOS is setup to shadow nothing.

Could my problem be my partitions?  I had thought that if I had used
Minix' fdisk I wouldn't have any problems.

Thanks.

Greetings,
    I found the same thing in my porting Mush (Mail Users SHell) to
Linux.  All I did was to duplicate the SIG values...  It doesn't hurt
anything, I think.  (Make the patch to signals.h...)

    Alright, I've got BSD-login working (YEAH!), along with BSD's 'who'
program (YES!  I have *TWO* users, and their names are CORRECT!  YES!)
I'm working on 'su', and I'm also trying to figure out how tough getting
a "real" getty would be...  (BSD's, again.)

    The problem here is that I've made a *LOT* of changes (such as
extensive additions to the libc.a, and a bunch of changes to the
include files...)  Making binaries available is *REAL* easy.  What I need
is some poor soul willing to take the *SOURCE* I give them and tell me
if they can build a new 'login', etc., from it.

    I'm still using a self-patch version of qpl's init package, 'cause
it works, and well.

    I'm not sure if half of what I did to port 'login' was the
'pretty' or 'proper' thing to do (such as building a 'strcasecmp' and
'strncasecmp', putting it in a 'bsdlib.c' file in the library source
area and recompiling it into libc.a!)  but it works, right now.

    In all honesty, the porting was pretty straightforward.  (I diked out
parts of code that I didn't understand and that didn't seem to have an
effect I needed.)  So, anyone willing to be a test-victim?  (*grin*)

                                                     --  Morgan Schweers

P.S.  The 'login' program is from BSD, the crypt portion is ufc-crypt,
    a lot of the support routines were taken straight off of uunets
    bsd-sources directory, and the entire thing was managed by referring
    to SunOS manpages.  *grin*

Yes.  You have to patch the kernel.  Change the 0x3f8's at the 
top of in tty_init() in linux/kernel/chr_drv/tty_io.c to 0x3e8's.  
This will make DOS COM3: your /dev/tty65
