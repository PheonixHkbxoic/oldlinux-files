I have a DTK 386-20 mother board.  I haven't had any problems with the  
board or linux not working with the board.  I have been running linux  
since January.

        I don't know what high I/O rates are, but I have run a serial  
network at over 56k baud on my board under DOS.  If the high I/O rates  
refer to drive access, then I do have a slow drive.   :-(

Subject: Problem with gdb
Date: Wed, 25 Mar 1992 19:35:54 GMT

When using gdb, why does this error message occur when a getchar() is 
encountered in my program ? 

[ioctl TIOCSPGRP failed in terminal_inferior: Not owner]

This occurs both when I am root and when I am myself. I'm using LINUX 0.95a 
with gcc-1.40 and my program was compiled successfully with the -g option.
This error does not occur on my school's HP workstations, so I imagine I'm
setting up something incorrectly. Any ideas?

All-
  I am having trouble getting pcomm to recognize my com1 port.  For
a tty I have tried: tty0 and tty1 however I get no response from either.
I have used minix and I seem to remember something in the rc file that
initizlized the com1 port: stty 2400 </dev/tty1.  Do I need to initialize
the port?  If so, where can I find the binary for stty?

I enjoyed using term, sz, and rz with minix -- is there a linux counterpart?

                      Thanks-

       Some cheapo 486 clones don't work properly in 32-bit mode.
I ran into this on a Greenleaf machine, which may have had a DTK
motherboard.  It passed Checkit, the PC diagnostic program, and would
happily run 8086 or 286-type programs, but anything that kicked it into
32-bit mode, like a program using a DOS extender, would crash.  

       I returned the computer and bought a Mac instead.

I think it is a little unfair to see things quite like this.  First
of all, Linux has 14 character file names.  Secondly, this is not
because Linus wanted Linux to have 14 character file names, but
because the Linux file system is inherited from an older system
with which it had to be compatible.  Thirdly, work is in progress
on a new file system for Linux which is not subject to this limitation.
And finally, note that the 14 character file name limit is the one
specified by the current Posix standard (which, however, allows
a conforming system to permit longer file names).

This may have resulted from giving 'mount' the wrong device --
/dev/PS0 for 3.5 inch 1.44 Mb disk on your A drive, /dev/at1 for
5.25 inch 1.20 Mb disk on your B drive.  Horrible, but likely to
change, it would seem.

In this case, I prefer Linux's behaviour to BSD's.  I suppose one could
rewrite the mount system call to unmount anything mounted on an existing
mount point, but all sorts of things become problems (i.e., the cwd
of all existing processes, log files being written, files like /etc/mtab
that contain information which should not be lost, etc).  The unixes
I know do not allow this, but I have the (adjective deleted) fortune
not to have any BSD systems to manage.

According to bash documentation, the .bashrc and .bash_profile files are
sourced only if bash is not called sh, and in the latter case, if bash
is executed as a login file.  The version of doshell.c published in
this list starts up bash (or any shell) with a '-' at the start.
Anyway, if it is named 'sh', a bash login shell reads the file ~/.profile.
Either use that or link /bin/sh to /bin/bash.

OK, I'm about to give up on GCC 2.0 for now, sob!  I tried both the 92-03-24 and
92-03-25 versions and with both cpp would hang in processing hello.c.

I CAN compile with 1.40 and link with 2.0 to get a small 5K working executable.
Is this legitimate?  Is the cpp hang a problem known by anyone else?

Thanks in advance for ideas/info.  Compiling with 2.0 would be great!

Reply-To: chad@src.umd.edu (R Michael McMahon)
Date: Thu, 26 Mar 1992 01:55:49 GMT

The seagate driver is not working on my system (386/7, Phoniex BIOS,
C&T chipset). I can boot with 0.95a without SCSI support, and have
no problems except the lack of a harddisk. Using the latest 0.95a 
SCSI bootimage (ftp'ed on 3/23), here are the diagnostics:

Host 0 is detected as a(n) Seagate ST-01/ST-02.
Seagate ST-0X SCSI dirver by Drew Ekhardt
$Header .....blah.... $
1 Host adapters detected
Detected SCSI disk at host 0, ID 0, lun 0
Detected SCSI disk at host 0, ID 1, lun 0
Detected 2 disks, 0 tapes total
Kernel panic: scsi_done() called with invalid host number

(Note: I have a Quantum 105s and a Seagate 296N installed. The 
 panic occurs with either or both drives attached.)

I have not moved any jumpers on the ST-02, meaning on-board BIOS is
at the default location, etc.

Any help for this would be appreciated. In particular, is there a way
for me to recompile (or a place to ftp) a SCSI bootimage with full
debug options? I don't have a non-scsi HD in order to do this on
my system very easily.

I have access to the Adaptec driver written by James da Silva of U.M. 
(he works upstairs!) for Minix. As soon as my Seagate is working, I
will work on porting James' driver to my Adaptec. Any others working
on this task, please send e-mail so we can collaborate.

In that series of questions, I asked about Kermit 5A not displaying

This is (should be) in the FAQ. newgcc installs cpp and cc1 in /usr/lib,
but they should be somewhere on your path instead. Just link them with
ln -s.

Alpha release? Beta release? Prerelease? You can pick your term but it is
hardly experimental. I am "playing" with it because I don't have a machine
(yet) that I can dedicate for it (I have a small partition setup on my PC
at work mostly for trying it out and learning the internals). But once I
get my home machine I plan to use Linux as my main OS (it helps that all I
need is gcc, emacs, sc [for my finances ofcourse] and a few other odds and
ends.) Most of the tools are all available on the net. As for the few that
aren't I believe I can put together something usuable with the existing tools.
I have never needed nor am a big fan of GUIs. Other than that "usability",
the value added by commercial OS' is kinda dubious (may be good for the
average Joe Sixpack, but not for me or most of the people reading this group).

We all agree we like Unix. Let's not propagate past sins just because they
are/were 'standard'. If there is a better tool for the job, let's use it.
The standard be damned.
