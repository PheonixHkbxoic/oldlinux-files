hi all;
       normally i am an easy-going fellow but this has been a bad week for me.
       so i'll take it out on you all :-)

       PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE if you download a package PLEASE read
       EVERYTHING that comes with it.

       there must have been 20 messages or so in the past two days that
       went like this:

       > i downloaded x and i can't get it to do y

       and his brothers:
       > i'm looking for foo and i can't find it
       > the file george is missing the author must be a creep
       > when is feature zzyzzyx going to be written i don't have the time

       i guess this is kind of redundant for all of you nice folk already
       reading this news letter.

       a couple of ideas:
       use ARCHIE.RUTGERS.EDU to search for files ( telnet: login archie )
       send E-MAIL to the package authors ( they WANT to know! )
       READ the documentation ( and not after you've gotten it to work! )
       FTP as much as you can. As Stroustrup said there are millions of
           lines of code out there. Port something to Linux!
       READ the source code! It really is 'creative writing'.

       well i guess i've wasted enough space saying there's too much mail.
       i just HAD to say something. and this IS better than digital controls
       homework.
              jim the cranky [v5068u@vm.temple.edu -- no .sig just BEEF]

       ps anybody still need the make fixed for uids !=0 ?

        The idea of free public domain software is to give me a backrub.
        The idea of free public domain software is to do the dishes.
        The idea of free public domain software is to mow my lawn.

Instead of porting BSD tr, you can use GNU tr.  The patches
I used for GNU textutils 1.2, which includes tr, can be
obtained by anonymous ftp from hpb.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.200.7]
in /pub/linux/mcc-bin/textutils-1.2.tar.Z, which also contains
a compiled binary.

It is unfortunate that sys/param.h includes the file linux/fs.h,
in which there is a definition of 'struct file'.  This file
defines 'file' and other identifiers which may (and do)
occur in user programs.  Perhaps the globally accessible
prototypes and macros could be moved to another header file,
and the namespace-cluttering 'file', etc, isolated.

Some people write free software for different reasons than others; the
GNU manifesto explains a number of such reasons none of which are what
you've said.  It is best to refrain from such generalizations.

In the case of Linux, there is another practical obstacle: it depends
on the GNU C compiler, which needs at least 2 meg (preferably 4)
to run without thrashing its brains out, so even if the kernel
could run in a 512k machine you wouldn't be able to recompile it.
GNU C, by the way, needs considerably less memory than competing
C compilers such as Tartan C and the new Sun C compiler.

Sorry to spoil your fun, Andy used PC-IX.

Subject: tty_io.c
Date: Thu, 5 Mar 1992 13:26:05 GMT

Hi there.

I've made the mistake of sticking my nose somewhere where perhaps it doesn't
belong.  I want the ALT key to work inside of Emacs.  My fingers have learned
that the ALT key will work where Linux wants me to press ESC.  Quite
frustrating.  

So Ted suggested to me that I try adding a flag to the tty driver to select
whether 8-bit characters were sent through unfiltered, or preceded by an ESC.
This would make Emacs (and me) happy.

So, on to my question about the code.  I'm afraid I don't understand the
distinction between tty->readq, tty->writeq, and tty->secondary.  More
specifically, what is the diff between writeq and secondary.  

I hypothesize that secondary is the fully-cooked output which gets used, and
that write is used along the way to keep the console, etc  (and I guess the
user) updated.  Am I close here?  

Any help would be appreciated.

Also, can anyone tell me why this silly idea won't work.  Perhaps something
about Emacs that I don't understand.  (Like emacs uses raw mode.)

Thanks again.

George

Subject: Re: Linux installing bootimage
Date: 5 Mar 92 11:05:03 GMT

I run the following little shell script (on another unix box, or
on a pre-installed Linux box) to change the hard disk boot.

This is basically the mechanism many people employ to alter
binary files; other than one of the many public-domain binary editors.

In this example, "oldimage" is the source image, the new, patched
image will be in the file "newimage".  The script sets the boot device's
major number to 3, and its minor number to 1. (The echo line is
reversed because of the endian-ness of a 386.)

The idea behind this is to copy all of the file (1 byte at a time)
until you get to the 508th byte.  Copy two bytes to /dev/null.  
Echo the two replacement bytes, then copy the remainder of the
file.

 e.g.:

{ dd ibs=1 obs=1 count=508
  dd bs=1 count=2 of=/dev/null
  echo '\001\003\c'
  dd bs=16k
} < oldimage > newimage

Bzzzt, close, but wrong answer.  The platform Andy used was PC/IX, unix on
the 8088 written by ISC for IBM.  Close.  Actually, PC/IX is very similar
to Coherent, but they quit marketing it a long time ago.
