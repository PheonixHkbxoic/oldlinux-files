  My roommate is having the same problem with his 3.5".  He has a
Gateway 2000 386/25 and 4 meg RAM.
  I've tried it and got the "reser-floppy called" once and it worked
after it did that.   Curious.  It would seem that something was
overlooked, or there is a non standard here...?

   That was exactly my question two weeks ago. I didn't receive any answers,
   so I reconfigured everything. I now have a small partition (4Mb) on disk 1
   and my /usr and /home partitions are on disk 2. But the question remains.

Your / partition doesn't have to be bootable unless you don't want to
boot from floppy.  However, the BIOS in the computer won't go look at
the second drive for bootable partitions.

Hope this answers your questions.

broken?

How is it possible to entirely bypass the need for a boot floppy?  Can someone
give me a pointer here?

Alright, I've gotten 0.95, and now I'm trying to build the kernel, 
with gcc-1.40. Hmmm, I just read something about a flag to do this, but 
I know not what it is. Anyway, I've two problems:

        1) I had to turn off optimizations on two files, to get the 
thing to compile. (Something about program  getting signal xxx, where
xxx is an ever-increasing number that differs from make to make.) Well, 
this isn't really a problem, but it *is* interesting.

        2) When I get everything built, sync and reboot, I get through
the SVGA-modes thing, and then this bunch of garbage:

8 virtual consoles
4 pty's
stack segment: 0000
EIP: 0008:0000D2D6
EFLAGS: 10202
fs: 0010

Pid: 0, process nr:0
8b 45 cc 66 c7 04 cd e0 a4 00
Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space
In swapper task: not syncing

and that's it (no VC's, no login, C-A-D time.)

I don't have a swap space, but I do have 8 megs RAM. 
Any clues?

Hey!
I've noticed a new *feature* about the new boot image.
Because I've got a crummy 1.2 as my 'A' drive I've been using
boot_b to redirect my boot drive to my 1.44.  This situation worked
just fine with the .12 kernel, no matter how often I rebuilt it.  When
I use the same image in the 'A' and 'B' drives, the 'A' one is just fine,
but the 'B' one decides to jump my machine to a cold boot.

I think it was specified under /home that /home should contain all user hom

On another question: what is the rationale behind /usr/tmp anyway?  If
/tmp is allowed to be an installable system anyway, why not make /tmp

Excuse me for asking this question before RTFM... I don't yet have a
machine that I can run linux (or LINUX?) on for another month or so, but
does linux support installable filesystems, or is the Minix file system
hardcoded in?  If so, is anyone working on an DOS filesystems driver? I
know the DOS filesystem sucks majorly and I am not intending to use it for
anything serious, but I can see it being quite useful to allow shuttling
data between DOS and linux.  I presume most linuxers also are running DOS
on their machines, and if your machine is not directly connected to the
Internet one may wish to bring home new files on DOS floppies from another
machine.

Or am I completely looney?

        I have recently compiled FREEZE compression under Linux,
(was waiting for .95 release and needed SOMETHING to so), seems to
be working well! For those of you who haven't heard of FREEZE, it's
another UNIX-type compression program that sacrifices the speed of
COMPRESS for a better compression ratio.  From the little
experimenting I have done with it, a 15-20% smaller compressed file
results when using FREEZE opposed to COMPRESS!
As long as I have no troubles with it, I'll U/L it within the
next couple days to tsx-11.mit.edu and others...

        Now onto 0.95 problems, GCC 1.40 while linking likes to
cause file system protection errors...then all logins after that
fail with the same sort of errors!  I booted with a .12 boot disk onto
my installed .95 root drive, (probably a no-no, but the errors
disappeared then..:) AND HAVEN'T come back even booting from .95 boot
to the .95 root?!?  Also have noticed fewer unexpected HD interupts since
then too. Sorry I can't be more specific on the type of protection errors,
but it won't do it again...:)

The only thing BSD has over Linux is that no one is working on a faster file
system (as far as I know). Linux is much leaner than BSD and can probably
compete if we have the needed features.  
The other thing we need to consider is that there is no use making Linux
just a unix clone, we need to make it better :-) Otherwise BSD will win
out because of name recognition.
