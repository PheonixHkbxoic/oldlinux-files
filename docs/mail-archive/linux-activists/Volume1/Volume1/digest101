   at a guess, you are probably running vixie cron or something similar which
   attempts to kill it's forked processes but (i believe from a MUCH earlier
   posting) the SIGNAL to kill the child process isn't interperted or generated
   correctly and the child stops but doesn't release itself from the process
   table. (A quick check seems to show that this is true in 0.95 too 8()

I wrote that code, as far as I know it is correct.  The child doesn't
release itself from the process table because it is saving the exit
status.  It will be released form the process table when the parent
calls the wait() system call and obtains the exit status of the child
process, or when the parent exits and the child process is inherented by
process 1, which will reap all the exited child processes by calling
wait() on them.

This is standard Unix behavior.  Look in the book Design and
Implementaiton of BSD 4.3, for more details, under the topic of "Zombie
processes".

You might try creating a tar file (tar a 'tar.Z' file so the length info is
on the diskette - you don't want to read it all), then use 'rawrite' or 'dd'
to put this on a floppy.  Linux can then tar directly from the floppy.

I changed my directory structure to follow the proposed standard right after
installing 0.95. Unfortunately this installation somehow renders my .emacsrc
"invisible" to emacs - and I no longer can use the cursor keys etc. with
emacs, but they now "magically" work with vi (stevie)... Strange. Do I need
to re-compile emacs? With gcc 2.0?

I needed to re-compile df, as the old binary I had kept looking for my root
partition as /dev/hd7, not the current /dev/hdb2.

Other than the above, I am pleased with the .95 release so far - it's nice
to be able to log in as someone other than root... By the way, does anyone
have any newusr (or similar) commands for setting up new logins in /etc/passwd?
Manually editing it is annoying. Btw - where can I find crypt? I'd prefer to
have the passwords encrypted.

Everybody seems to be having problems withh the terminal scrolling.  Well, so
do I, but I have some different problems.  Basically, as well as getting the
weird characters printed when you scroll too much, keys also start to get lost
(or at least reordered).
In emacs, I've set my keyboard up so that The PgUp and PgDn keys do page
scrolling.  But when you press it rapidly, the order of the control codes seems
to get mixed up in the keyboard buffer (this only happens when scrolling is
occurring too, so it could be timing or concurrency problems) and I get "[A"'s
everywhere in my text (annoying, it's difficult to get them out again) and
occasionally emacs runs the ESC ESC command as well (there's usually at least
one ESC that gets picked up as a command instead of a control code, anyway).

One other thing - I like using DOS editors where Shift-F1 is different to plain
F1.  Can we agree on a standard to allow these to have different control codes?
Particlularly, Shift, Ctrl, Alt func. keys, keypad and arrow keys, so that I
can mess about with my emacs setup.

I should say I will play with all of these problems when I get time, which at 
this rate will be 1995...

Thoughts on the standard distribution : 
Why not have one root image, with "The absolutely minimum needed to 
read in the rest of of other tars and get a file system made", with 
the rest on other tars, etc.

This would be 
sh 
mkdir
mkfs
mknod
rm
rmdir
cp
ls
tar 
compress
fsck

Whatever else fits on the root floppy is FINE.  But, I give 
tar and compress higher priority than init, login, getty, etc - 
as you can boot in single user mode.

-

Do a mkfs of the apropriate size on your favorite device 
(floppy, spare hard disk partition), copy what you want on to
it, and then dd from that device to a file.

     There is a program called Boot_b which writes to the boot block of a
  disk which you place in your A: drive... when the machine reads the block
  it switches to the B: drive and boots from there... I've used this to 
  boot linux from drive B: on quite a few different machines (gateways, ps/2)

Thanks to all those who wrote me with the answer (you can't have partitions
of more than 64k blocks).  I bet this is in the FAQ file, but I couldn't
find the file.  Sorry.

This limit isn't a big deal, I guess; I can split the disk into two or
three smaller partitions.  Is there any advantage to having small partitions
(like the files can be found faster)?

Another idle question (until the FAQ file comes around again):
Having to patch the boot disk to change root drives is tricky for those
without a C compiler under DOS.  I guess I could copy everthing over to the
hard drive and get gcc up first.  But wouldn't it be possible to include
that little program (a compiled version) in the installation notes on the
root disk?  Or why not have the boot code ask where the root drive is, just
like it asks about SVGA modes?  For that matter, can't one write a program
that runs under DOS to reboot into linux?

 Well, since everyone seems to be saying "It doesn't work", I thought
I'd just post a little positive note.  I've just completed a new
installation of Linux 0.95 on a friend's machine.  I can't use my
own because for the moment I'm stuck with a 286-12 :-(

 Anyway, I've gotten the same error message about "Floppy reset called"
as many as 10-12 times on the different machines I've booted Linux
(from floppy) on.  It never killed the operation completely, although
it did slow things down a bit.  I also have had the "unexpected HD
interrupt" message.  Again, this did not kill things completely.

 To get Linux installed, I had to do a great deal of raw reads and 
writes(rawrite, dd).  This doesn't bother me, but I think it would 
be a problem for most people who are installing linux for the first 
time.  We really need to free up some room on the root image and 
include a small, generic version of mtools' mread, mwrite and mcopy
on it.  This would _really_ help people who are trying to bootstrap 
from a previously DOS machine.  Also, a Linux fdisk is badly needed
on the same disk, since lots O' people are having problems with the
collection of other programs that are currently being used to do the 
partitioning.  I myself managed to nuke my friend's DOS partition
twice while doing the install(this could also be blamed on a sort 
of weird HD configuration, the Linux partition is number 2 on the
disk, but is accessed as hda4).

 If we can get these things and also some sort of simple installation
document together, we should be able to get quite a lot of people
using Linux :-)

BTW: We also need something that does the patching of the boot image
more or less automatically.

I'll be able to start writing some of these in about a month, when I get 
my new motherboard.  In the meantime, though, does anyone feel like a
little challenge?

I have now seen enough posts to know it wasn't my install at fault (I hope).
It seems the new 0.95 kernel will not compile fork.c or console.c with the
-O option (compiler died on signal xx), I've seen this beforee on SUNs 
using gcc so I take its a generic compiler bug? 

Worse if I build a kernel with gcc1.40, I get the:

Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space     

Before the root file system is mounted. gcc2.0 compiles and runs ok, but
I'd rather have a working gcc1.4 as g++ is important to many, whilst ram
size is.  Any pointers were the problems could be?

As an added twist for gcc2.0 debuger try compiling console.c in the kernel
without the -O option.

   ioctl (f, MODE_132x25, TSENG400 );
   I know that what I wrote is in the wrong format. What I just wanted to show
   is that by that way you can select the mode you want just by using the
   right ioctl. 
   I think is a much better solution of the actual one and it will allow to
   prepare the road to port X11.

I agree with your idea.  However, it will require some work.  The reason why
nobody seems interested in doing it is simply because the code as it stands can
use the super VGA BIOS of the machine, since it runs before the OS moves into
protected mode.  After the machine has moved into protected mode, the video
BIOS is useless.  (And if anyone says anything about mapping in the video ROM
in a virtual 8086 process, they deserve to be shot.  It would be more work in
the long run and would make the kernel bigger and slower.)  Unless anyone has/
can get information about super VGA cards, this may come down to tracing what's
happening in the video BIOS, which I may well try at some point.
