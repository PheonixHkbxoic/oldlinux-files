  Cons: 
  - Linux is not as mature as Minix, there is less working software right now.  
  - Linux v0.12 doesn't have real login yet, you are root all the time.  
!     this will change pretty soon probably in the next version (end Feb.)

  - Linux needs 2M of memory just to run, 4M to be useful.  
  - Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message passing.

+ QUESTION: I don't know how to install gcc stuff, is there special places?
+ 
+ ANSWER: It depends on the release of gcc you are using. Right now
+ there are two packages : the original one gccbin.tar.Z contains all
+ the gcc-1.37 binary distrib; and quite recently there is a
+ newgcc.tar.Z which contains the gcc-1.40 stuff. Choose yours
+ 
+ A) gccbin.tar.Z goes in /usr/local/lib except gcc which goes in 
+ /usr/local/bin. Moreover each gcc-xxx of /usr/local/lib should be 
+ linked with gxxx and xxx in /usr/local/bin. 
+ 
+ B) newgcc.tar.Z goes in /usr, then uncompress and untar it. Files are
+ directed to /usr/lib, /usr/include and /usr/bin. You have to link ar,
+ as, ld with gar, gas and gld, this will prevent some error while using

! linux/kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S, then  compile the kernel again.
  
  BTW a Dannish keyboard patch (Tommy Thorn) is now available look the
! digest19 vol#1 file. There is an Uk keyboard too (Jan 25. by Leblanc),
! I have not seen it in the newsgroup so ask directly to
! leblanc@mcc.ac.uk

+ VIII. MORE HINTS
+ ================
+ This part is quite recent and try to keep track of the different
+ information that appeared in alt.os.linux and on the list since
+ beginning of February. I have not checked all of these information.
+ But the one I know correct are marked by a (+). Fill free to contact
+ me and infirm/confirm what is written below. Moreover take care to use
+ the correct library and include stuff for linux-0.12 and the ad-hoc
+ gcc you use !!!
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: How can I backup my Hd under Linux ?
+ 
+ ANSWER: I know at least two ways. One possibility is tar and mtools,
+ another possibility is the diskbackup/diskrestore of Diamano Bolla
+ (digest44 vol. #1) which saves big hd to floppies using the
+ stdin/stdout. 
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: How to use setterm: for the novice?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER:The setterm utility provides access to most of Virtual Consoles
+ (VCs) functionality.  You can set your screen up to blank at 10
+ minutes using:
+               setterm -blank 10
+ 
+ You can set colors, and clear the screen.  For a full list of commands,
+ just type "setterm" with no arguments.
+         
+ There are a few tricks with the screen dumper can really make VCs go a 
+ long way.  Here are a few of the common ones that I use:
+ 
+               setterm dump
+ 
+ Dumps the contents of the current VC to screen.dump (in the current dir).
+                                       
+               setterm dump 4
+                               
+ Dumps the contents of VC 4 to screen.dump
+               
+               setterm -file mydumpfile -dump 4
+ 
+ Dump the contents of VC 4 to the file mydumpfile
+ 
+               setterm -file /dev/tty0 -dump 4
+ 
+ Dumps the contents of VC 4 to the current VC.
+                                       
+               setterm -file /dev/tty4 -dump
+ 
+ Dumps the contents of the current VC to VC 4.
+               
+               setterm -file /dev/tty64 -dump
+                               
+ Dumps the contents of the current VC to the serial port.
+ Handy if you are logged on and want to paste a screen full without
+ having to resort to doing a file transfer.
+ 
+               setterm -file mydumpfile -append 4
+                               
+ Appends to instead of overwriting the dump file.  Useful if you
+ have several screens you wish to concatenate.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: I know there are VC, but where is the setterm stuff?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: It is in virtcons.tar.Z (at least on nic). It provides a
+ number of features that are not available with the standard release of
+ linux-0.12, among them blanking/dumping screen.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: While using emacs in 80x25 mode, the mode line is constantly
+ moving around, why?
+ 
+ ANSWER: This appear to be a bug in the scroll region handling of the
+ console. Some one has suggested to simply remove the last entry in the
+ vt100 termcap that refers to the scroll region escape. Namely remove
+ the cs entry.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: I have read that there are patches for an init/login in
+ Linux-0.12, where can I find them.
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: There are many, one is the qpl-init.tar.Z package available
+ at the 3 main sites, but it is not that good (it's a quick hack). 
+ There is also the Peter Orbaek init/login stuff that can be down-load
+ from ftp.daimi.aau.dk (130.225.16.1); the last version is in the file
+ poeigl-1.1.tar.Z and it is in pub/Linux-source. Among other things it
+ contains a patch to main.c of Linux kernel v0.12 (directory init). You
+ have to recompile the kernel (after patching it) to use /etc/init
+ rather than /etc/rc at boot time.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: How can I change user password in login?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: There is no passwd program yet, you should do it by hand
+ with the encrypt stuff provided.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: When I use make as non root, it doesn't work, why?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: ?????, the message is either (null) setuid ..., or (null)
+ setgid... I don't know how to fix it. 
+ BTW This problem does not exist with the pmake (make for BSD 4.3 Reno
+ and BSD 4.4) package. 
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: How can I get Linux to boot directly from the harddisk?
+ 
+ ANSWER: Right now, this can be done via the shoelace stuff or the
+ bootany package.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: Sometimes, when I want to remove a directory, I get an error
+ message, is it a (known) bug?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: No, There is no bug at all, you probaly have another shell 
+ on another VC whose working directory is either the one you try to 
+ remove, either a subdirectory of it.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: can anyone give me a sample /etc/inittab entry for login
+ from a pc attached to serial line /dev/tty65? 
+ 
+ ANSWER: "Humberto speaking :)"
+ I've got a Hayes Smartmodem 1200 hooked up to /dev/tty65, and log
+ in daily from work. My inittab entry is
+                                  
+           tty65:console:/bin/agetty -m -t 30 1200 tty65
+ 
+ but it works without the -t OK too. The real problem I suspect you're
+ having is initializing the modem properly. Before setting up logins, you
+ have to disable echo and enable auto-answer on the modem. I do this here
+ by firing up kermit at 1200, connecting, then sending 'ate0s0=5'
+ followed by enter to the modem.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: When compiling some code, cc1 complains about some insn
+ code, what's that? 
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: An insn is an internal representation that gcc uses when
+ compiling. The main part of gcc is to take ordinary c (or c++) code,
+ and compile it, while ding optimizations in insn part, which is
+ soft/hard independant. Then another part which is hard/Os dependant
+ takes the insns and translate it in assembly language. The fix is only
+ to turn off the optimization flag (-O) or download the new gcc release
+ (1.4) which has been made available at tsx-11 (newgcc.tar.Z and the
+ ad-hoc libraries newlibc.tar.Z).
+ 
+ BTW I've checked tsx-11 on Sat. 22nd Feb. and nothing is available,
+ but you can find one in /incoming at ftp.eecs.umich.edu.
+ 
+ QUESTION: While compiling some stuff, I'm getting the following 
+ error message:
+ Undefined symbol ___addsf3 referenced from text segment
+ as well as ___mulsf3 and __cmpsf2. 
+ These symbols are not in the program or in it's header files.
+ 
+ ANSWER: These are math helper functions, and you can usually compile
+ these programs to use the kernel floating point routines by adding
+ '-m80387' to the compiler switches. If the program does any wierd 
+ fp math (exp(), sin()) it'll die when you run it though.
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: What are the enhancement of the newgcc.tar.Z ?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: There were some bugs in the old port that have been corrected, 
+ moreover this package contains 387 support 
+ there is libm.a (for those with 387)
+        libsoft.a (for those without, I for example)
+        libtermcap.a (from tput 1.10)
+ 
+ The -mstring-insns option is no longer needed nor supported :( [As
+ an example to recompile (successfully) linux you have to throw away 
+ this flag in all the Makefile]
+ 
+ BTW Notice also that include files have changed (stdio.h which is no 
+ more ansi compliant). Right now (Feb. 24th), there are some little 
+ bugs which will be fixed in a short while.
+ The port of gcc 2.0 has begun ...
+ 
+ 
+ QUESTION: I've been trying to get Linux to run on my [3/4]86 box. It
+ can't even boot. Any suggestions?
+ 
+ (+)ANSWER: The most common error/problem is writing the bootimage to a
+ low density disk. It fits, but the bootstrap code will only recognize
+ high density disk. So try to format explicitely disk as high density:
+ - for 3.5",  'format a: /n:18 /t:80 '
+ - for 5.25", 'format a: /n:15 /t:80 '
+ 
+ QUESTION: Does there exist games, languages (other than C), and
+ anything which make the system more friendly?
+ 
+ ANSWER: Yes, among other things there are rogue and yatzee; TeX;
+ Prolog.. but in general, if you want some extra tool port it to Linux
+ this is also a good beta-testing exercice.
