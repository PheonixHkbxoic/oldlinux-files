at a guess, you are probably running vixie cron or something similar which
attempts to kill it's forked processes but (i believe from a MUCH earlier
posting) the SIGNAL to kill the child process isn't interperted or generated
correctly and the child stops but doesn't release itself from the process
table. (A quick check seems to show that this is true in 0.95 too 8( )

It seems to work :-)
Just a couple of points.

The beast should be in /usr/{bin,lib,man}
not in /usr/local..... 
/usr/local is for site specific software. Nroff is not a site specific
soft.

Another thing is....
Please keep the original names ( where original I mean nroff, pic, tbl )
I understand that gnu can put a g in front of everything they write just to
remembar tht they wrote it but this cofuse a lot not just the user but all
the rest of the programs tht assume that nroff is called nroff and not
groff ( This apply for gcc, gas... but with less importance  )

I proposed earlier that that bit of code should be moved out of there.
My idea is:
Boot linux using default vga.
To select other video modes, features you use an ioctl.
Something like

ioctl (f, MODE_132x25, TSENG400 );
I know that what I wrote is in the wrong format. What I just wanted to show
is that by that way you can select the mode you want just by using the
right ioctl. 
I think is a much better solution of the actual one and it will allow to
prepare the road to port X11.

I really think that .95 should be compiled using the old compiler.
GCC2.0 is in alpha. Something may be broken !!!

I managed to compile the new .95 using the old cc.
Today I am going to set the new device names and then try to run it.
( I already added the recalibrate in floppy.c )

I REALLY would like to increase the file buffer size since my maximum
memory usage is usually 4mb over 5mb so I can give avay 1Mb bor file
buffer!

( I also have swap )

How do I do it ?
Will it be possible to include this thing in config.h ?

It's *not* my decision of course, but I personally would like to see
ash go on the distribution disk, and even to become the /bin/sh
for general use.  It'd be nice to have "make" and "#!/bin/sh scripts"
exec'ing something that much smaller.

Much as I prefer rc's design, I believe ash would be more pragmatic.
And I'll probably keep using bash interactively for a long time, but...

I imagine you could just mkfs a floppy, put the files you want on it,
and then "dd if=/dev/at0 of=rootfloppy bs=32k".

You *might* be able to mkfs a normal file, and mount *it*.  Some systems
allow this, some don't.  I've not tried it on linux.

I changed root to hard disk and have had no problems with HD fs. Even
3 1/2 floppy works most of the time. I'm using mainly mtools, as it
seems slightly more reliable than tarring straight from the floppy.

A couple of other issues came to my mind. First, has anyone plans to
make linux 8 bit clean? If it already is and I haven't noticed, I'm
glad to acknowledge my stupidity. It has been such a struggle to get
the US ASCII users in the mainstream Unix world to notice the eighth
bit that it would be pity if the same painful rigamarole would start
with Linux again. 

Then one question that should find its way to FAQ: how does one use
parallel port and other serial ports than tty64 and tty65? I was
planning to set up a listening modem, and I reckon it should use the
dos com3, as I already have mouse and terminal server cable in the
other ports. If someone has succeeded in using a listening modem with
Linux, I'd be glad to hear about the experiences.

I get similar errors trying to compile basename.c. I'm running 0.95 with
4Mb RAM and 8Mb swap. I don't think basename's that big. Maybe there's a
leak in 0.95?

Yes, it does, actually.  I haven't actually played with it much, since
my first priority was getting it to compile, but it does have shell
functions (which I'm not that familiar with -- I'm used to tcsh and
bash, which both have nice alias capabilities), and many other
features.  It's not quite as feature-heavy as bash, though.  (Read:
you won't see me using it as my interactive shell of choice.  Just
playing with it, I hit the tab key for command/filename completion
too many times.  Almost as bad for my sanity as recompiling the kernel
with the Finnish keyboard!)

I agree with this completely.  It is a small matter to set up ash as
/bin/sh, and have /bin/bash available as well.  If ash is stable enough,
it would be far better as /bin/sh than bash, because of the greatly
reduced size.  It lacks job control, but I can't see how job control
is that useful for a non-interactive shell, anyways.

I haven't tried the first suggestion, which is what I'd assume should be
done, but the second suggestion interested me more:  You can mkfs a file,
but you can't mount it.  Is this a limitation of mount itself, or the
Linux/Minix filesystem?
