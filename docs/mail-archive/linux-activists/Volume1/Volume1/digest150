Hi,

I've applied the alpha patches for 0.95a

Problems:
        rc and ash (but not bash) don't appreciated the patches:
the ctrl-U and <backspace> are postponed until one presses on any
other key. 

examples ll<backspace> : nothing happens
         ll<backspace>s : is "redrawn" as ls


On the other side, ^S and ^Q works like a charm and gdb seems to be okay

Hi,     I'm thinking about setting Linux up and running it as a bbs. I
figured that it would make a quite powerful bbs, allowing the users to
do much more than uploading, downloading files and read news.  I'm 
wondering if anyone has done this before and would give me some suggestions.
I know Linux has bugs, etc. but I believe that it's save enough for nice
users.
        I'm especially interested in ways of setting up "notes" or "news"
etc. on Linux.  I was planning on writing one, but decided to ask around
if there're such programs already for Linux first.
        Any help would be appreciated.

Please email.

Hi,
        I had the same problem when I tried to get the kermit in my system. 
Then I found out that the file was not in 'tar' form.  So I have to 'tar' it
(i.e.  tar cvf kermit.tar kermit) after I uncompress the file kermit.Z.

        Now I have another problem.  How to 'set line' so that I can use the
modem that is connected to serial port #1 ? 

        Thanks in advance.

Fadhil.

Among the file permissions which are not properly set, note that
the root disk sets all devices (including disks and kmem) to rw-rw-rw.
In general, disks (except DOS disks) and memory devices should
only be readable by certain users.  This may mean making, for example,
mtools setgid bin or something.

Mtools as delivered has some detestable code which resets the home
directory to a:\ if it hasn't been accessed in some time.  Is it
perhaps the case that you have not recently typed mcd c:?
Forgive me if this wild guess is too ridiculous.

Has anyone else noticed that the tools/pfdisk.tar.Z on nic.funet.fi
and on all its mirrors is corrupt?  This is a pain, since the
earlier version of pfdisk seemed to have been put together with
files transferred from a DOS system in binary mode, and containing
hundreds of null characters.

I use /dev/ps0, minor 16, for this.  On Minix, the tables were

     dev    x   size drive dsk tr sec
     fdx   0-3   any  any  any any any
     pcx   4-7  5.25  .36  .36 40  9
     atx   8-12 5.25 1.20 1.20 80 15
     qdx  12-15 5.25  .72  .36 40  9
     psx  16-19 3.50  .72  .72 80  9
     patx 20-23 5.25 1.20  .36 40  9
     qhx  24-27 5.25 1.20  .72 80  9
     PSx  28-31 3.50 1.44 1.44 80 18

You'll notice that a few combinations simply do not occur.  In that
case, something similar usually works: e.g., psx for a 720k floppy
in a 1.44mb drive, qdx for a double density 3.5 inch disk in a 1.4mb
drive.  fdx was supposed to be an inefficient way of reading/writing
virtually any floppy, but it often failed in practice.

This sounds like a case of bad permisssions.  /tmp must be rwxrwxrwx
if elvis is to create its temporary files there.

Hi fellow netters!  i've got a BIG problem with Linux, thats probably 
already been covered, but I haven't been paying much attention to the
newsgroup lately.

My 386/25 has 4mb of real memory and i set up a 16mb swap partition
on my drive (as /dev/hdb4) (it seemed to need it. it did.)
and did the 
        mkswap /dev/hdb4 16384
        swapon /dev/hdb4
as shown in the release notes/installation 'guide'....
 
after about 4 hours of use installing lots of programs and rebooting and 
all sorts of natural things to do, it starts giving me:
Out of swap-memory
out of memory
Segmentation Fault
 
mkswap'ping the partition all over again doesn't fix anything.  
 
Why doesn't Linux release memory when it's done with it?!
 
This is linux 0.95 (not a..... haven't gotten 0.95a yet.)
 
Side Question: will Linux 1.0 be released as a complete self-installing 
package like 386bsd?  I vote yes.. :-)

One thing I'd like clarified.  Are we so enamored (sp?) with
'tty' that nothing else can be considered?  After having worked
a while with ISC's 386 UN*X, I've found I like their nameing
convention:  /dev/vt?? for Virtual Terminals, /dev/pt?? for
network psuedo terminals, and /dev/tty?? for real, honest-to-goodness
serial ports.  And yes, /dev/tty automagically gets your output
to you, regardless of which device you are actually using.

Admittedly the number of users on a Linux system (at the moment) is
very close to 1.  However, someday, that will change, and I'd like
to see a naming convention that lends one to easily see how someone
is accessing the machine.

Just a thought.

You don't use the -m switch to getty, do you? Well you shouldn't :-) 
If this is not the problem, then maybe it's just the good old problem with
high bps rates in linux.

On the other hand, getty does try to infer the baud-rate from the login-name.
Have you tried to just hit return or break a couple of times instead of
changing the baud-rate of the terminal.

You are right.

I am considering to replace the init program with a real sysV compatible init
that some guy from the Netherlands (forgot his name) wrote for minix.

That should fix that problem...

When the new libc is stable and source is released I will release the new and
improved version as poeigl-1.3.
