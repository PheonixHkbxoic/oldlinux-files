Date: 25 Jan 92 05:00:59 GMT

If you're into hardware hacking, you can rig a pc to boot from drive B in a
kind of painless fashion.  The pc world tells its A drives from its B drives
not by means of the drive select jumpers on the drives (in fact, some drives
no longer even *have* the jumpers, which is a sore blow to a cp/m wizard like
me :-) ) but by means of that infernal twist in the floppy drive cable.  Both
floppies are jumped as DS1, and the twist in the cable lets the pc do drive
select and motor on at the same time.  The cable goes 

controller ---- drive B ---(twist)--- drive A

What you need to do is get a 4 pole double throw switch.  Pick out the lines 
in the ribbon cable (lines 10-16, I think) and carefully figure out which lines
have the signals and which are grounds (you don't need to switch the grounds).
*VERY* carefully separate these lines from the ribbon and splice the switch in,
wired up as a "reversing switch", something like this:

 from controller 10   -------o o-----  10  to drive B  ====x==== to drive A
                              X 
                 16   -------o o-----  16

                 12   -------o o-----  12
                              X
                 14   -------o o-----  14          
                (back view of 4pdt switch)

Flipping the switch has the effect of adding another twist to the cable, which
will reverse the effect of the twist between the drives, making the former B
drive to now be the A drive, and vice verse.  

WARNING:  This technique *should* work, although now that I think about it,
it'll blow the mind of your AT's cmos setup; you'll likely have to run the
setup utility (hopefully, it's in rom) to inform the BIOS that the drives have
been flopped.  If you are the least bit unsure about doing this mod, get a
new floppy drive cable and perform the modification on *it*.  That way, if my
harebrained scheme doesn't work, you can have the original cable to fall back
on.

After installing the new floppy driver I have a different sort of
problem...  The machine reboots when I try to write to a floppy !?!?
The machine is an Epson NB3s laptop...  I haven't had enough time
yet to see if I could figure out why, just reporting the symptoms...

The answer is R.T.F.M :-).  This info is in docs/INSTALL-0.11 :

As with harddisk, floppies have device numbers, but this time major = 2
instead of 3. The minor number is not as easy: it's a composite that
tells which drive (A, B, C or D) and what type of drive (360kB, 1.2M,
1.44M etc). The formula is 'minor = type*4+nr', where nr is 0-3 for A-D,
and type is 2 for 1.2M disks, and 7 for 1.44M disks. There are other
types, but these should suffice for now.

Thus if you have a 1.2M A-drive, and want to call it "floppy0", you have
to tell linux so. This is done with the "mknod" command. mknod takes 4
paramters: the unix name of the device, a "b" or a "c" depending on
whether it's a Block of Character device, and the major and minor
numbers. Thus to make "floppy0" a 1.2M A-drive, you write:

    mknod /dev/floppy0 b 2 8

b is for Block-device, the 2 is for floppy, and the 8 is 4*2+0, where
the 2 is 1.2M-drive and the 0 is drive A. Likewise to make a "floppy1"
device that is a 1.44M drive in B, you write:
 
    mknod /dev/floppy1 b 2 29
 
where 29 = 4*7 + 1.  There are a couple of standard names, for users
that are used to minix (major, minor in parentheses): /dev/PS0 is a
1.44M in A (2,28), /dev/PS1 a 1.44M in B (2,29), /dev/at0 is a 1.2M in A
(2,8), /dev/at1 is a 1.2M in B (2,9). Use mknod to make those that fit
your computer.
 
After you have made these special block devices, you can now read a
floppy under linux. The easiest way to import things into linux is by
writing a tar-file to a floppy with rawrite.exe, and then using:

Yes.  This is bad, but not /that/ bad: linux only swaps /dirty/ pages: I
doubt the GNU emacs eceutable pages get dirtied, and are thus just
reloaded by the demand-loading mechanism (and nothing happens at the
fork()).  But yes, when editing big files (where there are a lot of
dirty pages) will force a swap-in. 

Swapping was added as a quick hack: it wasn't really meant to extend
virtual memory to really big values - more just to get gcc working on a
2M machine, and have that small extra memory when your executables don't
quite fit. More like a temporary "panic-memory": it linux swaps on a
more regular basis the algorithms should be changed to something better
as well, they are rudimentary right now..

This sounds very workable.  You can leave your first hard drive alone if
you are willing to boot from a floppy disk when you wish to run Linux.
/dev/hd1 - /dev/hd4 are the partitions on the first hard drive, /dev/hd6 -
/dev/hd9 are on the 2nd.  Make 2 or 3 partitions on the 2nd drive, one for
your main Linux area, one for a root Linux partition, and possibly one for
swap space.  Then edit the boot image to use these areas and write it to a
floppy for booting. (please read the installation instructions first)

Boot without a floppy for MSDOS, with the floppy for Linux.

BTW, 80 meg of disk space should be fine, at least until somebody gets X11r5
ported...

Patch is pretty smart about doing the patches, if the patches are what is
called 'context diffs' (cdiffs).  For ordinary diffs, it is more difficult
to get them to work when the starting files are not as expected.  Often this
means it is time to do hand editing.

The fd 'patch' is made of complete replacement and new files, you simply put
them in the right places and recompile.  The lp patch uses ordinary diffs,
and at least on my system, required hand editing to work.  (comment out 2
references to a non-existing include file and fix a makefile)  I can't tell
you about the login patch, but I did the other two last night, and they
don't interfere with each other.

Hi Linuxers!

My site recieved alt.os.linux since yesterday and the messages are
dated from 19th Jan. :), so I follow the discussion on
alt.os.linux only via the digests (Hope this will end in 1 or 2 weeks).

I plan to post the FAQ at the end of the 1st week of each month in two
ways.
1) in Cdiff form (not before marsh 'cause the FAQ is not stable at all
and the Cdiff is twice bigger than the whole)
2) in whole form especially for new incomers.

And also the Cdiff updated, one or two weeks after each new version of
Linux is available.

Please suggest any change, rephrasing, deletions, new questions,
answers ...  
Please include "FAQ" in the subject of messages sent to /me/ about
FAQ, not to the newsgroup since right now I get ONLY digests.  
Please use corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr whatever will be the From part 
of this message.

Bug or feature?  I'm not sure, but the kind of behavior you're refering
to I can emulate with the Bourne shell in SunOS 3.5 ...  So it must be

Reply-To: mont@netcom.netcom.com (Mont Pierce)

I use the tar that came with linux and have no problems backing up
to multiple volumes.  You do have to specify the right options:

    tar -ML 1440 -cvf /dev/fd0 [filenames]

    -M = multiple volumes
    -L = volume length is 1440 blocks

Type " tar + help" to get a full list of options.  The "-b" option comment
is wrong though.  It says "-b n  block size is n*512 (defualt n=20)", 
default n is really 2 not 20.

Only problem I've noticed is that if I use the "-z" option it doesn't 
seem to save any data on the diskette.  I've tested this by doing the
following:

    tar -ML 1440 -zcvf tarfile [filenames]

When the tar command prompts for the next diskette I switched to another 
window to look at the size of the "tarfile".  The tar file was smaller
then 1474560 bytes.  This indicates that tar reads the same amount of data
whether or not compressing the output.  So using compress or not to do 
backups to diskette doesn't matter.  I had hoped that it would stuff more
data onto each diskette and thus use less diskettes.  Oh well.

As an aside, I often wonder what people with IDE drives do in these
situations.  The ability to low-level format a drive is often a boon,
when you really want to start over from scratch.  That's why my motto is
"MFM forever!".

But seriously, folks, there must be some kind of util that does
everything except the actual physical low-level formatting, for IDE
(& perhaps other non-formattable) drives.

I now got Linux running on my 386SX computer with 4 Mbyte memory, it seems
to work just fine.

However I have a couple of questions:

I have 3 serial ports on my computer (internal modem, mouse, and to another
computer) which I use when I am running MS-DOS on it (bad habit :-).
I dont't want to reconfiguring the hardware every time I want to use modem
etc in Linux. Does the driver supports COM3 and COM4 ? Or has one to change
the kernel ?


When I tried to uncompress a 500k file a got "out of memory" (or 
something like that) message. is this normal ? I have no swap space.
