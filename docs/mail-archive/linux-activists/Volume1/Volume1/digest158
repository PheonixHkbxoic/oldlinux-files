Well I see a trend concerning DTK motherboards.  We at Yarc have also had 
our shar of problems with DTK mother boards.  I beleive this also concerned
running I/O at high speeds.  You should be able to draw your own conclusions
at this point. DON'T RUN LINUX (or anything else for that matter) ON DTK.
We did do a little investigation into the problem (we thought it was our fault)
and discovered that the only motherboard in the world we had the problem with
was (low and behold) DTK.

I don't know why it wouldn't work for you when it does for me. Well,
maybe the mapping is implemented in a different way. I have a Magtron
ESDI disk with 1600 cylinders, 4 heads and 35 sectors. The controller
says it has 223 cyls, 16 heads and somewhere over 60 sectors and linux
hasn't had anything to complain about that.

The real problem is that you currently can't use more than four 64 M
partitions on the disk, so you are limited to 256 megs disk space
anyway. I suppose that is going to change rather soon, though, as
there are dozens of excellent hackers doing all kinds of nice
improvements on linux. BTW, thanks to all of them!

   However, the sentiments of many people working on Linux are
   understandably quite different. They get no financial benefits out of
   Linux and are working on it for fun and because it's a worthwhile
   project. If all you intend to do is provide a service and make a little
   money on the side then that's in this spirit. However, when you say
   things like, "can I make a living out of this" and the such like then
   their reaction is, not surprisingly, "why should I give my free time so
   that someone else can get rich". This is basically exploitation of others
   good intentions.

Hmm... well, my reaction is that it doesn't make any difference if
someone tries to make a buck off of Linux, since the GPL states that
when something is distributed under the GPL, (1) the GPL must included
as part of the distribution, in an obvious place, and (2) either the
source must be included or a pointer to a place where the source can be
made freely available.  So anyone who gets pays $1000 for Linux will be
immediately treated to the obvious fact that they can give it away to
anybody they want.  I find it very doubtful that anyone would be able to
"make a living out of this" under these circumstances.

Also, if there are really stupid people out there paying $1000/copy for
Linux, you can be sure that I and several other people will immediately
go out there and offer to sell copies of Linux for $500/copy, and then
$100/copy, and then $20/copy..... and pretty soon the free market will
take care of driving the price to "natural" levels.

I really don't see the big deal and fuss.... the GPL is designed so no
one will be able to make outrageous amounts of money over the mere
distribution of the software.  Support?  That's a different matter; but
if you are selling support, (like Cygnus), you need to put in a lot more
effort yourself --- it's not like you're just mooching off the efforts
of other people.

I have only one drive.  I believe I mentioned in my original posting
that I made no guarantees if you have more than one.  Linus says my
patches broke support for two drives.  I've got his version, which
might work for you, but I'm reluctant to post patches that Linus sent
me via email.  Based on past performance I'd expect Linus would have
an official version that supports extended partitions fairly soon.

On looking back at my patch, I do see a problem with multiple drives.
Since I only have one, I can't test it with more than one.  But I
believe my code

        current_minor += 4;  /* first "extra" minor */
        if (*(unsigned short *) (bh->b_data+510) == 0xAA55) {
                p = 0x1BE + (void *)bh->b_data;
                for (i=1 ; i<=4 ; i++,p++) {

should probably be changed to

        i = current_minor & 0xff;
        current_minor += 4;  /* first "extra" minor */
        if (*(unsigned short *) (bh->b_data+510) == 0xAA55) {
                int n;
                p = 0x1BE + (void *)bh->b_data;
                for (n=1 ; n<=4 ; i++,n++,p++) {

This isn't the most elegant solution, but is the one involving the
fewest changes.  The best solution involve a change in variable
names, to something like

  i --> minor
  current_minor --> next_minor

If this change works please tell me and I'll update my archived copy
of the diffs.  I have no way to test it myself.

This is what happens if you use the /dev/PS0 device (ie "b 2 28") - to
read a 720kB floppy you have to use anuther device number: linux doesn't
try to find out what kind of floppy you are using (which seems to be
relatively standard unix practice). Use /dev/ps0 ("b 2 16")

Minor number for floppies are as follows (should be in the FAQ):

nr+4*type, where nr = 0,1,2,3 for A,B etc floppy
type:
1 - 360kB floppy in 360kB drive
2 - 1.2M floppy in 1.2M drive
3 - 360kB floppy in 3.5" drive
4 - 720kB floppy in 3.5" drive
5 - 360kN floppy in 1.2M drive
6 - 720kB floppy in 1.2M drive
7 - 1.44M floppy in 3.5" drive

Ok, I was lazy: I use "-Wall" for gcc which gives warnings for most
everything, and I didn't correct quite all the warnings. They are easy
to correct, or you can remove the -Wall flag :)

Hedrick's patches break with more than one drive: he had only one drive
to test on.  I'll make a new alpha-patch available which should fix most
problems (including this), but it won't be until next week.

It doesn't even try right now: I don't know in what format the core-file
should be anyway etc..  I might implement it if somebody tells me what
format gdb expects, or I'll accept patches (the stubs are there already,
but the actual core-dumping isn't).

Ok, at least the 0.95(a) kernel supports it: I haven't tested it out,
but the reboot system call should be able to reboot the machine, so
automatic shutdown isn't that difficult any more.  Anybody interested in
writing one? Note that the reboot system call needs a lot of magic
numbers (I didn't want any accidental reboots), and can also
disable/enable the three-finger-salute for people who don't like it.

Is C-A-D "unreliable" for anyone else?  For me, sometimes the machine
reboots, sometime the system merely hangs.  This is no biggie right now,
but it interfere with a complete shutdown implementation. 

I noticed some changes to reset_now (?) in .95a wrt .12.  Know what the
significance of them are?

Well, from my experiences with various flavors of Unix, i've grown to 
like my own naming scheme. (Everyone's gotta have their own). I use these
whenever I build device names.
tty01, tty02,...,ttyXX  for consoles, local terminals, and the like.
        (I.E. Anything thats directly connected to the system)
ttyM01, ttyM02, ...ttyMXX for modems, remote terminals, etc, and so forth.
ttyP01, ttyP02,...ttyPXX for psuedo-terminals (or pty01, pty02...)
ttyL01, ttyL02,...ttyLXX for printers and other ouput devices.

I'm odd.. I don't want the device name to tell me what it refers to in the
hardware; I only need to know that during installation. I want the device
names to tell me what the device is DOING for me.

Subject: more problems with mkfs 0.95a
Date: 25 Mar 92 23:27:02 GMT

Well, since it has been a slow day and I have been frustrated at
trying to get version 0.95a up and running, I decided to try an
experiment.  (All of this has happened since my last post).  First, I
found the post by Iain Reid and followed it to the letter.  No luck,
0.95a still would not mkfs on my d: drive.

Since that didn't work, I retreived the 0.12 images, booted under
that, and created a file system on my d: drive.  No problems at all
were encountered.  So, I now have a working 0.12 linux system.  Then,
I rebooted using the 0.95a bootimage and rootimage.  This is a literal
transcription of what occurred:

        <After Loading........ etc. and SVGA prompt>

rebooted from my 0.12 bootimage disk and, lo and behold, I have a
working filesytem on /dev/hd6 (which, if I am not mistaken is the same
as /dev/hdb1).

As I mentioned before, the disk I am trying to install to is a Seagate
ST251-1 IDE drive (~40M).  Running Norton disk test on it reveals no
errors, it has worked fine as a DOS disk for 2 years, it is currently
working fine as a linux 0.12 disk, BUT linux 0.95a seems to want
nothing to do with it.  What gives???

As before, any help will be greatly appreciated.  I'm at a complete
loss here.

Thanks,

Is anyone working on support for Adaptec SCSI controllers? Particularly

Hi,

I am the guy who ported gcc 2.0 to Linux. During the porting, I
rearranged the libc.a. I included glibc.a, libg++.a and some functions
from poeigl-1.2. The libc.a come with gcc 2.0 is almost totally new.
The shared libraries are also in gcc 2.0.

Gcc 2.0 is now in the very late alpha testing. There are some bugs in
libc.a. I hope the number of bugs can be reduced to a tolerable level
after the alpha testing. After that, I will release all the source
codes for libc.a and patches for gcc 2.0. I have submitted my patches
for gcc 2.0. I hope it will be in gcc 2.1. It may be too late for that.

If you want to test gcc 2.0, please drop me a note. Be prepared to ftp
a new release every one or two days, even twice a day. That is what
happened during the early stage of the alpha testing. Now it is quite
stable.

I am enclosing the part of FAQ for 2.0.

I just got gcc 2.1. The next testing release may be 2.1.


H.J.
===========FAQ=============
QUESTION: What are the main differences with the old release?

ANSWER: Here are the features.

1. gcc and g++ are in one.

2. ANSI and BSD 4.4 compatible stdio.

3. iostream for g++. It has

* Full implementation of ANSI C stdio.
* Full implementation of the streambuf layer of AT&T's
  iostream library for C++.
* Full compatibility between stdio and streambufs.

and libg++.a 2.0.

4. Libc.a is almost new. Most of glibc.a 1.02 (nonnetwork stuffs) are 
here.

        a. ctype
        b. grp
        c. locale
        d. posix
        e. pwd
        f. stdlib
        g. string
        h. time (untested)

Some other functions are added.

        b. cvt
        b. drand48
        c. getlogin (poeigl-1.2)
        d. getpass (poeigl-1.2)
        e. mkfifo (is that supported in kernel?)
        f. regex (GNU)
        g. ufc
        h. utmp stuffs (poeigl-1.2)

These old functions are not changed very much.

        a. soft math (fmod is added)
        b. math (some are new)
        c. termcap
        d. unistd

5. The shared libraries are here. To link with the static libraries,
add the -static flag to gcc.

QUESTION: Is stdio ANSI compatible?

ANSWER: Yes, please test it.

QUESTION: Is g++ in 2.0?

ANSWER: Yes. Use g++ to compile the C++ code. Libg++.a 2.0 is here.
Only thing missing is curses since I don't have it. I am going to run
the tests. For the beta version of libg++.a 2.0, the only test not
passed is tFix24.

QUESTION: What options can I use for gcc?

ANSWER: Read manual page, gcc.ps or gcc.man. -O3, -O4, -O5 or even
higher should work with 2.0. -O3 is said to be the best. Don't ask me
why. Try it yourself. Also -static tells gcc to use the static
libraries. The default is the shared libraries.

QUESTION: Where is the source code of the new libc.a?

ANSWER: I will release the source code at least after the alpha test is
finished. Please test it as much as possible.
