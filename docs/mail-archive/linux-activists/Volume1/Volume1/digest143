Something posted in an earlier message suggested that Linux doesn't
allow filenames larger than 14 characters.  Is this true?  Is this going
to be fixed?

I belive most modern unices (BSD4, SCO UNIX, and I think the newest AT&T
versions) allow up to 256 or so characters.  It would seem to me that a
new unix clone (such as linux) should support this from ground floor
rather than having to upgrade later.

hi-
        i've noticed a small problem with agetty [i posted this to
linux-activists@fi, but haven't seen it; but our mail/net is jumbled now].

1) i have an esprit terminal connected off my serial line that i'd like to
   run at 19200 baud. when i set the correct line in inittab, the login
   program seems to be executing at the wrong speed, 9600 baud. when i switch
   the terminal to 9600 baud, i get the login, but after logging in the
   terminal goes back to 19200 baud. i'm forced to run everything at 9600 baud.
   is there another file to specify the login speed?

2) this same connection is also used to drive my modem at 2400 baud. to turn
   off the login on the terminal i comment out the line in inittab, then use
   kill -1 1. this works, but won't kill the current login process. if i
   enter in some dummy name, the process will go away after the failed login.

Hmmm, does a 'rm swap-file-name' works ?

You obviousually have to cut the call to swapon from your rc.

If you have a swap partition, well just make an fdisk on it.

It's quite simple, using no options you link your applications with
shared libs, using -static you link with normal libs. Beware not to
clean your objects, since gcc-2.0 is still a beta it is supposed to
change, at least shared libs are supposed to change, and your
executable maybe unable to find right objs in the new libs.

Your program will probably work, but it shouldn't.  I wrote a similar program
last night.  It will be fine for resetting the device numbers to 0 for
making Linux use the floopy drive for root, but if you just booted Linux
for the first time and you have your floppy drive mounted as root, you really
shouldn't take the root floppy out to put the boot image in.  But maybe you
have a solution to this problem that I didn't think of?

Subject: Top
Date: 24 Mar 92 13:58:17 GMT

I have uploaded top to tsx.  It is a bastardisation of ps.  Below is
the readme:

Top
===

Disclaimer:

It works on my system.
Linux 0.95a 33MHz 386 IDE hard drive 4MB ram
GCC 1.40 (the new one)

Prerequisites:

ps by Branko Lankester
termcap functions (tgetent, tgetstr, tgoto etc)

Description:

This is top, inspired by the real world top.  It is based on ps by Branko
Lankester (I used ps095.tar.Z).  It displays the 'top' system processes, 
either by cpu use or memory use.

There are 24 fields that can be displayed for each process.  These are copies 
of the fields that ps would display.  You can select which fields you want
displayed or not.  Top can save this (to ~/.toprc) and will use it the next
time you run top.

The interval for update can be changed from zero to nine seconds.

Top displays a line giving help for keys.  Longer descriptions:

q       quit
k       kill - send any process a signal
n       nice - nice the top process (the code would allow changes to other
        processes's nice value, but there is no system kill)
c       sort processes by cpu usage
m       sort processes by memory usage
0 to 9  change update delay (in seconds)
A to X  toggle display of field
ctrl-W  write update delay, which fields are displayed to .toprc
        top reads this file on startup  
        
Installing:

Unpack top to the same directory as ps.  To compile:
cc -O -DNO_UPDATE -o top top.c psdata.c topcmd.c -ltermcap

Bugs/Notes:

Setting update delay to zero slows the machine to a crawl.  It is really good 
for wathcing executables being demand paged in.

The code for calculating all the fields is lifted straight from ps.c.

The keyboard response is jerky.  I tried using select, but it didn't work.  
Instead, it does a keyboard read every second.

Comments and bug reports for ps to:   lankeste@fwi.uva.nl (Branko Lankester)

For top, you'll have to sort it out yourself.  I probably won't have access to
a linux system for the next six months, starting friday 27 march.  I will
still respond by email, but can't do anything about it.  Hopefully Branko
can incorporate it back into ps.

My email address is cs89rdb@brunel.ac.uk (Roger Binns).

Ok: I didn't comment before, as I hadn't much to say, and I'll just make
my standpoint clear here once and for all, as people seem to be
wondering. 

I feel that if David is serious and willing to take on anything like
what he suggested, it certainly can't hurt anyone.  If people are
willing to pay for David's services, it means they are wanted, and he
shouldn't be discouraged.  What he proposed is certainly allowed by the
copyright, and I think some of the reactions were a bit harsh. 

Naturally, I'd feel even happier if /I/ got all the money off this
enterprise, but on the other hand, I wouldn't want to bother with all
the distribution problems etc, so I have only myself to blame (*).  If
somebody wants to make the same services available as David, I'll be
happy, but I don't feel it's a good idea to try to undercut David just
because of a I-wrote-parts-of-it-why-should-David-get-the-money?
sentiment. 

I can't say I made any "sacrifice" in writing linux and making it freely
distributable: I enjoyed most of it (bug-reports aren't fun, and I
/hate/ hardware-dependent bugs, but they are interesting), and I got out
as much as I gave (if I hadn't made it public, I'd probably never had
implemented some features I now think are indispensable).  Also, most
persons sent me diffs well aware of the copyright: admittedly it changed
between versions 0.11 and 0.12, but I made it clear at the time, and
nobody minded it then. 

I hope David makes it clear to potential customers what linux is and
that it is available for free if you want to take the trouble to find it
and set it up - his service would be just that: a service.  If people
find it worth the money, then everything is fine.  The amount of money
he makes is irrelevant.

                Linus

(*) I also didn't want to make linux "guilt-ware", so I have even tried
to avoid asking for voluntary donations.  Sometimes I'm too stupid for
my own good.

Interesting... the 2200sx I tried it (.95a) on barfed... kernel panic,
couldn't mount root ... after a few reset-floppy's.

Yes... it uses part of the HD as a 'swap space'.  I believe it is actually
mrely having a small partition for swapping.  Most Linuxers would wipe it
out, I think...
I base this on the fact that if you run standard DOS 'fdisk' to delete all
the partitions, and recreate them, resume doesn't work.  However, if you
use the Toshiba DOS 'fdisk' everything goes o.k.

No. Toshiba and Zenith, for example, use -completely- different schemes to
implement this... I haven't seen the guts of enough SL machines to know
about _them_...

Hm.  Usually, they use a custom BIOS call.  (Back to the DOS emulator
question! :-)  The custom BIOS is "normally" (we -are- talking notebook,
here)  ..."normally"  where the extra code is held.

   This brings up something I've been meaning to ask.  Are you (or anyone

   possibly even fully patched set of sources.  I'm mostly thinking about
   bug-fixes here but we might want to also include an alternate set of

   may not be included (at Linus' discretion) in the next release.

   What I'm hoping to avoid is the "patch anxiety" experienced by users
   like me who get a bit antsy when their kernel reaches a certain level
   of patches.  I remember when the patches to 0.12 started to overlap.
   They appeared to work but I didn't feel very secure.

In the patches.doc (or something like that :-) file I have on tsx-11,
I try to say a little bit about the status of the patches.  I will

them, right or wrong.

I have written a small DOS program called 'setroot.exe' that allows to set
the major/minor boot device in the root floppy. Because it is a DOS program,
it is an alternative to using NU. If there is demand for setroot, I can
post it. I always thought there must be such a tool already - if it isn't,
shouldn't it be included with a standard distribution? I think many
non-hacker users don't like poking around in their diskette's boot sectors.
