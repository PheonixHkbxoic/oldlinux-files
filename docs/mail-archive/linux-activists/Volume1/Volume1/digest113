Hello !
This weekend I spent some time to test linux :-)
I found some "strange" things and I am posting it here hoping that more
people will start hunting for problems. The idea is that if there are
problems it is better to solve them now than later.

1) How to increase the file buffer area.
   This is an answer from Linux and it works.
   In linux/init/main.c look at the function start_kernel. In there there
   is a sequence of if (MAX memory) > .... then buffer_memory_ent =
   something; Well you just have to change the buffer_memory_end to a value
   that sit to you. Linux raccomend to leave the boundaries intact.
   Ex: if the buffer_memory_end is 3*512*1024 it may be wise to change it
   to 4*512*1024 :-)
   BTW: I would like this kind of things in config.h togheter with all
   other installabele stuff. Something like:
   #define BUFFER_MEMORY=value
   #define RAMDISK      /* Compile the ramdisk support          */
   #define PRINTER      /* Compiler prineter support            */
   #define SCSI         /* Compile SCSI support                 */
   #define INET         /* Compile TCP-IP support               */
   #define IPC          /* Compile shar-mem, semaphores..       */
   #define HAVETSENG    /* If you have a tseng VGA              */
   And so on.... 
   Seems reasonable and will avoid a lot of the patching business..

2) Ftp servers support.
   I understand that the ftp administrator is VERY buisy. For this reason
   my previous suggestion to organize the linux tree as a set of sobtree
   one for each release was aimed to REDUCE the work of the sysadmin and
   increase the clarity of the system.
   The idea is that the administrator create one subtree for each release
   and put into the subtrees ONLY new software. DO NOT move soft around. DO
   NOT create symlinks to previous version of software. DO NOT rename old
   version to avoid naming conflict.
   Ex: New INSTALL software for the .95a is release. This goes under the
   linux.95a subtree under the install subdirectory. The sysadmin DO NOT
   worry about what soft is compatible with or if there is no cc under
   .95a. The idea is that the user will browse trought the old releases and
   pich up what he needs. By this way the problem of name conflict is
   eliminated. ( cc is called cc in all subtrees and if you want the latest
   you just go in the latest release ( if there is one cc in the latest
   release)). It seems easier and clearer to me. Am I still tryng to make
   other people working more ?

3) Now the testing. Testing malloc.
   I have 5mb of ram and 6Mb of swap space. It appears that malloc does not
   care of how much ram or swap I have and always return a pointer != NULL.
   ALso tryng to assign a null value to the newly allocated area works in
   the sense that id does NOT memory fault or kill the process. 
   To try this just 
   p= (char *)malloc (40mb );
   for (i=0; i<40mb; i++)
      *P++ = 0;
   
   I applied the "patches" to swap.c that appeared some articles ago. It
   does not change much still there are problems. 
   The system become a bit hung when the loop start tryng to touch non
   existent space and messages like no more swap appears ( but the process
   is still running ). It would be nice if other people try to play with
   malloc and report the results.

4) More testing. vi with a huge file
   A possibly related problem is tryng to edit a huge file ( 7mb ). 
   the distributed vi just say that it has an error reading back the
   temporary file. Again I did some testing with the patched kernel in
   swap.c but there is not much difference apart thet the problem tahe
   longer to appear.

5) Testing tar.
   With all this testing I tryed to use tar to backup....
   I am tryng to use the multivolume option. Something like
   tar -cvMV "test" -zf /dev/PS0 -L xxx .
   The problem is that tar report "broken pipe" someway at the end of the
   first disk. It may well be that I am doing something wrong but I think
   not ... :-) Anyway. In doing the tar some messages appears in the
   terminal of the type:
   Unespected Hd Intr
   And the console blink ( possible interaction between console code and
   floppy interrups and hd ? )

6) Testing pipes and disks.
   Since tar does not seems to work I then resorted to the simple backup
   program I wrote. It also says broken pipe.....
   Ex: tryng to do a 
   tar -cf - . | compress | diskbachup "test"
   Result in a broken pipe. I am not really shure of where the problem
   lyes. I just would like to know if the write to the floppy devices MUST
   be of a fixed size ( a multiple of some number ) since the device is a
   block one or I can do write of different size. 
   Probably by today I will have the answer anyway since I am going to try
   but it would be nice to know anyway :-)

7) Small consideration.
   It would be nice if /unix is present in the / directory. The fact is
   that it is a bit odd to have a special database to know the symbol
   address of the kernel. If /unix is present in / then you can use nlist
   to find out where the stuff in the kernel is and get it by /dev/kmem.
   It is not complicated. It is just changing the linux Makefile so it has
   something like
   unix: same dependency list of tools/system
        cc -nostdlib \
        same objects list of tools/system
        -o /unix

8) For all of you that don't know yet...
   You can have a kind of ps by pressing the scroll-lock button...
   and a kind of memory status by pressinf CTRL-SHIFT-SCROLLOCK
   BTW: During my malloc testing i saw that at some point the shared pages
   figure went to 0 instead of the 50 or more that used to be.
   Also after having press many ctrl-c in the offending process and vaited
   for some 2-3 minutes the process eventually died BUT the kernel
   complained with some child-without-parent message.
   I am going to try again today sometime. I am also going to take more
   note of the test I am doing :-)

9) Consideration....
   I received a nice letter from the person that ported the groff.
   He is sayng that since groff is not really an nroff it should be in
   /usr/local .... 
   It is true that groff is not really a simple nroff. It is true that gcc
   is not really a cc. It is true that most utilityes are not really the
   same that you can find in a sparc or an HP or ......
   BUT since they are the only one we have WHY do we put them in /usr/local
   I really think that the distribution MUST NOT use /usr/local and that
   the names of the executables MUST be as close as possible to the
   "common" naming conventions. We don't want to create a "babele" of
   names, don't we ?

Linux is turning into a classic medium-to-large-scale programming project,
with all the problems that entails.  I'd like to make a plea for the use
of RCS on the kernel sources to help keep these problems in check.  Briefly,
some of the benefits would be:

1. One can tell at a glance the version number of each file.
2. Changes become self-documenting (well, partly!): the programmer has to
   enter a log message when each new revision is checked in, and this
   gives us a visible history of changes, who made them, and why.
3. Undoing changes becomes easier: it's possible, if necessary, to
   backtrack to any earlier revision.
4. Merging one's own modifications with a later release becomes easier.

Personally, I'd like to see the kernel completely RCS-ised by version 1.0.
What do other people think?

Date: Mon, 16 Mar 92 13:09:17 GMT

Hello.

  I'm very interested in trying out Linux.  I obtained the root and boot images for both 0.12 and 0.95.  Made my diskettes, and tried it out.  I didn't get as far as I thought I would though!

  One of the first instructions says to check the hardware requirements.  Okay, as I understand that, that means 386, AT-bus, AT-hard drive.  I have a PS/2 Mod 70.  Am I totally out of luck?  I thought that maybe I would at least be able to get the floppy root up, but I only get as far as the boot diskette telling me I have 8 virtual consoles and 4 pty's.  Then it just sits there.

  One other note:  I only have a VGA, yet the boot diskette asks me to select an SVGA mode.  I hit a key other than return hoping that it will default to some VGA mode, however.

  The same thing basically happens whether I boot 0.12 or 0.95, except that I get one error message about queues on 0.12 and the screen clears on 0.95.

  I suspect (unfortunately), that I am disqualified immediately because I have a PS/2 with MicroChannel.  Am I right?

  Thanks,

Date: 16 Mar 92 14:05:10 GMT

This probably isn't a great question since Linux is a hackers OS and Messy-dog
isn't, but are we ever likely to see a DOS emulator of some form running under
Linux?  The machine i'm playing with linux on in the wee hours of the night
also runs a BBS system under MS-DOS by day.  None of my other machines run
MS-DOS, emulated or otherwise.   I think Linux is an *excellent* hack.. 
great work, Linus...  keep up the good work...  now if it only had a DOS
emulator, I wouldn't be forced to play with it in the middle of the night.

To keep demand page loading you want to compress on each n*4k byte
boundary. The larger n is the more memory required fora page fault,
but there should be fewer page faults. The big disadvantage is that this is
a kernel mod.

Another way is to create a shell script that checks for the appropriate
binary. If it's not there it uncompresses the compressed version,
executes it and then removes it.

Here would be a sample script
#!/bin/sh
if [ -f /comp/bin/<command> ]; then
/comp/bin/<command>; else
uncompress /comp/bin/<command>.Z; /comp/bin/<command>; rm /comp/bin/<command>
fi

A few commands like sh, rm, and  compress shouldn't be compressed.

Hi:

  I saw a posting some time ago indicating that some one is trying to port
dvips. Does this mean somebody else has ported TeX? A even better question:
Has any body ported TeX? If so, may I know how I can get it?

Let me get greedy here: If the port of TeX is already complete, is there
any one who has done a port of programs that print dvi files on dot-matrix
printers? Again, can I have it if it is ready?

Subject: misc. questions
Date: 16 Mar 92 16:21:26 GMT

Now that I got Linux 0.12 up and running on my harddrive, I am all exited :-)
Time for some questions:

- Downloaded newgcc.tar.Z (from nic.funet.fi). "limits.h" was not found
  in the include directory. I had to fetch "include.tar.Z". Is this
  what I am supposed to do ?

- Installed kermit and pcomm. I am able to dial/connect to my host with
  pcomm, but when I hit a key the screen just went blank.
  I am still in pcomm though (since ^A-h displays the help menu)
  How do I "talk" to COM1 ?
  Is tty64 and tty65 assigned as COM1 & COM2 respectively ?

- Trying to compile "mtools" to recognize 720K and 360K disk. 
  I have to create the proper devices first.
  How do I calculate minor numbers for 720K and 360K disks ?
  minor = type * 4 + nr
  INSTALL-0.11 only tells "type" for 1.2 Meg (2) and 1.44 Meg (7) disks.

- What should I do when the 0.95a is out ? Can I still keep the configuration
  that I have on my harddisk (ie only modify some of the files such as
  /etc/rc, ... etc. :-). How difficult it would be to upgrade to 0.95a ?
  If I have to do major things on my harddisk, I'd wait installing things
  until 0.95a is out.

- I am still using 80x25 screen. Somehow 0.12 boot disk doesn't let me
  choose the screen, just straight asking to insert the root floppy or
  just straight to the harddisk in this case. 0.95 boot disk let me choose
  a bigger screen (smaller font). 

Sorry if the question is in the FAQ (is there a FAQ ?)

thanks

It works for me.  It's pretty easy to check out the previous version
of something if you break it.  

Also, RCS only keeps diffs between different versions, and will use less disk 
space than keeping a backup copy of everything.

Well, don't forget we already have pfdisk, and I have been able to fit
that on the root disk.  Thus, there is a way to partition a hard disk,
but you do have to know your drive's cylinders, heads and sectors.  I
just repartitioned my system yesterday, so I know that muchw works.  :)

A new Linux fdisk, that did the partitioning as well, would be great,
though.  pfdisk is okay, and it works, but it needs to be told the
drive statistics, like I said, and it is a little hard to use.

A couple of days might be too late for 0.95a, but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't work on it, by any means.  I would really like to see a
fdisk that is small, powerful, clean, and not too hard to use.

Now, with the advent of 386BSD; I'm probably going to (at least

HOW TO MAKE A SIMPLE DOS EMULATOR
=================================

Needed
======
1. A 386 or 486 computer
2. A real OS
3. MS-DOS
4. A hard disk
5. Time

Put the 386/486 in virtual 8086 mode.  Trap all interrupts and I/O port
accesses.  Catch the general protection fault to simulate the action of the
hardware.  Initialize the memory segment allocated to this virtual system
to be the same as of DOS at boot time.  Force a boot from a DOS partition
on the hard disk.  Let run.  Puke.
