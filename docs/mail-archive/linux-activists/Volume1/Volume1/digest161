It might be beneficial to use the same naming scheme for smart serial
cards, too. It would hide the differences of the hardware and programs
could just open /dev/tty<letter><number>, even if some of them were
smart cards and others not.

I get the following error from ld when compiling mattrib.o (in mtools):

But stderr *is* defined in stdio.h, which is #included in mattrib.c.

Date: 24 Mar 92 17:55:01 GMT


        Here's a situation I encountered while installing 0.95a
on my Northgate 386. First, the hardware:
        Northgate 386/20 
        4 meg RAM
        Drive one: Imprimis 110 meg RLL (as C: with DR-DOS 6.0)
        Drive two: Microscience 68 meg RLL
        Adaptec 2372B controller
        A: floppy: 1.44
        B: floppy: 1.2 
        Trident 8900 SVGA running a Princeton Ultra 14

        I never had any problems with .12 and .11 to speak of. The change
in the hard drive partition ordering in .95 was confusing, because the FAQ
had the numbering wrong (someone alluded to this in another article). Linus
was kind enough to post a fix when I e-mailed him. Eventually got .95 up, 
even though I had the reset-floppy bug like everyone else.
        In my initial Linux installation, I couldn't get the system to 
install on the second drive at all. That drive had a Coherent partition which I
moved to en extended when I learned Linus doesn't like extended parts. Still,
it wouldn't install. Then I learned that DR-DOS 6.0's fdisk does some odd par
partition ordering the active partition as the *fourth* partition on the
drive partition table. This confused Linux (and me). The fix was to re-
partition the second drive using fdisk from MS-DOS 4.01, which placed the
partitions in the "right" place.
        Before installing .95a, I dumped Coherent, freeing up the 68 meg.
I tried to make the entire drive one file system, but fdisk in Linux wouldn't
do it (the only clue I had that something was wrong was that when I entered the following line: mkfs -c /dev/hdb1 66500, the command would come back with a usage error , as though I entered the command incorrectly. There should be an error
message here that specific (like: "cannot make fs that large"). I dug through
copies of saved articles and found the clue: Linus telling someone else that
64 meg is the biggest file system size.
        Back to DOS fdisk. I created two partitions, one 55 meg and another
about 10 meg. I created a Linux filesystem on the first partition. I then 
looked at the partition setup using Linux fdisk. First partition is okay. 
Below that, it shows the second partition as hdb2, extended, and don't use.
Below *that* it shows hdb5 as what I believe is a subset of hdb2, slightly
smaller (about 10 meg). I decided to create a filesystem on the other
partition for use as a swap file drive. No problem creating the fs. Then, yesterday, I read the note from Linus warning not to use any partition that shows
up as >=hdb5, or the system will mess up the start and stop points of the
partitions. 
        I decided to finish installing the system on the first partition. Late
last night, while installing the kernel source code, the installation quit,
apparently out of drive space. What I discovered was that the files I was
installing (over 10 meg) were somehow ending up on /hdb5, and soon I was
out of room. 
        I had to wipe the filesystem clean, repartition the drive, create
one filesystem on the main partition, and reinstall the entire filesystem
and the supporting files. It was a late night.

        My advice is therefore to carefully check how Linux sees each partition. For some reason, you cannot create a filesystem in the extended partitions at
all, even for use as a swapfile.

  Questions:

2)  My roommate and I are trying to set up a remote terminal

4)  Where can I get the binaries of rz and sz?  I have source but

That was my first thought too, but like I said, it works fine under MSDOS at
33 MHz.
 
    I have noticed that the few people who have mentioned this problem are all

This is not necessarily true. There's no need to include /usr/lib in PATH. All
I did was rename cc1 and cpp to gcc-cc1 and gcc-cpp. I also make a link cpp
in /usr/bin to /usr/lib/gcc-cpp so you can invoke cpp independantly.

        There's an easy way to move files from DOS to Linus using
rawrite, and you don't have to tar the file either. You need to be
sure you have the dd file conversion utility on your linux disk (it was
in the 0.95 distribution, but it may have been dropped on 0.95a. Get it.
        1. Write down the file size in bytes as reposted by DOS. Be 
exact, as this is needed later.
        2. Format a floppy ans rawrite the file to the floppy.
        3. Crank up linux. Put the floppy with the raw file in the disk 
drive and enter this command (this assumes your using a high-density
3.5" drive for a floppy. Change the device as necessary)
        dd if=/dev/PS0 of=filename bs=1 count=filesize
"Filename" is the name of the file, "count" is the DOS size you should
have written down. This command will copy the fil from the floppy to
the current directory on the hard disk. "bs=1" tells the dd command
to do a byte-by-byte copy, as though you transferred an image.
        This worked for me very well today.

        The correct command it set line /dev/ttys2 for com2. Don't forget
to set the modem speed as the next command.

I don't think this is a good idea. It is VERY hard to get this kind
of thing right. Some people have existing minix partitions, others
have OS2 partitions, some want to make the partition autoboot, others
don't. Anyway, I think it will do more harm than that it can help.
(humans are much better than machines at errorsolving. How
would you program the install program when you get a mount error 2?
Forgetting to check the return code will canabalize the root
floppy. Can you find any reasons that could allow your
program to continue?)

Acceptable could be a step by step, highly interactive version, which 
says exacly what it is going to do, and then upon confirmation, will do it.
It should allow the dos users a slightly easier move to linux. 
however for instance, repartitioning a HD is an operation guaranteed to
destroy all data on your hard disk. If you make it too easy, you'll make
some nasty friends. (remember that for instance programs that optimize
hard disks also warn you to backup the hd, which lots of people don't
do, since it is almost never neccessary)

Thanks to all you people out there for making this a very

I'm having some problems after uppgrading to 0.95a.

1. Can't make the gcc1.40 (wich worked wonders under

   This is what happens when I try to compile:

   Program fatal signal 18

   Any ideas ???

2. Can't make the gcc2.0 work proparly. Complains
   about error in include file.

   When compiling I get:

   parse error at or near '(' in line 97 in
   the stdio.h file.

   What is wrong ? (me ?)

3. I final question: I'm no UNIX guru, but I want to take

I have been trying to build ispell for linux with mixed results. I have
successfully compiled all of the binaries but am having difficulties building
a dictionary because the makefile macros use the standard unix spell program for
some processing when building the dictionary files. I have tried building the
dictionary files on a sparc (where they work) and then moving them to linux but
they fail some magic number test in ispell (possibly due to byte translation).

I have been unsuccessful, so far, in tracking down the sources for spell and am
therefore asking does any one have a working version of spell for linux.

Has anyone sucessfully installed newgcc.tar from tsx-11? After my post
about this problem last week, I got mail from several people who had
had this problem. Is it possible tsx-11's newgcc.tar is corrupted
somehow? 

Replacing /usr/bin/as with gccbin/gcc-as from gccbin.tar seems to fix
this problem.
