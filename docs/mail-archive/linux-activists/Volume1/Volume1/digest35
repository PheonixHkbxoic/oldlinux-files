First off, apologies for my ill-advised posting in which I complained that
wait(pid) (as opposed to wait(&status)) caused problems; that's what comes from
storing man pages in my brain rather than on my disk.

Secondly, I have finished the port to Linux of perl, and have wrapped up the
binaries and scripts into a single tar file. I don't have anonymous FTP, so
cannot upload it anywhere useful. If there is any interest, I can mail the
package to somebody who is willing to upload it. The compressed tar file is
272797 bytes and includes:

README.perl a2p c2ph cppstdin find2perl h2ph perl pstruct s2p

The standard 4.019 perl libraries are also needed, of course. I can bundle
them into a separate file if necessary.

Doing the port threw up a few minor problems in libc.a:

(1) atoi() is broken; if you give it something like atoi("&"); it doesn't return
    0 but some apparently random large number.

(2) atof() is broken; it can't parse things like atof("1.2e34"), it just
    discards the exponent. I used sscanf() instead, blecchh.

Also note the caveats in the README file for the perl binary package, included
below:

=============================================================================
Port of perl 4.019 to Linux 0.12 by Andrew Haylett, 3rd February 1992.

Binaries and scripts should probably reside in /usr/local/bin; at least,
cppstdin should, otherwise the `-P' option won't work. Standard 4.019 library
files should reside in /usr/local/lib/perl.

This perl has been compiled with the gdbm-1.5 library under gcc 1.40. It has
passed all its tests, with the following caveats:

        utime() seems to set only the modification time, not the access time.

        SIGPIPE doesn't seem to work properly; it isn't generated when a pipe
        is closed and data written to it, as far as I can see.

        After the first SIGINT, the process dies on subsequent SIGINTs, unless
        the handler is reinstalled after each interrupt. My Sun doesn't do
        this...

        unless (exec(...)) ... doesn't seem to work if the exec'd file
        cannot be found; the perl process has vanished by this time. Mind
        you, that's probably what I'd expect...

        exp(), sqrt() and probably other math functions don't work (perhaps
        due to lack of FP support in the kernel or in libc.a?)

        floating point in general is a bit erratic, hence libraries like
        bigint.pl don't work very well (notably bmul, bdiv, bmod) due
        to rounding errors when dividing/multiplying by 100000. Normal FP
        operations seem all right.

Subject: More info on file system hang
Date: 3 Feb 92 05:02:15 GMT

I've got some more information on my file system hang problem.  I can
now duplicate it.  (Indeed it's difficult to work for any significant
period of time without duplicating it.)  I've got a file with the
Bible on it.  It's 4518238 bytes.  For abstruse reasons, I decided to
try to search through it with more.  That's the real Berkeley more,
not less.  I do "more /usr/bible/bible.txt" and then type "/testif" to
more (a random character string to search for).  The disk whirrs for a
few second, and then the file system locks.  The task is shown in
state 0, all other tasks on the system in state 1.  There's pretty
obviously a race condition somewhere, but I can't say where.  At this
point I'm having hangs often enough that the system is nearly
unusable.

I've tried putting cli/sti around everyplace I can find that looks
suspicious, but that didn't help -- obviously I'm not suspicious
enough.

When yuu're trying to figure this out, please remember that what seems
too have changed to cause it is that I now have a faster disk.

I got all the files I need for patching the kernel, thanks to your help.
I passed the patch -p0 XXX step without problem. However, during making
disk, I got an anoying message:
gcc: ... ... init/main.o init/main.c

There was not file main.o under init/. 
Any suggestion? gcc seems working all right.

Subject: Shoelacing.....
Date: 1 Feb 92 08:42:13 GMT

I thought I undrestood shoelace but, having lost my partition table and had to
restore everything I guess perhaps I don't. Suppose I have Linux (v0.12) and
DOS coexisting on the same hard drive but on different partitions (4 and 3
respectively) and booting from floppy into Linux works a treat what do I have
to type to get Linux to boot, on it's own from the hard disk. I installed
shoelace and laced up in the way I thought the manual said to but all I got was
lots of complaints about /dev/fd0 not found etc etc, and then, in a burst of
late night carelessness I lost my partition table (kinda worrying.... remember
the /u switch in DOS format when you try to get DOS re setup 'cos otherwise
booting is a tad tricky).

While I'm here, two more things....

1. UK keyboards and mtools... do I just install the patches and compile away?
What do I do after that?

2. Documentation.... Linux I like, the documentation I don't.... yeah, I know,
writing manuals is tedious but some of us are just humble unix users with no
major installation/system management experience.... some documentation on some
of the commands might be a good idea..... how about a man command?

It is OK (according to the ANSI standard for C) to give free a NULL
pointer.  It is in effect a nop operation, i.e. it doesn't do anything
(except use some time).  This was not necessarily true for pre-ANSI C
(i.e., some libraries probably accepted it, some dumped core).

Subject: Partitioning hard disks
Date: 3 Feb 92 15:20:03 GMT

There seems to be many horror stories going around about preparing hard
disk partitions for linux, the way I saw in the FAQ, a while back was
particularly scary. Here my suggestion for the FAQ.


1) Get the part program from the fdisk package.

2) Use the dos fdisk and create your dos, partition and a extended partition
the size you want the first two partitions, say using 50% of the disk in
total. 

3) After fdisk (machine reboots) use part to change the extended (and
primary if you don't want DOS) to type Xenix.

4) back into fdisk create another extended partition (it will let you now).

5) return to 3) if you want yet another partition.



Using this method I partitioned my two drives with DOS5.0 primaries and the
rest to linux. No playing with sector editors. No Special (expensive)
software (other than DOS :-). Apart from fdisk insisting on rebooting all
the time, its fairly quick.  Having used the DOS fdisk to create the
partitions I trust that they are correct, slightly more than I would had
they been made by any other means.

Volunteering ?

   I wanted
   two 64M partitions, and had the following problems:

     minix fdisk - resulting sizes under linux fdisk looked completely 
           unrelated to reality
     DOS 5.0 fdisk - limited to one primary partition, and of course
           linux wants its own primary partitions
     DOS 3.2 fdisk - refused to make partitions over 32MB, or to
           place them anywhere other than the beginning of the disk.
     edpart - tended to hang whenever I tried to get it to do something
           I couldn't get the DOS fdisks's to do.

   I finally used fdisk from Microport's SV/AT (a port of System V
   release 2 for the PC AT).  I suspect this is not a solution for most
   people.  (I don't actually have SV/AT installed at the moment.  All I
   had to do was boot the installation floppy.  It has fdisk.)  This is
   the only version of fdisk that does what you really want: you can make
   paritions anywhere, of any size, and for each choose whether it's a
   DOS partition (produces an old-style primary DOS partition) or a Unix
   partition.  I'm not sure what to tell people with big disks who don't
   own SV/AT.

Basically ISC's (386 UNIX) will work too :-). I can also recommend the
Norton Utilities version 5 diskedit.exe. It's even better than my own
disk editor (which has a very RAW user interface). The partition table
in the master boot block isn't all that difficult to decipher and it's
layout is even documented in the DOS Technical Reference manals and
should be in your favorite "DOS Internals" book. If all you need is 1
primary DOS partition and 1 Linux partition, you could simply created
an "extended partiton" and USE that for Linux. If Linux depends on
some special OS marker simply change that single byte in the master
boot block. If someone really needs a DOS based disk editor that uses
the BIOS to access the physical disk I could send a Turbo Pascal 5.0
source. That editor is CRUDE, UNINTUITIVE and DANGEROUS and I won't
recommend it to anyone but me (but then I wrote it and it works just
great for me). It's also fast and VERY small (7K binary size).

So do I (having been used to BSD). And if there is a standard that
requires this, it's a bad standard. I think that the annoying and
unnecessary limitations of certain systems should not be standardized.
See what has happened with MS-DOG. The same stupid name length as in
CP/M and it just sits there because of "backward compatibility".

Anyway, I've seen Linus promise to double the filename length and also
other strategic variables in the fs, so this should not be a problem
for us.

Actually I don't know what SHOULD be done, but I had the same problem
with an old facit terminal and I "fixed" it by changing the outgoing
NL translation in tty_io.c to CRNL. Maybe it can be set with some

I have been trying to do the same thing but to use a modem connected to

Do I have to configure my modem in a different way?

1)  Of the two kermits that were in linux .12 I'm using the one that
    would connect to the port (the other one just came back to the
    kermit prompt after the connect command before I could type anything
    to the modem).  I think it is ver. 4a.  I've noticed three things
    about it:
      a)  it doesn't read .kermrc automatically, I have to type "take .kermrc"
      b)  ! rm /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..tty64 doesn't do anything, I have to
          leave kermit and type it to the os.
      c)  I can't edit when I use kermit to call a vax/vms system because
          the vt200 type setup sequences put my screen into line drawing
          mode, and also because none of keys on the ~(&$@* ibm style
          keyboard work in a vms editor.
    If I ever finish installing patches and trying to get the basic system
    up to what everyone else is using a try to put kermit 5a (or newer if
    available) on it and see if it addresses any of these problems.  In
    the interim, does anyone have any suggestions?

2)  When I put a file system on a floppy and started copying a lot of files
    to it with cp, the message it gave when the floppy was full was:
    "not owner".  I'd look at the code but I'm not a guru (yet).

3)  When I use shoelace to boot I get the "cannot size swap space" message.
    I've received mail indicating that it might be due to the minix v. linux
    partition numbering problem which I will experiment more with tonight.

I would be gratefull for anyone willing to share suggestions on the
above problems.  Thanks.
