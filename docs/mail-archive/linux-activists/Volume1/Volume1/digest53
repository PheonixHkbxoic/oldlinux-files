Well.. I'm running Linux on a DTC RLL controller.. but I don't know
which DTC controller.  I bought the system used and have been able
to gather that it's a DTC HD/FD controller which is only capable of
a 3:1 interleave.  The board itself has no model number.. and the
roms only identify it as a DTC controller.

I recently posted a news about the problem I got when I tried to install

got any response.  The following is all the message I got when I
booted up my machine with the bootimage:

After that, the floppy drive stopped, or keeping on spinning, it depends.
Could someone on the net give me any hint to successfully boot up and Linux

Heh, I'm willing to bet it is. I got a newly booted system to die by
just mcopy'ing two LARGE files from floppy to disk, one after the other.
I've got 4 Mb real memory and no swap, though.

Subject: Memory management primitives
Date: 15 Feb 92 22:18:57 GMT

To Linux & Gnu Hurd hackers:

Future enhancement request: 
please arrange RAM management so that one of these two hacks are possible:

1) Separately controlled virtual address space.
If an allocator can allocate separate pages of address space
anywhere in 32 bits and point them at "real" memory, 
it can allocate a separate unique VM address for every
allocated chunk.  When that chunk is freed, the 
allocator can then turn off that virtual page.
Each allocation uses up a new virtual page, and old
pages are not reclaimed until it has too.  This allows
the MMU to fail on a dangling reference.

Note that you don't have to use up 4K for every
allocation request.  You pack the allocated chunks in
"real" memory and set multiple virtual pages to point to
that memory, and hand back a new virtual page for each allocation.

2) Separately controlled 386 segments.
This requires a compiler option and a separate system library.
The idea is that pointers are 32-bit clumps with segment numbers
and offsets packed into one longword.  Every pointer reference
has to unpack the value, set the segment, etc.  Yes, it's slow.
In fact, it will crawl.  But! the above trick only catches dangling
references.  This trick freaks out of every misuse of malloc'd memory,
because segments can be set to an arbitrary length, from 1 byte to a
megabyte.  This trick also uses several times more RAM per "virtual
address" than trick #1.

Note that most programs that are heavy users of malloc'd RAM
make lots of errors that rarely happen to cause problems.
if you implement either of the above hacks, packages that look
like useful test cases will die all over the place and you'll
think your stuff doesn't work :-)  The old 286 Unixes had
a similar problem: developers complained to us when their code
did illegal but harmless memory accesses that "always work on
other computers".

Whoever implements the trick #2 will make their OS the
Unix C/C++ platform of choice.  I need this, and only
Intel CPUs can deliver it because their MMU's are soooooooooo screwy.

I got Linux running OK off a floppy today.  When I fdisk, it shows all the
partitions correctly, and when I mkfs -c /dev/hd7 9228 (I want my Linux root
partition to be the second partition on my second drive) it comes back with 
no errors.

Then, the first time I try mount /dev/hd7 /, it returns error 16; all subse-
quent tries return error 2.

I am using a Gateway 2000 386/25 with a DTC 7287 RLL controller.  Does anyone
know what's wrong here?

Hi all, 
        Well I have been following this group and finally got around
   to trying Linux. I retrieved the install stuff from MIT, but it just hangs.
   I'm posting here since I have an Amstrad computer, and I believe that 
   Amstrad computers are more popular in European/Germanic countries.

        Anyway, does anyone out there have Linux running on an
   Amstrad computer? If you do, could you help me get it going on mine?
   I have an Amstrad 1386, with 4M ram, 1.44M (A:), 1.2M (B:), and two
   hard drives (120M Seagate-1144 (C:) and a 40M Western Digital (D:) ).

        Right now once I get the boot image onto floppy, with rawrite,
   it reads the floppy for about  two seconds and then just sits there. I
   tried transfering the file a few times, without recieving errors, without
   any success.

I can't seem to get a filesystem up and running on my 386/33. When I type in
fdisk it says the filesystem I want to use for Linux is of an unknown type, and
when I use mkfs everything works out fine until I try to mount the filesystem.
I get a mount: error 16 or something of the sort. How exactly are you supposed
to go about setting up a filesystem for Linux that will *WORK*??? I was
screwing with EDPART and all of a sudden my computer can't find my PRIMARY DOS

actually, mmap is a truly wonderful thing if done well.

sample uses i have seen include:


lazy read of disk buffers in sun's implementation of read.  at a user
level, this can save a copy in i/o intensive programs.

implementing guard pages for triggering garbage collection.

allowing copy on write so that lisp can share all unmodified bits with
other lisp processes, but not worry what bits those are.

implementation of novel vm schemes by trapping SIGSEGV.

data bases which mmap huge files and then depend on virtual memory to
swap them in as needed.  this allows the use of simple methods such as
fast in-memory string searches to be used on files.  great fun.

a lexical analyzer can mmap an entire file copy on write and then run
the lexical analyzer destructively on the mmap'ed source code.

Subject: new copy of KA9Q TCP/IP
Date: 16 Feb 92 08:28:25 GMT

I've just put up new copies of ka9qbin.tar.Z and ka9qsrc.tar.Z in
athos:/pub/linux.  The primary difference compared with last week's
copy is that I've done a lot more testing and bug fixing.  I've also
revised the READ.ME in ka9qbin.tar.Z, to give a bit more advice about
configuration, and added (primitive) domain name server support.

Here are the primary bug fixes:
  cd and pwd now work
  "tcp mss" used to affect only outgoing but not incoming connections
  there was a bug in header compression that would cause connections
        to hang when sending files with a small mss
  there was a bug in the IP code that cause cause bytes to be missing
        in files retrieved via ftp.

This is all the work I plan to do on KA9Q for the moment.  The major
problem now is really in the kernel: the tendency to lose characters
coming in one serial lines.

By the way, I've been doing a lot of file manipulations today, and
have had no hangs or file system problems.  I begin to think Linus is
right that the apparently file system problems are really memory
management problems.  I made them go away by allocating a swap
partition, which I hadn't been using before.

Subject: Few comments about Linux
Date: 16 Feb 92 12:29:46 GMT


Hello !
This time I have few comments to make, hopefully they are useful :-)

1) I see a some people would like to load linux with a lot of stuff.
   What I remembar is:
   DOS emulation
   Strange ( Possibly useful ) MMU management
   Got a letter saying that quota, cpu usage, other stuff for checking the
   user behaviour is useful.
   Other stuff... may possibly follow.....

2) My personal view of Linux is as follow
   Linux should be FAST and SIMPLE since it runs on machines that are not
   the fastest in the world and since it should be easy to understand.
   The point is that if you need a system with all the gadgets then you buy
   Sun or other stuff......

3) Therefore, what are we going to put in the kernel ?
   A simple memory management... 64Mb x task and 64 Max tasks are ok
   After all... how fast will the 386 be with 64 tasks ??
   This memory model keeps the page table in memory and this is a GOOD
   thing for speed.
   A simple mode for doing things... What springs in mind is PS... I am not
   saying that a syscall for asking things to the kernel is wrong. I am
   saying that it will make things more complicated giving a low enhancement
   in performance. And you have to solve problems like passing lists
   and receiving lists... not the simplest thing in the world.
   BTW It is possible to have a "standard" way to interrogate /dev/kmem
   even without using a syscall. ( A library will do it, outside the
   kernel)

4) TCP... well we need TCP for X11 :-) Therefore we can't leave that out
   but it will be nice to have it as a kind of optional ( after all 
   not everybody has all the disk needed to load X11 )
   Solaris is going to have loadable kernel drivers..... Is there a simple
   way to have this ?

I am not trying to stop people to make linux "better" I am just saying that
the more complex things are the easyer it is to have bugs in them and we
don't want bugs around, don't we ?
Let's try to do things in a simple way ! Let's try to remembar that the
MOST important thing is to have the interface to the OS right. The kernel
can be simple and limited but who cares... as long as it WORKS !
