Hi there !

Just a suggestion: I think it would be nice to have the complete Linux stuff 
available as one tar.Z file. It would save net traffic and other people could
make it available without losing too much of their own diskspace. This should
increase the number of users and, as a followup, the number of contributors.

Discussion about this may start now :) .

Linus asked me to try the prebuilt image rather than one built with
gcc 1.4.  I've been using it, and it may make some difference.  I
haven't seen the free_page_tables called with wrong alightment crash,
which I was getting pretty often with my kernel.  However I am still
seeing wierdness in the display and/or keyboard code.  The display
glitches in a variety of ways, including a group of lines repeated,
wierd characters appearing in random colors, and the screen
redisplaying every time I hit a screen.  Usually refreshing the screen
with ^L or whatever the program wants fixes things.  I suspect the
scrolling code used when a scroll region is in effect, though there
could be multiple problems.

I haven't been doing any disk I/O tonight -- just reading and
processing news over a telnet connect in KA9Q, so I don't know whether
the HD problem is fixed.

At the moment I think I recommend using either the prebuilt image
or compiling with gcc 2.0.

        I have a 486-33 clone, AMI bios 7/7/91 and I also am having problems
with the new & improved floppy driver in (0.95). The boot disk works fine,
(cute little dots, select video mode etc), however the root disk gives me
15 ( one track ?) reset-floppy called messages then settles down and seems
to load. I then get 
(none) login:
and login as root. At this point I get two messages reading
_setutent: can't open utmp: no such file or directory.

        I tried the obvious, different floppies, new copy from tsx.
0.12 worked fine.

        Another question. Is the device numbering the same as in 0.12,
i.e. is /dev/hdb2 -> 0x307 ?

With all of the trivial stuff like kernel hacking going on, I decided
to do something important :-), like port a game.  Torus (robots) is
now available at tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/usr.games/torus.tar.Z
Read the README for installation instructions..sorry I lost the man page,
but it's easy to figger out the options in main.c.  As for the scorefiles,
'echo > score_file_name' ought to work too (I used touch).  If you wanna
compile it yourself, make sure you have the patched libc/curseslib combo.   
There are some high score options you may want to change, sooooo....

I rebuilt linux-0.95 with gcc-1.40 and had no problems like

can anyone tell me what exactly causes the error messages: fork: try
again, and fork: no more processes ? they seem to happen     rather
randomly after the system has been running for a while (more than an
hour). sometimes if i exit my current shell and start a new one it
will let me do stuff for a little while but eventually it won't let me
do anything so  i exec sync and reboot. then it is okay again for a
little while. has anyone else had this happen, or know what can be
done to fix it ? i'm still running 0.12.

Try looking in your /dev directory.  The root-image I got didn't have all

Hi,

Gcc 2.0 seems released in the way I don't intend to be. I just found
out it is not compatible with 0.95. I am working on it now. Please
don't use gcc 2.0 with 0.95 kernel, 0.12 should be fine.

PLEASE REMEMBER GCC 2.0 IS JUST AN ALPHA. IT IS NOT VERY STABLE. YOU

I've experienced the same problem with a 5.25" 1.2M floppy as drive A:.
The only difference is that the floppy resets never stop on my machine (but
I did reboot after a few screens worth of the floppy-grinding reset messages
had scrolled by -- it sounded painful), and my machine never had its CMOS
reset.  It appears that the new improved floppy code has a weird glitch in
it with certain hardware.  I'm running a DELL System 325 which has a Phoenix
bios in it, FYI.

I managed to upgrade to .95 anyway, by booting a .12 system and copying most
of the files off the .95 root disk (I took steps to copy the dev directory
without disturbing the in-use devices, and to copy the files without ever
overwriting a running executable).  The result is a normal .95 system except
for the inability to mount a floppy in the A: drive.  Fortunately, I am
able to mount disks in my 1.4M* B: drive without problem, and the speed in
untarring files from this disk is greatly improved.  Since I rarely use my
A: drive, I'm content for the moment with .95.  However, I think I'll look
into the floppy code and see if I can spot anything wrong.

> Any suggestions, ideas, fixes, sympathy, encouragement would be greatly
> appreciated.  For now I'm still using 0.12 :(.

If you can live with using your hard disk and a B: drive (if you have one)
then I believe you can make .95 work for you.

I just booted, and after inserting the root and typing enter I get 15
error messages, after which the machine booted fine, but slower than
0.12. I still haven't moved the 0.95 to the hard drive though, I'm
playing around with it on the floppy, to make sure there are no other
surprises. I think I'll try booting at a lower speed, to see if it makes
any difference.

There are two sys calls, isatty and ttyname, which are used by gcc 2.0

work with 0.95 since those sys call numbers are used by the other sys
calls. Something has to be done before use gcc 2.0 with 0.95 kernel.

[I sent this to Linus first thing this morning but he doesn't appear to be
available to (ie. not response yet).  I'm posting this to the net so I can
hopefully get my system back up tonight.]

I repartitioned my hard disk last night to give Linux more room.  After
re-creating and verifying my new, smaller, extended DOS partition, I
booted Linux 0.95 from floppy to re-install on my new, larger, Linux
partition and got some strange results from fdisk.

It reported my primary and extended DOS partitions as expected, hda2 and
hda3, respectively.  It also reported another DOS partition on hda5.  I
know you added preliminary support for extended partitions in 0.95 so I'm
guessing hda5 is my logical drive D: on the extended DOS partition.  It's
about the right size.

Now comes the strange part.  My new Linux partition was reported on hda8!
I expected it on hda4.  I don't know if it's a coincidence that what was
left on the disk looked like an extended partition to Linux or whether
something is wrong with the partition table.  I had used pfdisk to do the
repartitioning.  Anyway, I didn't want to run mkfs without checking with
you first.  Any ideas?
