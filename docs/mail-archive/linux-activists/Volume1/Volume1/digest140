| I actually got 386BSD up and running.  It is a *MESS*.  People have compared
        It seems to depend on your hardware... I've got a 486/40, AMI
Bios, and I haven't had any major problems getting 386BSD up and on
the net using SLIP. (I haven't seen any of the "extra interrupt"
problems on my system.) Sure it is a little shaky in places, but it
isn't a year behind linux -- it's hard to even compare them
meaningfully. (Linux has it's own style of shakiness... 0.12 would
wedge if I tried to doshell to a pty that wasn't configured at
startup, for example.) I know of someone successfully using the WD
ethernet code, too.
        The difference is that Linux was constructed whole from
scratch, recently, while BSD has been developed over years. Linux
started out with a 386 base, whereas BSD started out on VAXen and the
386 code was only recently written. There are a lot of OS'es out there
which started with earlier versions of the BSD code -- SunOS and
Ultrix, just to name about 50% of the workstation market :-) So parts
of BSD are "vintage" and parts are very new.
        For myself, the difference is that I can get more real work
done under 386BSD than I can under Linux. (NFS is already there, SLIP
is already there, etc.) This is a statement, not a criticism -- Linux
is a "good thing", having it under GPL is a *really* good thing. It's
an interesting kernel to hack on. In time, people will port other
features to it. There is a place for both... and I expect to see a
large amount of "cross-pollination."

Not at all.  The MIT libaries and window managers are still available.
The Motif and OPENLOOK stuff looks sort of cute, but from a functional
point of view twm is quite reasonable.  Note that Sun has donated the
libraries need to do openlook applications, as well as the OPENLOOK
window manager to the consortium, so you can use OL if you want to.  I

Hello Linuxers,

Since I'm fairly low on disk space, I've switched out Emacs in favor
of groff as my disk hog.  I have Jove 4.14.7 (from ftp.cs.toronto.edu)
working (i.e. i-shells & job-stopping), except that the screen
keeps getting messed up.

I'm using gcc 2.0 and linux 0.95a (the same thing happened with gcc 1.40)

I don't think its jove, since the same code compiles fine on the
school HPUX machine, and its probably not the console driver, since
I can use Linux to acces Jove on the school computer over the telephone
using the HPUX termcap entry for vt100, and the screen doesn't get
bungled.

Has anyone had similar problems?  Also has anyone ported Jove and
NOT had screen problems (especially with i-search)?

Additionally, has anyone ported CRISP?

I'm rather anxious to find a usable editor that fits
in < 1MB disk space :-)

Thanks much,

David.

Hello

I've been using gcc-2.0 with no difficulty (other than a few
problems with the header files that can be easily worked around).

I keep hearing how shared libs make the executables so much smaller,
and I can see for myself that the files in the shared/bin directory
*are* small :-)

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to compile using shared libs
versus static libs.  How does one specify this at linking?

Gratefully,

Winstead and the second person (with the amazing mail address.... do you have

everything I write which involves (for the HD partitioning bit which will be
out as soon as my HD stops misbehaving and I stop corrupting my only floppy
copy of the rootimage :-)) repartitioning my HD to a full DOS only setup,
repartitioning to DOS and Linux, noting down EVERYTHING that happens,
reinstalling 2 filesystems, writing it all up, removing ambiguities and trying
to make it all sound easy and straightforward etc etc etc. Why should someone
else freeload on the things everyone else has contributed for free.

   It's appropriate, although theoretically one can have multiple host adapters,
   etc to get over 7 drivers.

True, and multiple LUN's (at least 2) per controller should also be
supported. In fact, I often run SCSI-based systems with multiple
host adapters.

Extended partitions should also, IMHO, be defined with their own letter,
like they were just multiple filesystems in a single partition (as in
SCO Xenix and Unix). The system should of course support using only a
single extended partition with multiple file systems.

"Primary" partition support could very well be dropped as too dos'ian thing.
An operating system should not need to use more than one entry in the
"master" partition table.

So, we end up with at least:

SCSI disks:     [r]sdHCLPF      where   H = host adapter [0-1],
                                        C = controller [0-7],
                                        L = LUN [0-1],
                                        P = partition [0-4] and
                                        F = file system [0-7, for example]

Each disk controller would of course need an own major number, but this
should not be a problem. This is also what SCO Unix does.

You have compiled the kernel with finnish keyboard. U.S. keyboard is the

1) how do I modify the boot disk to boot from my hard drive (is there
   a program to do this?)
2) is there a binary for a term program available via anonymous ftp?
   This would make the /usr/bin build much easier...
3) why the suggested 4meg ram for gcc?  Will gcc run in 2meg?

a DELL, I have a VIP 386SX-16 with Phoenix BIOS, 40Mb IDE. I've read
some traffic on comp.os.msdos.desqview about Not Ready Errors (NRE's)

Date: 23 Mar 92 17:24:05 GMT

Now that .95a is out, I am preparing the "ABC Release of Linux of .95a".  This
will be comprised of full source and binary for as many software packages as I
can find, including compilers, utilities, games, user applications, and
whatever else you are willing to send me!

Distribution of the "ABC Release of Linux .95a" will be completely free, and
will be available for anonymous FTP from banjo.concert.net, when it becomes
available.  I may also offer floppy-disk based distribution at a cost-recovery
price, but that has not yet been established.

I will *NOT* be distributing a root or boot diskette, as they are already
being done.  Source for the kernel *WILL* be included in the distribution.

Now, the request:

        Anyone having ported a package to Linux that you would like to
        see in the "ABC Release of Linux .95a", please upload the *SOURCE*
        to the directory /private/ABC.Release on banjo.concert.net.

        Please make the sources into a single tar file including a README,
        a Makefile, and instructions on building and installing the package.
        Please also note any dependancies on other packages.  The packages
        should follow the Linux File System Standard 1.0 for placement of
        supporting files.

        The sources will be put into the directory tree under /usr/src and
        will then become standard parts of the ABC Release of Linux .95a.

I will *ONLY* take packages that are uploaded to banjo, as I am not sure of
the lineage of many of the packages that are currently available in the 
archives.  If you have ported software, SEND IT TO ME!

I am asking for SOURCE since I will be distributing both sources and binaries,
and I would like to assure that it can be built under the current version of
Linux.  If you have ported a package that you would like to have distributed
in BINARY FORM ONLY, please let me know.

All sources will remain the "property" of the person that did the port, and
that person (NOT ME!) will be responsible for keeping me up-to-date on any
changes that are made to that package.  I will be acting only as a coordinator,
and will not modify sources at all.  If a package does not compile/install/run,
I will notify the person that did the port, and wait for a new version that
does work.

Patches may be made available at a later time to allow easy upgrades to the
"most current version" of the packages, but I expect in the short term to just
replace the old version with the new ones and make an announcement.

Hi there!

I found Linux some days ago when searching for 386BSD. Rather good stuff but
installation is quite difficult. My problem: 0.95a ist successfully installed
on hd but i'm not able to transfer any files i've downloaded on my DOS-
partition. After writing a file with rawrite i can't mount the disk on Linux.
The mount command says: mount: error 16.
Here is what i did:
        writing an image of an file (ie. kermit.z) with rawrite under dos5:
                rawrite
                 source: kermit.z
                 destination: a
        booting Linux:
                mount /dev/PS0 /mnt
                -> mount: error 16

Are you sure about this?  I'd be surprised to hear that suspend/resume has

Linux driver to handle the interrupts properly.

I have a Sampo 386SX notebook.  Linux runs fine on it as long as I disable
all the power-save features, such as screen blank, disk power-down, and
suspend/resume.  I think these could all be handled with proper drivers in
Linux.

However, I wonder if these features are handled in any "standard" way
across all models of notebooks.  I tend to doubt it.  I think the new 386SL
based notebooks may be more standard, since the power-save features are
built into the processor rather than "tacked-on" by the manufacturer.

If anybody knows details about how suspend/resume or other "power-save"
features work, I'd appreciate any details you can offer.  Maybe someday
I'll write the necessary drivers.  It'd sure be nice to extend my battery
life beyond 3 hours!
