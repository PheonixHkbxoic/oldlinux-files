Not that it makes any difference (to alt.os.linux people, anyway), but
OS/2 2.0 will provide DPMI, but _not_ VCPI.  DPMI does not allow the
client program to determine which protection ring to run in, VCPI on
the other hand, DOES allow the client to determine which ring to 
run in.

Windows, on the other hand, is going to be a little nasty to deal with.
It'll probably be possible to run it in 'real' mode, but not 'standard'
or '386'.  Not that it matters, anyway...X is better.

Actually we should start discussing the level of kernal support for graphics.
I'd prefer a loadable library or device driver approach, with a standardized
call interface. Incidentally, as far as I know 16 bit SVGA's based on TSENG
4000's are capable of being mapped to a 1Mb linear memory segment in the
first 16Mb of the address space, as well as 16 bit access to their video
memory. Now if I could just find the information for doing so, and the code
to initialize various graphics modes (I am particularly interested in 800x600
at 256 colors) I would start writing pieces of a graphics library...

Actually, the GNU Hurd is neither a kernel, nor just a filesystem.  It
is a Hird of Unix Replacing Daemons (among other things) that include a
filesystem, ttys, and exec, proc, and authorization servers that the
Mach kernel does not provide itself.  Mach is by itself just a nifty
little kernel and doesn't provide much of the functionality needed for
modern unix operating systems.

See ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu for the GNU Hurd sources.

I take it that this is a replacement for the hd driver currently in the kernel.
How difficult will it be to hack it so I can have both controllers?

Date: 1 Mar 92 11:56:04 GMT

A very small problem.
I have a bit more space in the HD and it is partitioned as follows.

/dev/hd1        DOS     ( The original 40Mb disk , Disk C: )
/dev/hd6        Linux   /usr
/dev/hd7        Linux   /
/dev/hd8        DOS     ( Some more 40Mb , Disk D: )
/dev/hd8        Linux   swap

This can be seen using fdisk from linux

# fdisk
/dev/hd1:  41471 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hd6:  59670 blocks unknown partition type 0x9E
/dev/hd7:  20527 blocks unknown partition type 0x9E
/dev/hd8:  41046 blocks 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hd9:   6247 blocks unknown partition type 0x9E

Tryng to use the swap partition results in a "can't stat ..."
Tryng to mkfs it results in 

# mkfs -c /dev/hd9 6247
mkfs: unable to open /dev/hd9

I suppose it is because is over the 64Mb limit ...
Is this the reason ?
If so

Will the next release have a better filesystem ?
( Long filenames, and support for bigger HD )

No work.  The SCSI drivers are entirely separate from the normal
hard disk driver.  In fact, the SCSI drivers configure themselves
at boot time, detecting which host adapters are present, where 
those host adapters are in the address space, and what scsi
devices are on the scsi bus(es).

This allows the same distribution kernel to be used for normal, Seagate
SCSI, and soon other SCSI hosts as well.

Subject: SCSI drivers are uploaded
Date: 1 Mar 92 15:47:13 GMT

Ok, here's the current state of things :

I was up all night fixing bugs, changing the time-consuming 
parts of the seagate driver to inline assembler (less than 1/3 the 
size of the 'C' it replaced, over 4 times as fast) and documenting
things a little better.

And not only does it still work, but the seagate driver is about 4 times
faster than the straight 'C' version without arbitration, and an order of
magnitude faster than the version with arbitration.

I have uploaded the following files to nic.funet.fi and tsx-11.mit.edu
under incomming : 

bootimage-0.12.seagate.Z        bootable image for seagate st01/03
                                host adapters at C8000.  Heavily 
                                modified.

fdisk.scsi.tar.Z                fdisk that recognizes hard disk 0, 1,
                                and the first scsi disk. 

scsi.shar.Z                     source code to this mess.
                                        
scsi.user.doc.Z                 user documentation that says 
                                these are the major minor numbers,
                                and what the rest of the files are.

The current flaws :

High level drivers : 
sd.c needs some cleaning up still, and I'd like to move 
most of the error handling and request sense down to the 
mid level drivers. 

st.c :
        it's a stub.  

seagate low level : 
The uploaded bootimage is hardcoded to 
address c8000 (The detection routines are there, but I only 
have a signature that detects a BIOS revision 2.00 - have to 
scrounge my mail or pull the chip from my dead ST-02 and 
get the other signatures ), and currently the routine is not interrupt driven.  
(Not sure how much we'll gain from this.)

Enjoy.

Subject: EGA/VGA screen fonts in Linux
Date: Sun, 1 Mar 1992 15:51:40 GMT

I'd like to have access to soft fonts in Linux (primarily because I do
a lot of work in Hebrew).  First of all, has anyone started working on
this?  I don't think it will be be very difficult.  But I'm still
trying to decide what the best interface will be.  Reprogramming the
video card, of course, can affect not just the process running but
also other virtual terminals, so the font change belongs in the
kernal.  But what should the system call be?  

One possiblity is to allow ordinary users to download any font they
see fit, with perhaps a system call to take a block of memory and use
it for the font table.  Ordinary users would them be able to download
nonsense into the font table, and mess up all the displays.  Perhaps
only processes owning a virtual terminal should have access to this
feature.

Another possibility is to make a list of fonts in a non-writable
directory, and only load fonts from that list, so ordinary users can't
screw things up too much.

Ideally, the font-change should only affect the virtual terminal from
which it was requested, but I'm not sure I know how to do that.  I
suppose it's a matter of keeping track of the video RAM and
storing/restoring it, but I haven't looked at the VC code in the
kernal yet.

Comments?  Thoughts?  Suggestions?

No, the reason is a very stupid mistake I did when making the root
floppy: I just copied my /dev-directory over to the floppy. No problem,
but for the fact that I don't have a /dev/hd7-9, so the special files
simply aren't on the floppy and thus they won't get installed on your
harddisk either...

The problem is happily very easy to correct: you just make the necessary
special files with mknod:

# mknod /dev/hd8 b 3 8
# mknod /dev/hd9 b 3 9

and everything should work again.

>Will the next release have a better filesystem ?

No. 0.13 still uses the minix fs, but the routines have been much better
localized, and with some additional (minor) work, it will at least be
possible to write a better fs. The 0.12 filesystem was very much
hardcoded for the minix layout.

Date: 1 Mar 92 16:14:07 GMT

On normal Unix machines, killing init will take you down into 
single user mode.  We should do this, making init run from an
exec - fork instead of an exec.

Shutdown : 
If you accidentally leave elvis running on a file, in another window,
you end up with a permanantly busy file if you reset.  A shutdown
command / syscall which killed everything else off would be nice.
 
Reaping zombies : 
Every so often, my workstation goes around, makes init (pid 1) the parent
of all zombies, and then kills them properly.  With the 64 proc  process table
that fills up with crond zombies in just a few days, linux definately 
needs this.

Anoying kernel messages : 
instead of going to the fg console, printk() and panic() calls should print 
to a user specified device - virtual console, tty, or lp.  Come to 
think of it, a syslog would be nice.

This would send all kernel messages one place, where they would not 
interfere with other activities on the system, and let developers see 
debugging output from their kernel hacks one place, while still
working unimpaired on another terminal (virtual or real).
