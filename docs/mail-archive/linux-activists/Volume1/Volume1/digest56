I have recently installed Linux 0.12 on my 486.. I have got just about everything
from tsx-11..... and have gcc running. When I tried to make 'mylogin3' it went well
until it reported errors - it couldn't find _ttyname, _gethostname, and _initgroups.
What do I do to fix this?

Another thing - does anybody know how to get the floating point working with gcc - 
are there any extra files I need?

Thanking you in advance...
        Jeff Shaw.

Hello 
Few more questions....

1) I installed poe-login and it works great with the simpleinit.c
   Simpleinit.c mimic the SYSV init schema that I think is a bit better
   that BSD ( I already feel the flames :-) ) since it has the following
   features:
   a) You can change the init level of the system. This mean that you
      assign to the programs that init starts an init level. Eg getty has
      initlevel 2, network stuff initlevel 3, singleuser initlevel S or 1.
      If you want to go from singleuser to multiuser just type telinit 2.
      Want to go to network level , type telinit 3, wnat to go BACK to
      multiuser but no network, type telinit 2.
   b) The structure is organized in subdirectory for each init level and
      each package can add its's own startup code and shutdown code :-)
   I added a SIMPLE reboot syscall to linux and took away the CTRL-ALT-DEL
   stuff . My problem is : If I modify poe login to have init levels and a
   'standard' inittab is there people interested ?
   ( If anybody wonder what reboot has to do with init.... you usually go
   to single user before doing reboot :-) )
   Anyway, the question is this: What is the "best" way to pass A single
   char from a running program to another ? ( Init needs to be told what is
   the current init level you want to reach )

2) I am writing the format program and I need to retrieve the geometry of
   the HD from kernel :-). I havent' tryed to see if /dev/kmem is broken,
   people say it is :-) The question is : Anybody fixed /dev/kmem ?

Damiano

P.S. Continuing the thread of "Ps in the kernel". My question 2 is a
tipical example of real situation. I NEED some informations from the
kernel.  If I have /dev/kmem I just look for it. If I have a syscall then I
have to see if the thing I want is supported, if it is not then ADD some
more stuff to the poor kernel ( possibly adding errors ) to have my
information back..... I think the solution is a library interface between
the kernel and ps. If some rare program has some strange need you can
always use /dev/kmem and bypass the library :-)

        Myself, for one -- 486/40 + 210M disk + 16M RAM + 15" monitor
all totaled under $3K, which was my total system budget (literally all
the money I had available) $1K for an operating system would have
taken a big chunk out of what hardware I can get (and that's for
something like ESIX.) While I'm not personally in complete agreement
with the political side of the GNU Manifesto, particularly the
programming tax, I do believe that CopyLeft is a good idea, and use it
myself. Besides, I've got years of experience kernel hacking (BSD
kernel of course) and would be very annoyed if I couldn't fix things
on my *own* system. So the price is more like $20K for a commercial
O/S (well, $1K for BSDi but that isn't quite commercial and wasn't
quite available when I started on this.)

|> What CAN be done is a set of functions that LOOK into /dev/kmem and extract
        BSD (and likewise SunOS) demonstrated that /dev/kmem was a bad
idea for "real" code (very useful for kernel debugging, though.) I
want a *deterministic* interface to the kernel data structures. (Just
having libkvm is not enough; kvm_open, kvm_read are useless, though
kvm_nextproc and such are a gesture in the right direction -- if they
didn't used /dev/kmem, they might even work.) I get "process
information unavailable" due to the process table changing out from
underneath ps often enough to be annoying.
        Also, note that the system call to read the table could be
made non-privileged, whereas /dev/kmem and /dev/mem can't be readable
by "normal" users if you are even pretending to have security.
        (Note also that most systems use /dev/mem to read the system
"load", something else which should have a system call of its own; I
don't think posix specifies that such a function might even exist,
since there are so many ways to do it [like the RS/6000 under AIX 3.1:
it simply doesn't do it at all...])

I guess that something must be wrong with the shell field for user root
in /etc/passwd. Or maybe you didn't recompile the simpleinit.c program with
RUN_RC defined? That way, your /etc/rc file wont be run, and your file systems
are not mounted. (I know, I forgot that last night, and ran into similar 
problems).

We should get a real passwd program, such as the one in the Perl book, or
npasswd. If you want give all accounts the same password, then you are wrong
:-), but something along the lines of:

        perl -pi.bak -e 's/^(\w+):[^:]*:/\1:xxSDFSssfer:/' /etc/passwd
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                         your own encrypted passwd      

might work...

Don't just do this, understand it first :-)

Unfortunately, thats only if you compare raw processor work, and then not 
even then. "A 486-33" covers a wide variety of hardware, from screenless
servers to workstation oriented boxes. My lowend SPARC embaresses 486-33

of IO and graphics work. Horses for courses.....

I don't see what is wrong with it.  It lets you do anything you want with 
the (running) system - no holds barred.  A system without it would be 
crippled as far as I am concerned.  I realize that the object of this 
thread is to come up with a better method, so I am anxious to hear what an
alternative solution is.

Sure, you can't strip it, but it is a nifty way to patch a running kernel.

I have seen quite a few posts against /dev/kmem.  I don't think it will make
it into the release.  If that is what the world wants, so be it.

With all the excitement over planned ports of X11 to Linux, has anyone

less taxing in disk space and memory than X, and should be much easier to 
port, too - although not so easy that I could do it, I'm afraid :)

I believe you are using the wrong libc.a. Once again, this is due to the fact
that the ftp sites are not organized in a way a newcomer can start without
problems (I guess that is what "beta" means). I believe,
you need to get libc-0.12.a. About floating point support, wait for a new
release of gcc (with new set of libraries as well) from hlu@coea.wsu.edu
soon (hopefully :-)

I think you have an 0.11 libc. Those functions are in the 0.12 libc.
To be sure, get the sources and build your own.

Hi! I couldn't find the UK keyboard anywhere so I wrote my own (well, enough to
let me program :-)) and I came up against something I find a little odd....

.... Above the 3 on a UK keyboard is a pound sign (ascii decimal 156). If I
give this key as .byte 156 in keyboard.S I get something that looks remarkably
like ascii 28.... is Linux using 7 bit only? What about the extended character
set characters i.e.

Q. How do you get ascii 128 or greater from the keyboard?

Next question....

I have a fixed serial line between my machine at home and my flat-mates machine
(DOS). We can successfully manage link-ups at up to 38400 baud but we get
garbage above that. I tried increasing the buffer size from 1024 bytes (yes I
did change tty_io.c as well) and I got a resounding hang when I rebooted with
my new image. So....

Q. Is 115200 baud possible and if so, how?

Next question.....

Over the last few days I seem to have been having some weird keyboard problems
which I don't see in DOS. Basically, all three led's come on out of the blue
and sometimes the system hangs when it does this :-( This doesn't appear to be
due to the keyboard driver changes I've made 'cos it does it even with the US
keyboard. Any ideas?

Nearly done...

.... Where can I find the port of the select system call 'cos I seem to have
missed it on all the archives (can't get on to nic.funet last few attempts). I
know that there is most of a select call in the linux kernel sources.... is
this what everyone is using?

Oak video bios support..... anybody got any? My card will support most things
up to 132x60 but linux boot up doesn'y want to let me at 'em. Any hacks anyone?

And finally..... hard disk boot ups..... I want to boot from hard disk (i.e. no
floppies involved) and bootany looks nicer than shoelace for what I need. How
and where do I put the image file from a kernel make and how do I tell bootany
? What do I call the image?

Thanks,
      Iain

These are math helper functions, and you can usually compile these
programs to use the kernel floating point routines by adding '-m80387'
to the compiler switches. If the program does any wierd fp math (exp(),
sin()) it'll die when you run it though.

This should be in the FAQ (hi Marc :-), by the way, where is the FAQ? I
haven't seen one in a long time.

There's no objection to /dev/kmem per se.  It's useful to be able to
run a debugger against the running system, for example.  My problem is
with using it for "ps" and other programs like that.  I object to
having application programs have to know the internal data structures
of the kernel.  It's true that this could be implemented in a library.
You could read /dev/kmem, but have the library know about the data
structures.  Thus when you change kernels, all you'd have to change
would be the library, not all the application programs.  In theory I'd
accept this.  But I have two warnings (1) you're talking about more
than Sun's libkvm.  Libkvm handles certain data structures, but by no
means all of those used by common applications.  Thus many kmem
readers are still dependent upon kernel variable names and data
structures (2) this would require sharable libraries, which is itself
a fairly complex facility.  I like sharable libraries conceptually,
and they're useful under SunOS.  But it's by no means clear to me
that they are necessary for a small system like linux.
