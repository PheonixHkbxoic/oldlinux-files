I've compiled (and linked without fatal errors) the mylogin3 package. This 
Works well except i have a minor problem,... it's not running as a gettty
has anyone been able to  spawn 'login' from this package (on tsx-11.mit.edu)
onto other tty's.. currently i run it from the /etc/rc file (ok very bad idea)
but i cannot run /bin/doshell /dev/tty1 /bin/login & as this simply throws
login into the back of processing allowing the rc to complete and run a root
shell
        On top of this, when i login, the system refuses to let me run another
shell on tty2 (i'm root?). I was going to use the qpl package but found that
it refused to compile (_free_s and _ttyname (yes i did put them in the include)
). Anyway, the grieving aside, has anyone (poe?) found an elegant way around
this?
        Just another thing, linux kernel paniced last night.... disk i/o error
in 0302 (hur hur hur, mirth, snigger), I found that sector 6 offset form the
partition had become bad (after running norton's calibrate at 80 int. through
the disk before starting to port linux,... so much for the kernel panic, you
should have seen me at this stage!.. anyway to cut a long story short, i found
that writting sector 6 back from nortons 'de' in maint mode, cured the problem.
the thing is, that I was getting HDtimout errors for a while which manifested
itself -> panic over a 3 day period then the weird linux debug *P=null and
then the system failure (i've and ide, 386sx 16 mhz) luckily sector 6 was blank
in the first place but i doubt that this would be the case everytime.

Subject: SWAP device during config and swapon
Date: 12 Feb 92 19:35:50 GMT


   I applied some various patches to Linux 0.12 circulating at the download
sites and was wondering what I should do to rebuild.  There's a SWAP_DEV
define in the top Makefile that wants a device name.  There's an add-on
called swapon that's been posted that allows you to specify a file instead
of a HD partition for Linux to swap to (with this, you 'turn on' swapping
after bootup with a special ioctl, passing it the file to use as swap space).
Is it possible to specify anything for SWAP_DEV (or nothing?), use the swapon 
to direct swapping to a file and the SWAP_DEV will be totally ignored?  
Thanks for the assurrance.

Hi,

Some time ago there was a posting (by Mr. Drew Eckhardt I believe)
mentioning that someone was working on or had finished a low level
SCSI driver for DTC adapters. Does anyone know the status of this
project?

The reason I'm asking is that I'm stuck with a DTC3280A and I want
to know if I have to spend a considerable amount bying an Adaptec
in order to get started with Linux.

So is somebody out there thinking of including a DTC driver in
Linux 0.13?

Thanks,

        I've just heared about this Linux system and it sounds great to me.
But how do one install it? I've read an INSTALL-0.12 file, but it doesn't say
what files to put on the floppy and how to make this floppy bootable.

        As you can see I don't know much about "Unix system management" so
perhaps I should just wait for version 1.0 and hope the installation is easier?

Have you read the INSTALL-0.11 file?  It contains more detail.  At any
rate, to boot Linux, you have to prepare two disks.  One of them will
contain a "boot" image, and the other the "root" image.  You will use
the boot image to (as the name implies) boot your system.  After
booting from the boot image disk, you will be asked to insert the root
image disk.  The root image contains enough of Linux's file structure
to get you going.  If you successfully boot from boot, and then insert
root, you will be running Linux, but from a floppy.  The instructions
in INSTALL-0.11 contain clear instructions for transfering the system
to a HD.

To create the two disks, you need a program that writes directly to
the disks (bypassing the MS-DOS file structure).  "rawrite" is such a
program.  So, download the boot and root images onto your PC (in
BINARY mode, of course), format two disks, and then use rawrite.
Rawrite will ask you the name of the file you want to transfer, and
the disk to write it is to be transferred.

Then your set to go.

Enjoy!

Some people will argue that you may want to reboot a malfunctioning 
system which you realize has just corrupted your superblock. In this
case you DO NOT want to sync the disks before rebooting. 
SunOS does this by doing
        
        for (i=10,n=1;(i>0) && (n > 0);i--)
            {
            sync ();
            printf ("%d ",n=number_of_unflushed_buffers ());
            sleep (1);
            }

This is quite effective. If possible the system will write the disks, and 
continue shutdown within a second. Max timeout is about a second.

Be careful with sync() and sleep() in kernel/interrupt routines.

It should be possible to just run /bin/login at the end of /etc/rc. This
is only a stopgab measure until we get a *real* init.

I'm not sure what you mean by that. Could you clarify a bit?

I'm working on both a getty program (based upon agetty posted to
comp.sources.misc awhile back) and an init. The getty program seems almost 
done, and works rather well.

Last night I coaxed the qpl-init thing to work with getty and login, but
qpl-init is rather messy, and I might (given time) try to rewrite it from
scratch.

As an aside: The problem with free_s in qpl-init stems from the inclusion 
of the kernel include files. Remove the lines with #include <linux/....>
and everything seems to work fine. This has also been discussed before.

I think there are two main points:

1) only root should have access to ctrl-alt-del.

2) the reboot routine should not be hard-coded into the kernal.

For drastic problems, there's always the power switch....

Well, I decided to sit down and get Linux properly installed on my machine

following problem....

I've got everything into roughly the correct place and I thought I'd better try
a "Hello World" program to test the compiler.... how do you do this with the
wrong national keyboard? #define comes out as \define and "Hello World" becomes
@Hello World@.... I thought I had to edit and recompile somethings for this to
work..... could be a little tricky..... how's it done?

Plea for clear instructions:
I have to recompile some bits and pieces  (I think) to install mtools and a
national keyboard. Asuuming the compile goes ok, what do I do then? Do I just
reboot and all will magically work?

Thanks in advance,

I've got the mylogin3 package up and running on my machine, and it
works. Unfortunately, along with the problems with make and such already
reported, I've run into a problem with the program who, included in the
mylogin3 package.

If I'm logged in as other than root, who fails, reporting

_setutent: Can't open utmp: not owner

Presumably meaning I'm not the owner. I'm not so hot at sysadmin, but
does this have to do with setuid on the binaries? Isn't who supposed to
be able to read utmp no matter whom called it? Whats the fix?

As a related note, kermit reports ENOACCESS errors on /dev/tty65
presumably because it can't open that either because of the permissions.
I guess I have a lot of work to do before I can get other accounts doing
usefull work.

If these are dumb questions, please slap me in the face, then put them
in the FAQ, we're going to need them answered.

As I said in an earlier posting, when I tried to copy partitions via:
"tar cvf - foo bar | (cd blech; tar xf -)"
it hung my system as well.  It copied a few files, then the disk stopped
being accessed and everything just sat there.  Sounds like the same
problem.

What tools are folks using to debug kernel problems?  There is no adb or
even ps yet, so what do you do?  dd from /dev/mem and disassemble?  kernel

Just because of this type of thing, the current pager does /NOT/ page
out dirty pages with a reference count of > 1. This means that the pager
won't have to be modified for things like shared memory or applications
like this (in addition, a page with physical address < LOW_MEM (1M)
won't be swapped out anyway).

So the (very easy) solution is to copy the function put_dirty_page() in
mm/memory.c, and add some additional checks (check that the page isn't
put over an old one, remove the check that mem_map[page] should always
be 1, etc etc), and everything should work all right. You seem to
understand the problems (note that pages < LOW_MEM don't have reference
counters, they are considered to be sacred to the kernel, so freeing
them won't actually free anything etc).

Reply-To: B.J.Lippolt@research.ptt.nl

I just brought up Linux v0.12 (BTW. great fun, much better than trying to
get Minix from v1.1 to v1.5.10). I have some questions about partition
sizes though. I have two disk of 106Mb each of which I use the second for
Linux. I partitioned it with edpart.exe into three pieces of 6Mb, 12Mb and
88Mb. When I boot Linux and run fdisk it tells me I got partitions
/dev/hd7, /dev/hd8 and /dev/hd9 (I don't know why I don't have hd6; I had
one DOS-partition of 106Mb which I deleted with edpart and then I created
three new partitions, maybe hd6 got lost in that process).
The "mkfs -c /dev/hd7 6410" did succeed, but "mkfs -c /dev/hd9 88380"
didn't. Mkfs just gives the 'Usage' message. When I tried a blockvalue 
of 65536 mkfs gave the error message "can't open /dev/hd9". What's 
happening here? I've read in the FAQ that mkfs cannot handle large partitions,
but it doesn't mention any sizes. How large can a Linux partition be?

A related question: what are the best sizes for the root-partition
and the swap-space? My only experience is with SunOS and that tells me
I need about 6Mb for root and 20+ Mb for swap. Seems somewhat exaggerated
for Linux I would say.

Thanks for any info.

Hi,
  I know it has been probably been brought up before, but I was wondering
about Ethernet connections becomming supported some time in the future.
     
  I saw recently that tcp was finally working, but for only a SLIP
connection. I realize that in order to support ethernet, you would need
packet drivers for about every type of card that is available.

  Is there somebody working on this?  If not, can somebody point me
in the right direction in order to start finding out what would have to
be done to implement it.  Either post or feel free to e-mail me.

  I am helping set up Unix environments on pc's at the University of
Nebraska, and right now they're using SCO xenix, which I am totally
unimpressed with.  I have played around with Linux and would really like
to get it running.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

Does this mean that there  is a device driver for the Adaptec now?
I'd like to get Linux running, but don't have an ST-506 drive.

Subject: .Z files, VMS and downloads...
Date: 14 Feb 92 05:11:00 GMT


   I've been having intermittent problems downloading .Z files with ftp.
When I uncompressed them and tried to untar them, they'd work fine until the
last file; then I'd get an error message something like "only read xxxx bytes
from file yyyyy".

   It's taken some time to find this one, but it seems to stem from the fact
that our site runs VMS (no flames, please; I feel the same way). As far as I
can tell, when I ftp a file from somewhere, VMS pads it out to a multiple of
512 bytes with nulls. When I turn uncompress loose on a file which has extra
nulls at the end, it often seems to get upset and fill the end of the file
with rubbish. This is what upsets tar.

   My usual procedure is to ftp the file to the VAX, download it to MS-DOS
with sz, then transfer it to linux with mtools. The question is, then, is
there something I've missed? I can't believe I'm the first person in the world
to get this problem! (Oh yes, I did remember to set "type i" for the ftp
transfer). If it's really a simple question, you'll have to pardon me; I'm
not used to this stuff.

I missed the fix for vixie cron (to prevent zombie crond's) - could
some one please mail it to me?

Along the same lines, has anyone patched the kernel to look for zombies, 
and make either init or swapper their parent, so they can be killed?

Linux is initialized on my 486/33 PC.

It was pretty easy, the only problems I had were self-inflicted
due to my box's history.

The boot went fine, the root copy was OK.  I have to poke the boot image
to get the hard disk to be the boot device (I will require booting Linux
from floppy since my stock and trade is DOS on this machine), then 
copy over the remainder of the hierarchy.

Screen updates are very fast.  I'm pleased so far, it's been a while
since I've bootstrapped an OS an a new target.

I don't have any specific plans except to fix things that annoy me and
post them to the group; perhaps import a new shell or other stuff
that I think are amusing.  X11R5 would be deluxe but I'll wait for
someone with more time than I have to complete THAT port.

Oh, the problem: I have a Plus HardCard 105, which requires a DOS
driver for it to live.  I initially tried to install Linux on it but
Linux could not write to it.  So I did some file shuffling and 
repartitioned my other IDE drive (Quantum 105MB).  It was something I've
needed to do anyway so I now have a nice clean DOS boot/root/bin and
a reorg-ed work drive.

Subject: Help!  Can't boot!


I've been trying to get linux to run on my Zeos 486, but I can't seem to
get it to even boot up!  When I boot up with the rawrited bootimage it
just hangs after reading the disk for a second or two.  When I tried
rawriting from a PS/2 it would boot and then go into a loop displaying
what looked like:

ax 123
bx 141
cx 34235
dx 0914


or something like that - over and over again.  Any suggestions???

Subject: Problems: Kermit & SVGA?
From: hamilton@csc.wcc.govt.nz
Date: 14 Feb 92 21:02:40 +1200

     
Linux works just fine on a HP QS20 386DX 20MHz, with a QUANTUM PRODRIVE 84
MB IDE drive.  A very nice piece of work.  Two problems:

The SVGA modes don't work (physical display does't change to the requested
mode), HP seems to be using a Headland Video-7 (perhaps with some HP mods). 
Anyone with a Video-7 got similar problems.  A friend with an unidentified SVGA
card has the same problem.

I've noticed that unless I do a cold reboot (i.e. toggle the power or reboot /c
from DOS), /dev/tty64 no longer responds to 
        kermit -l /dev/tty64  

A memory initialisation problem?  Various incantations of stty didn't appear
to help.

Suggested option for a reboot/shutdown command: -c or +cold_boot

Failing any other simple fix, can some PC guru tell me how to alter keyboard.S
to do a cold reboot, I believe the line to change is: 
        movw $0x1234,0x472      /* don't do memory check */

I had the same problem when I tried out Linux on a PS/2 at school.
Perhaps there's some sort of compatibility problem.  (PS/2 isn't
compatible with the rest of the world....:-)).  The same disk that
wouldn't boot from a PS/2 runs fine on my Dell.
