Hi netters/linuxers:

first my system configuration:

  I have a 486DX with 8M memory and 200M hard disk. It also has a SVGA (1MB)
  adapter but (currently) only a EGA monitor. BTW, this one is made by Gateway
  2000 and comes with the "anykey" programmable key board. My disk is
  partitioned into 21M, 21M, 21M and rest as part of intallation of Minix
  1.5.10 from PH. The 21M partitions are minix partitions the large remaining
  is DOS. I use /dev/hd2 (21M) as my root device for Linux. Currently, thanks
  to  shoelace, I can boot Linux of my hard drive. 

Now questions:

  1) I cannot reboot my system by cntl-alt-del. I tried this with the 
     system (I mean kernel/root images) obtained from tsx-11.mit.edu
     as well as the one I compiled my self with gcc. I bet there is some one
     who knows why. (BTW, I programmed my keyboard to swap shift and cntrl key.
     But both cntrl-alt-del and shift-alt-del does not work. This also happens
     with minix.) At this point I am inclined to ask - How about a system call
     like reboot/shutdown to linux?

  2) There are several patches available at tsx-11.mit.edu for faster floppy
     operations, lp device and init/login. Is there a particular order in
     which these patches should be applied? Are these patches tested or are
     they to be tested/fixed?

  3) Is there a ps available for linux?


I appreciate your answers either as postings or as e-mail(ramesh@utdallas.edu).

Thanks.

Ramesh

Right.  There must be smaller parts available, but each must be self-sufficient

Yes, there is an absolutely right place.  We just have to create it.
Obvisously, cat, dd, and related programs belong in /bin.  mtools, less,
and relatives belong in /usr/local/bin.  Now, do we cross-link /usr/bin and
/bin like SunOS has done?  Do we put all "required-to-run-single-user" binaries
in /sbin?  I would like to form a mailing list of people that are interested
in helping out in setting some standards for directory locations.  The current
state of affairs *MUST NOT CONTINUE*

With the current state of affairs, I am almost 100% sure that nobody has the
exact same file structure!  I have created a file system mirror on
banjo.concert.net in ~ftp/pub/Linux/Release with what I think the file system
should look like.  Please look it over!  It holds all sym-links to make 
the system run, as well as all binaries that I could find, and source moved
into what I believe to be the correct places.

>I think that everyone who is porting something should include a readme-file
>to tar file. That would contain information about location or something
>like that. 

Yes.  Every tar file should contain information on where the binaries and
source should live.  Many of the current binary distributions were created
from the file system root (tar cf thing.tar /usr/bin/thing*) and that is *NOT*
acceptible [IMHO, of course].

We have to created a standard environment for the common locations for
files, and it needs to occur soon.. [before 0.13??]

Please contact me via e-mail if you wish to have input on the formation of
standardized places and standardized methods of file distribution.

I think the bug about 387 is all the floating point exceptions are
masked out. It may cause trouble for some math routines. I am still
testing the 387 support.

Beside the kernel, the compiler doesn't support 387. I found some
strange things, like

1) double foo = 1.2234E34;
does not work. Gcc translates it to foo = 1.2234.

2) foo = 0.0/0.0 hangs. No error reported. Is that a compiler bug or
kernel bug?

I am going to compile a new gcc and libc.a with 387 support. The
current gcc and libc.a stink with 387. I hope I can finish it by this
week. I will build a full libm.a for 387 and may add some entries to
libc.a, like getpass (), etc. Any suggestions?

BTW, has anyone added the system call, rename (), to libc.a? I'd like
to have it in my libc.a.

After some testing, I will put them on the ftp sites. For the machines 
with 387, it may need to recompile some programs. Because the kernel
has to be modified to get 387 support, some programs may not run very
well. I hope that will not be the case. I will test it first. Even if
old programs works fine, recompile them is still a good idea to take
advantage of 387.

Hi,

I added your fd patches. It seems to work fine with tar. For the same
1.44 mb disk, first I used

        format /dev/fd0
        mkfs /dev/fd 1440
        mount /dev/fd0 /mnt

then
        cd /mnt
        tar xvofz /tmp/linux.tar.Z

When I tried to edit some files, it gave me lots of read errors. Do you
have any idea about this? A few files were read fine though.

Thanks.

Did you install the second set as well? The first one (fd.tar.Z) broke
when it tried to start a read on track 1 (I had forgotten to update
the head in one place). Its possible the announcement didn't get out
on alt.os.linux though because our site has been having news feed problems.
Unfortunitly these started the day after I cancelled my subscription to
linux-activists :(
The other one is named fpatch.tar.Z, this one also fixs the problem of
multivolume restores not working.

Subject: possible bug somewhere...
Date: 27 Jan 92 19:03:08 GMT


When I was installing linux, I was doing the copy from root floppy to
my new root-partition-to-be on hd3 and thought, "Gee, this is taking
awhile.  Good chance to test job-control."  So I ^Z'd it and bg'd it,
and it seemed to run.

When I went to boot from that partition, however, I found that the bash
executable was only partially copied, and that when I tried to re-copy
it, I had the wonderful HD errors that cause the HD to hang and linux
to kernel panic and stop.  This kept happening.  I finally decided to
try the disk under DOS.  Lo and behold, I got sector not found errors
after I repartitioned and reformatted the drive.

My dealer tells me that he extensively tested the drive, which I think
I believe, because I had already sent one (really defective) drive
back.  He said that he has a low-level format utility available
written by toshiba for my IDE drive, and that that should get rid of
the sector not found errors.  If it does, then there is definitely a
bug somewhere -- I am guessing either in the hd device, the buffering
scheme, or job control.  However, I don't have linux working and I
don't know that I am enough of a wizard to find such things, so I am
asking that those who know what is going on check for such a thing.

If the low-level format gets rid of the sector not found errors under
dos, and lets linux use the drive again, I will post again.
Meanwhile, if anyone has any questions about my setup, please email me
and ask.  I can tell you more if you like.

Thanks much.

Is this misfeature going to be addressed soon?  I am about to buy a new, large

partition for Linux, or whether 64M is an absolute maximum (and if it is, I

I think there is an error in the FAQ recently posted.

Byte 509 should have 03, and Byte 508 should have the number of /dev/hdX.

==========
Also for all those wondering how to edit bytes 508,509:
Use YASE.EXE avaliable from the simtel directory <msdos.dskutl>, or
from uk.ac.ic.doc.src (146.169.3.7).

Got to Sector 0 (It starts up here anyway) and then use the h,j,k,l keys
so that the offset number says 1fc (which is 508) and put in the num of your
/dev/hdX, then move to 1fd (509) and put in 03..... et Voila!

One has to change the kernel.  The file linux/kernel/chr_drv/tty_io.c has the
base addresses set for the serial ports.  These are the first values in the 
tty_que structure (data), and are set near the top of tty_init - besure to 
change for both the send and recieve halves, ie there are two of the same
entries for each COM port.


COM ports are base address 3f8 2f8 3e8 and 2e8 for COM1,2,3,4 respectively.

Interrupts are set in the serial.c rs_init function, and are equal to
0x20 + the IRQ number.

Note that these can be combined to provide non standard configurations, and
that more serial ports may be added if needed.  Also note that since 
COM1, 3 and 2,4 share the same IRQ line, they cannot be used at the same time
as the unmodified serial drivers enable interrupts for all serial ports present
- which will short things out (not as bad as it sounds) if more than one device
is generating interrupts on a given IRQ line (AT bus - the PS/2 bus uses 
a different setup where multiple interrupts are OR'd together, and the
system is set up to use a level active as opposed to edge triggered 
interrupt so that multiple devices CAN share an IRQ line if the software 
allows for it_)

There's no reason why you couldn't do some combination.  Apple's
Macintosh Unix, for example, comes with /dev/tty0 and /dev/tty1 for the
unixheads used to cryptic codes, and /dev/modem and /dev/printer for
the macheads used to cute icons (which also appear next to the serial
port sockets.)  As long as they have the same major & minor device
numbers, things are hunky dory.  A/UX uses this as an aid to
configuration as well:  UUCP comes with /dev/modem and /dev/tty0 (the
same device) configured different ways.

DOS  : the segmented architecture really screws things up.  You can 
get djg++ running, and compile a gas that outputs 386 native code for 
that in the standard a.out format you need, along with the 
other gnu binutils.

Other operatings systems : mostly, it depends on the ENDIAN of the machine.
Other little ENDIAN machines are quircky to deal with, but they do
work.  I've done some things (not an entire kernel) on a decstation 5500 - 
with gcc compiled as a cross compiler, gas as a cross assembler, and the 
gnu binutils set up with the right include files.  

The only problem I ran into was that gld running on the DEC often garbled
things.  All other utilities worked fine.

Another 386 Unix would be ideal.  Just remeber to use the Linux 
libraries, etc when linking.

Big Endian machines will be able to run gcc, but you'll have to stop at
.s files - as although gas CAN supposedly correct for differebt hst / target 
endians, in reality it scrambles the bit fields.

Also, whatever you use, be sure that the makefiles are using your 
386 Linux target utilities.

Theoretically.  Some cross compilations are easier than others.
