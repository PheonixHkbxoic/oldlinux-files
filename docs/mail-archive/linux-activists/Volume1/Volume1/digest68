Bad floppy disk.  Sector 1, track 4, head 0 not found.

Solution : 

Reformat the floppy disk.

   I just fixed a FP bug in gnulib, a bug in sqrt(0.0) of libsoft.a and put
   a new newgcc.tar.Z on tsx-11.mit.edu.

It's since been installed in ~ftp/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/newgcc.tar.Z.

I've also taken the time to process all of the uploaded files that have
hit ~ftp/incoming in the past few days.  To make things easier on me
(I've been fairly time-crunched at work lately), I'd appreciate it if:

        * People at least their name, and preferably their email
        addresses as well in README files.  A date is a good thing,
        too.

        * README files --- please!  Ideally there should be a README 
        file bundled in the tar file, and ideal it has been bundled up
        by doing "tar cvf ../foo.tar *", since that will make sure that
        the README file is one of the first files in the tar file,
        which makes things easier for me when I try to figure out what
        the heck it is you've uploaded.

        * Please send me tar files, or compressed tar files.  While I 
        can deal with other formats, it's less convenient for me,
        and I can't be sure other people can deal with them.

        * If you want something processed fast, please send me mail
        describing what you've uploaded and what names you've used.
        If you don't send me mail, it may take a couple of days
        before I find time to scan the incoming directory.

Thanks!  The easier it is for me to process something, the faster it
will make it out there....
