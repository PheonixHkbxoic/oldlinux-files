I've seen this once before, but don't remember ever seeing

I agree that cawf is OK for normal man pages (though I had to add a
definition for the SS macro).  However Berkeley is now using a
different package, mandoc.  Does anyone know of a macro definition
file for mandoc that works with cawf?

I think it would be best to have all the stuff (at least sources) file
by file. Then you could browse around in the directories and get what
you need. If you want whole packages, you can use the special features
of the ftp server in nic. Quote from the /README file:

Let's face it. A V86 mode is almost useless.
What kind of programs (decent programs) do you see that use an 8086 ?
( That's a V86 mode ).....
If you are not using the V86 mode then you have to start to catch
interrupts, look for memory access amnd all dirty stuff.
It seems to me that people underestimate the complexity of building
an almost buf free OS.

If you and other people like to live with a DOS type OS ( That also 
crashes quite often ) well..... I see a sorrow end for Linux.

Yes. I agree with this BUT there are other things FIRST.
Linux is not "standard" yet. In the sense that the math emulation in the
kernel is not finished ( And math emulation relly has to be in kernel )

The OS in general has very little problems in compatibility that make you
do some changes in the source code of PD programs to make them compile and
run. 

This has to be fixed. MM and the rest can wait.

Again, kernel bigger ( probably 4mb ram will not be enought anymore )
Errors around.... For what ? To play with DOS ?
Remembar that DOS is not so clean. Not only you have do deal with DOS
but with all the rubbish of Extended Expanded EMM .....
If your emulator is not EQUAL to DOS then you DOS program will hang.

Do you want DOS to hang in the middle of you wordprocessor ?
I don't

The fact of the matter is that there are many good DOS programs:
WordPerfect and Quicken come immediately to mind.  While I don't
actually use WP and more, I know many people that do, and I'd like to be
able to use Linux without giving up such nice DOS programs.  Most
programs still run under a simple 8086.  I also have several games for
DOS that I simply cannot port to Linux.  (Scrabble, Chess, etc.)

If the DOS emulator dies it's not nearly to critical as if the OS
dies.  Under Linux, everything else will keep running.  Not SO bad....

As I have moved toward software emulation in the kernel, things have
generally gotten slower: I never even tried to make my soft-float
routines fast (did you get the right results?) - my feeling was that
anybody who wanted math-capabilities beyond a few adds etc would have a
387 or 486. The kernel emulation doesn't make things faster: it just
makes it /easier/, as you never need care about the existence of the
387.

In fact the current math-emulation is probably pessimal when it comes to
the speed of things like 'sin()' etc: I'd guess sin and other more
complicated functions use the emulator add/mul to calculate the results,
so when calculating sin you get /a lot/ of the math-not-present
exceptions.  Things will probably get /a bit/ better when all the
commands are inside the kernel (not trapping all the time), but even
then I'd suggest you get a math-coprocessor if you intend to calculate a
lot: I wouldn't be the least surprised to see much more than >10x
performance gains if you use sin etc extensively.

Actually, I have a 20MHz SX at home without a coprocessor, and a 16MHz
SX with a coprocessor at work. I compiled a program with libsoft and
libm, and tested the libsoft compiled program at home. 50 iterations in
3 minutes (it does many ldexp's). At work, off of a floppy disk, the
same program, 50 iterations in less than a second.

Interestingly, I can't tell the difference between the libsoft and libm
linked programs on the machine with the coprocessor. They both run just
as fast. Do libsoft linked programs use the coprocessor when present?

You are seriously underestimating the useability of V86 mode.  The DOS
memory manager QEMM uses V86 mode to provide all sorts of loadhigh features
and memory management services.  This broke programs that tried to switch
into protected mode and do their own memory management, but it was so
popular that most programs were re-written to include VCPI support (which
allows them to work with or without QEMM being present).  These days you
also have to support DPMI so you can run Windows 3.0 without resorting to
real mode.  Look at OS/2 2.0 -- they are providing an OS that uses V86
dos boxes complete with DPMI (and I believe VCPI) support, so it CAN be
done.  Don't think that it's going to be easy, though.

Date: 27 Feb 92 14:58:27 GMT

I had a look at shoelace before but didn't like the look of it but would like
to boot completely from my hard disk (disabling floppy seek makes a big
difference to my boot up speed). I played around with bootany (a boot record
replacement which looks as though it will do the job) but, on experimentation
it successfully booted up into dos but couldn't boot linux. This wan't really
surprising because it had no image to tell it what to do. In the makefile for
linux (kernel) there is a disk: entry which I use to build an image for floppy
boot up. How do I get this into the appropriate place in my partition from
within the standard makefile? With a full backup I tried changing the dd etc
/dev/PS0 to dd etc /dev/hd3 and successfully attacked the kernel (in a fatal
and unpleasant way) so I would guess that this isn't the way to do things :-).

So...... the question is.....

In the disk entry in the main makefile a) what do I write and b) where do i
write it (i.e. which tools with which parameters?)

Many thanks,
           Iain

p.s. How many blocks on a 1.44 HD disk? I thought I remembered it being 1440
but tar lost data with this (tar -L 1440 -Mzpf /dev/PS0 as a backup strategy)

Sadly, VCPI will NOT run with OS/2 v2.0.  You are quite right about
DPMI, however.  I have heard that Phar Lap (DOS extender people) will
rewrite their extender to use DPMI, so new apps using that extender
will run under OS/2.  I have found that while noticably slower than
under DOS, Lotus 123 v3.1 runs quite nicely under the DOS box of OS/2.
V86 machines *can* produce a very usable DOS environment.

Hi,

        I've successfully got the floppy system up and gathered up the disk partitioning
programs, but there are two things I have questions about:

1. A viable way to patch the bootimage. Can this be done via debug on the DOS side. Can
someone give a reasonably simple description of the procedure.

2. Assuming I get the root filesystem up on hd, I'm somewhat confused as to how to
go about bring over the other tools. Mtools is not part of the rootimage. Here's what
I'm doing:
                a. Download to a Sun SPARCstation.
                b. Write the file to a DOS floppy on the Sun
                c. Take it home and copy it on to the DOS side of my PC.

Now here is where I'm confused. It sounds as though (reading the Install + Release notes)
that I can use rawrite to write the files back to floppy and then get at them from the Linux side.
This sounds supicious to me. If true, is the floppy a DOS floppy, or a floppy with a Linux filesystem
on it. I assume there is SOME way to do this or else mtools would be on the rootimage.

Thanks for any and all help
