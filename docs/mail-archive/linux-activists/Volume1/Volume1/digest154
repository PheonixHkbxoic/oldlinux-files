  mkfs problems in 0.95a (William A Jones)

Last night I obtained the linux 0.95a bootimage and rootimage from
tsx-11.  Linux will boot from my floppy but I get HDtimeout (roughly
10 times) followed by I/O error and "Unable to read partition on
device 0300"  followed by the same messages as it tries to access my
second harddisk.

The root system is running fine from the floppy drive.  fdisk tells me
about one partition on my C: drive (which I want to remain DOS) and
one on my D: drive (currently DOS but which I want to devote to
linux).  The partition sizes and types are correct.  I then run "mkfs
/dev/hdb1 43529 (I think)" and am told that linux is unable to write
the file system.  The error that shows up here has varied each time I
have run mkfs but it seems to have something with not finding the
partition table.

My system is about as vanilla as you can get.  I'm running a

DTK 386SX-16 with 5mb
2 Seagate HD's : 1239A (drive C:)
                 st251-1A (drive D:)
1.2 mb floppy.

I don't know what to do about this.  Once upon a time linux-0.12 ran
just fine, created a filesystem, and mounted /usr on D: with no
problems.  I foolishly erased those images.  I'll go back to version
0.12 if I have to but I would prefer to run 0.95a.  I've checked the
FAQ but all it implies is that is fdisk works then mkfs works.
Obviously that's not the case.  Any assistance will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Bill
