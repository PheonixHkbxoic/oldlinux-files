I have a primary Linux partition, a primary OS/2 partition, and an extended
logical DOS partition. I am able to access my OS/2 partition using mtools
(although I get garbage because it was formatted with HPFS) but I cant
seem to access my logical dos partition (drive D:). Is this normal?
is mtools not supposed to be able to access these?

Sometimes when by mistake I cat a binary file to the screen, it will leave
Linux in a weird mode, all the characters typed or displayed from then on
are weird (from ascii 128 to  256). The only way to get out of this is to
reboot. Any ideas how I can reset my terminal to the regular characters?

Subject: Perl 4.019 on Linux 0.12, problems with $&...
Date: 4 Feb 92 16:00:24 GMT

I'm attempting to get perl up and running on my 386/33 running linux 0.12,
using gcc 1.40 (the compiler that comes with linux).

After getting through configure, and doing various small hacks in the
makefile, I have got it to compile cleanly, except for minor warnings about
return-types of getgrgid() and such.

But problems arise when I run the test-suite. First I must say that floating
point support on linux is fairly bad, so I get several failed tests because
sprintf prints - for instance - 12 as 11.99999999997.

This can be remedied by compiling with these options, in effect making an
"integer-perl":

        -Ddouble=int -Datof=atoi -DINT_PERL

and then doing some minor hacks in str.c and dolist.c to get proper conversions
from ints to strings, and removing packing of floats and doubles.

With these hacks I get fewer failed tests than with the original floatin-point
perl.

BUT , in both cases the produced perl fails on tests:  op/pat 28,29,30

I seems that $& doesn't get set correctly. Why can this happen??
This problem also affects several other tests.
At least in op/pat test #28 $& is set to the empty string or null...

Another failure that seems to occur only with "integer-perl" is that the
test: comp/<something...> fails, due to length('\\\\') not returning 2
or, more accurately:

(length('\\\\') == 2)   ==> false

but

$x = length('\\\\'); print $x;  ==> prints 2

and

print length('\\\\');   ==> prints 2

I have tried these things both with and without the perl-malloc if that
matters.


Suggestions anyone?


Thanks in advance.

Reads on standard Unix pipes always return right away if one or more
characters are available, without necessarily satisfying the whole read.
I've tried this at least on System V.2, 4.3 BSD, and research v10.

If Linux pipes don't work this way, they're broken.

I think the most useful way to have tubes work would be to preserve
write boundaries on reads.  I.e., if the writer writes 10 bytes, the
reader would get only ten bytes.  Among other things, this makes it
possible to write "eof"s by writing 0 bytes.  Useful when pretending
to be a terminal.

Very few programs in Unix have trouble with this (default, and unchangable)
behavior in Unix pipes.  The reason is the stdio library takes care of
dealing with partially fulfilled reads in the proper way.  Such programs
can just use fread() and they'll work properly.

>Write also has several possibilities:

I think it would be even better to try to preserve "write boundaries"
no matter how large the writes are.  Difficult, though.

>TU_FS- file system requests passed on to server 

Does this mean file system requests are turned into formatted data messages,
and then passed to the server as a sort of remote procedure call?  Sounds
like a really good idea.

set it up for pc and then reboot the system I get a message saying that
there is a non-system disk.  But, if I set the jumper up to say that it
is an XT the system reboots fine as DOS and recognizes the hardcard as
D:.  My users guide for my IDE drive states the folling:

  If you are installing two IDE drives, you must designate one
  as the primary, or master drive, and the other as the secondary
  or slave drive.

Well the hardcard is not an IDE drive so I didn't set up the jumper
to designate the IDE as either master or slave drive.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!!!

I think that LINUX would become even more popular if it could work
with and boot from MSDOS filesystems. I've had Minix for quite a while
and its incompatibility with dos partitions has definitely made it
less useful to me. I would really like to be able to switch back and
forth easily between Linux, dos and OS/2.i by booting from an
appropriate diskette.

Linux would become extremely popular if it was easy to write new
file systems: MS-DOS, NFS, AFS, CDROM, WORM, database, etc.  This is 
a core piece of technology missing from all the available Unixes.
It's either impossible or proprietary and very very hard.

This is the biggest problem about compatability right now: linux simply
doesn't work correctly with some drives (mostly slower old drives).  I
haven't got any docs on the controller, so most of the hd-driver has
been "trial and error".  I'll probably get some docs next week, and 0.13

Hi,

I just finished a new gcc compiler and a new set of libraries which are
supposed to solve all the floating point number problems as well as the
problems caused by the brain-damaged estdio. With a 387, you can also
get a full libm.a.

It is working now with a 387. It is supposed to work without a 387
under 0.12 kernel. I need someone to test them on a machine without a
387. I prefer someone who has ftp access and is close to me. If anyone

You've probably already got it, its in util.tar.Z as em. This is a

I was compiling in two windows the other day, and decided to open a file in a
third. The machine, which had been churning along nicely, started to
slow down, and then stopped. I killed the third shell, and waited, and
slowly it started picking up steam again. I have 4mb memory, and no swap

But, after a while (usually running overnight) I can't get any more

I agree with keeping the kernel small.  I've ported several things,
and had little trouble with missing kernel facilities.  I'd just as
soon not have things like System V semaphores, shared memory, etc.
Non-blocking tty I/O is essential to several kinds of applications,
and there will probably be a few other features like that, but I agree
that it's a mistake to put much more in the kernel.

The challenge is going to be to provide some basis for networking
without doubling the size of the kernel.  Is there any chance you can
come up with a way to write TCP outside the kernel without losing
performance badly?  There's a version of KA9Q that is designed to run
as a set of programs outside the kernel.  There's a single server that
acts as a protocol engine.  Applications talk to it rather than making
system calls.  It uses System V shared memory and semaphores to talk
between the processes.  If you could come up with a way to keep the
performance penalty of this down, it might be worth looking at.

I'd like to see priority in 0.13 (and maybe 0.14) put on completing
libc.  In the ports I've done, the main area I've found lacking is in
that area: floating point support in the library (gcc compiles calls
to helper routines that don't exist), and various other random things
like alloca, bcopy/bcmp/bzero, regex, etc.  I suspect we've identified
most of the missing stuff by now, and people have come up with them as
part of the source to various programs they've ported.
