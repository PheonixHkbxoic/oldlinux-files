i've ported dvips and have posted it on my local bbs (703-231-7498) and
will ftp it to tsx-11.mit.edu today, hopefully. it includes an emtex
font library.
   hopefully, ajh will do the same with his port of TeX itself..i'm very
short on disk space.
   yes, a good screen previewer (like emtex's dviscr with it's zooms and
search ability) would be nice. first of all, tho, there needs to be lp
support in the kernel.

Below is a limits.h.  I don't know where it's from -- my include

I didn't throw away any .h files.  Mine works.  Ps is great.

There's an easy fix to the problem.  The first thing to do is to untar
the the old include tarfile.  Now untar the newgcc.  The updated include 
files will overwrite the outdated ones.  I have had no trouble since doing
this.

Another approach may be to catch the int 21 and int 10 calls, and first
emulate those. This will give you the ability to run "well-behaved"
programs. Also screen access speeds will be better than under DOS!
Also this would give you access to the linux filesystem.

Subject: Source for setterm
Date: 17 Mar 92 17:56:57 GMT

Can someone please let me know where the source of setterm is?  I can't
locate it on tsx-11.  If it's part of a package, I haven't figured it out.

Incidentally, I'd like to find source for wc, expr, and crypt.

Also, the stdio.h I have is inconsistent with the newlibc source; the
latter uses iop->_ptr, and my stdio.h has structure elements __rptr and
__wptr.  Where is the stdio.h for newlibc?

Would appreciate any inputs.

I am running .95 on a 386 clone, with no problems.  I do use kermit
with block check 3 since otherwise some errors occur when I'm compiling in 
one window while downloading in another.  The lp patch works nicely;
I want to get the setterm source so that I can end up with a PrtSc capability;
it's really handy when I'm logged into a host over the phone line.

That's not as easy.  Int 21h is a fairly complicate routine.  You want 
to run real DOS for compatability, and emulate the underlying BIOS / 
hardware.

wc can be found in the gnu textutils.  
expr can be found in the gnu shellutils.

see prep.ai.mit.edu for the latest versions.

crypt can be found in the UFC sources, bundled with poe-igl.

setterm - check nic.funet.fi.  It might be in the virtual console patches
for .12.  It was posted to the mailing list - you could check the 
archives.

Now, the rootimage-0.12.Z file is 1.2MB uncompressed.  Pray tell how
do you get all of that onto one 360K floppy?!

Let's use some common sense.  VERY few 386 systems these days come
with a floppy disk drive not capable of at least 1.2MB (otherwise
it is NOT an AT compatible).

By the way, shouldn't the RAM requirement be a RAM + swap space requirement?

Hang on a minute..... I must have missed something here! I have absolutely no
problems that I know of getting mail from anywhere so postings should come to
me (although I appreciate the offer).

I have put together the first part of the guide and will be posting it later
this evening. It covers the use of rawrite and fdisk in I hope full detail with
examples and other info and should be enough to let anyone test whether linux
will work for them. I need feedback on this please. Of great importance (and
still to be added) are possible sources of grief during start-up and possible
solutions so mail me with your experiences.

The guide looks as though it will be quite big when everything is covered so I
had a think about it and I propose splitting it into sections so that you have
for example a guide to installation (including shoelace etc), a guide to
getting and installing other software and a guide to basic system maintenance
(backups and things). Each one would contain the info on that topic plus common
problems and solutions. Any thoughts on this?

I will try and start on some partitioning and mkfs stuff
tonight when I repartition my HD (moving swap partition to swap file) but this
is bound to be big so don't hold your breath. I am planning to use edpart 'cos
that's what I've got so I hope this section will cover the following:

- basic ideas of partitions
- creating partitions using edpart (tell me about other progs please)
- Installing to HD
- Booting from floppy -> HD (word at 508 etc)
- Booting entirely from HD using Shoelace (yuck!) or some alternative (if
  anyone has any)
- And of course, common problems.

I might also cover national keyboards here 'cos I suppose that's part of
installation too but I'm not sure.

Till later then,

Iain
