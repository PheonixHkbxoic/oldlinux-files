I, too, tried to run the pre-compiled version of mtools without
success.  But I got it to work by recompiling it from the sources.
I'm using an unpatched 0.12 kernqal, and GCC (of course).  I think the
problem I had was related to the (rather odd) fact that /dev/hd1 seems
unused, /dev/hd2 is my first partition, on which I have DOS, and
/dev/hd3 and hd4 are for Linux.  I have no idea where /dev/hd1 is.  

I also can't seem to get mcopy to work, but mread and mwrite are good
enough.  Mtools is wonderful.

   I was compiling some code, with GCC, and on what looks to me to be 
   a perfectly good piece of code, CC1 complained that:

           The following insn wasn't recognizable
           insn/i 74 73 75 [....]
           [...]

   I didn't write down the rest of the stuff.  (Perhaps a PrtScn under
   Linux would be nice after all.)

   What is an insn?

I think an insn is part of the intermediate language stage of gcc.
The error message you see is a compiler assertion.  It just means that
your version of GCC has something broken in it.  Probably the
architecture description files have some problems.

The best you can do, without becoming a GCC guru, is to rewrite the
code so that you don't generate the same internal representation.
This can be difficult because GCC can be very smart.

   What went wrong?  I've always been more of a Pascal
   person than a C person, so I don't even know if this is a common
   problem I should know about, or something very rare.  Of course, if
   it's the former, please e-mail polite responses without wasting this
   newsgroup's bandwidth any further.

Does any GCC expert know what the problem is in the machine
description?  I have compiled many megabytes of source to SCO Unix
using GCC and G++, and I haven't seen this come up.

This lets you read other folks core images, including file and
tty buffers, which would let you see data that you might not
be authorized for by file protections.

Also, some systems have I/O device registers as an addressable
region of memory.  If you happen to browse one of those locations
you will usually cause a system panic...

hi-
        i've been using emacs successfully for quite a while but i haven't
been able to get the interactive shell capabilities working. i've applied all
the select/nonblock patches which came with the emacs distribution and
others i've found on tsx-11, but the problem has not gone away.

        when i've changed my SHELL variable to point to some program, it
produces output, but reports that the tty is not some device in /dev! i looked
into the emacs sources and the diffs, but could not find anything which would
be screwed up by the patches. i've switched the tty/pty numbers, and obviously
things work to some extent because i can perform a shell-command and this
debugging program does produce output [no input, as this is probably why
bash won't run].

I am having trouble building a version of gcc to cross-compile from a
sparc.  Does anyone have experience building a gcc for cross-compilation?
I'd appreciate you contacting me so I can ask a few questions.

Currently, although gcc built with no errors, the cc1 dies with a SIGSEGV
for some unknown reason.

Thanks,

Subject: mvdir
Date: 20 Feb 92 14:00:01 GMT

Is there supposed to be a mvdir command. I can't get mv to move
directories because there is no /usr/bin/mvdir. I haven't checked the
source yet but this seems to be non-standard. There's no mvdir on the
other machines I use (ULTRIX and SunOS).

I've also had some problems both with elvis and with full screen apps.
Elvis has caused a number of problems, it often exits leaving me stuck
on the bottom line of the screen. If I do an ls or similar, the previous
contents of the screen scroll up but the new info only appears on the
bottom line so it just flashes past in one line bits! Also, when using
vi on other machines through kermit the screen updates are very poor. I
have to do an explicit  after almost everything. This makes me think
that its actually the virtual consoles that are at fault but I'm not
sure.

Where can I get standards documents from. Particularly, POSIX and ANSI C
and ABC file stuff. Which direction is linux going in. I was under the
impression that we were aiming at POSIX/SYSVR4. It seems that this isn't
so clear now. For example, are we going to use the sysv init or not?

OK, finally, some people have suggested forming some structure for linux
development. I think this is urgently needed before thinks really get
too big. There seem to be numerous people working on X now and I think
some more concerted distribution of tasks is needed for all the linux
work. I'm not suggesting that individuals can't stick in their fixes and
mods etc but for major tasks, such as X, mmap, tcp and such we should
establish more organised teams.

This is a very exciting system which has really opened up real unix to
many pc users.

An insn is an internal representation that gcc uses when compiling.  This
is how it works on so many platforms.

         +-----------+               +------------+            +-------------+
         | C code    |------>--------|  insn's    |------->----| assembly    |
         +-----------+               +------------+            +-------------+
                                        `compiler'                  `code generator'

The main part of gcc is to take ordinary c or c++ code, and compile it,
while doing optimisation's etc into insns.  This is hardware and software
independent.  Then, another part which is hardware and os dependent takes
the insns and turns them into that machine's assembly language.

Thus, to port gcc to a new architecture, all you need is the code generator
part.  The error message you have got is because the compiler part has
generated an insn the back end doesn't understand, and can't turn into
80386 assembly.

The fix is to turn off optimisation.  If you still have the problem, wait
for the new linux gcc.

A 486 with big disk is not terribly expensive these days. The Gateway 486/33
with 200MB disk and 8Meg is only $2995. Other clones could be had for a lot
cheaper. I have seen ads for the same configuration at ~$2500.

Workstations are better than PCs in two areas, namely the I/O and displays.
Most of them have a 32 bit I/O bus that would leave the AT bus biting the
dust. But even that can be remedied to a certain extent with the EISA bus
(with SCSI subsystems). You pay a premium of $500 for that now. The Gateway
486/33 is a EISA bus machine with 8MB RAM and 340MB SCSI. Cost: $3845. If
you were to run Linux on that machine, this is your only cost. A 16-inch
monitor would set you back another $600 or so. A similiarly equipped
workstation along with the associated service contracts etc will cost about
1.5 to 2 times as much (The $3995 they quote is either a diskless machine
or a smaller disk).

If I needed the performance, I personally would be willing to buy the 486
EISA with Linux rather than the workstation. I have the benefit of getting
the sources and fixing bugs rather than wait for the supplier to fix it and
charge me additional $$ for a new OS release. With the 486 all my cost is
upfront.  And repairing it is a whole lot cheaper than fixing a workstation.

Hi,

The new gcc 1.40 is officially released. The new gcc supports 387 and
has a better I/O/library.

For those of you with a 387, there is a libm.a which has all math
functions. And there is libsoft.a for those of you without a 387.

There are two files on tsx-11.mit.edu. One is newgcc.tar.Z which has
all the binaries and the header files. Another is newlibc.tar.Z which
has the source codes for the libraries. These libraries are different
from you have now. If you use this gcc, please dump the esdtio.

Some header files will be overwritten by the ones in this package.

Please do read README in newlibc.tar.Z before install it. There are
some information you don't want to miss.

Good luck.
