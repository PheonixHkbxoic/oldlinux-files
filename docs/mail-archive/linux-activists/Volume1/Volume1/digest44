A similar problem is the 64M limit on task space.  I think in general
we would do well to plan ahead, and not limit our options.  If Linux
is to be used even five years from now, we'll have to plan ahead.
IBM's >BIGGEST< mistake with the PC was the 640K mem. limit.  Even
though is was ten times larger than previous models, it quickly became
a major headache.  We don't want this to happen with Linus....

A research group at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay
has "nearly finished" an implementation of Mach from scratch.
They now want to make a Unix run on top of it.

Question 1: Is it a sensible idea to think of taking Linux as a
starting point for this?  What do you think about this vs. other
ways of making a Unix run on Mach?

Question 2: They are not on Internet and I will be mailing
floppies to them.  Should I send v0.12 right now to them or 
should I wait till 0.13?  I looked around the ftp site at MIT and
it felt "a little chaotic".  Is there a single tarfile which I
can just grab from somewhere?

Hi,

I have the following questions which I cannot find the answer in either
the FAQ list or my mail archives.

1. When I tried to make some packages I got many of the following errors:

        Undefined symbol ___XXXsfY referenced from text segment

   where XXX can be neg, mul, cmp, div, or add, and Y can be 2 or 3.
   Did I make any mistakes?

2. When using kermit, I cannot send a BREAK signal by pressing alt-\ B.
   It seems to be a bug.  Any suggestions for me to get a BREAK signal
   sent (so that I can connect to school at 2400 instead of 1200)?

3. The "4 dollar-sign" key on my keyboard is totally dead.  Under MS-LOSS
   I can use the alt-number-pad method or key reassignment to fix this
   problem.  What can I do under Linux?

If relevent, this is my configuration: 486-33, 16MB, 40MB IDE HD partition
for Linux 0.12, SAMSUNG SM2400A modem, generic 101 keyboard.

Your help is much appreciated.

Subject: MicroEMACS 3.11a for Linux
Date: 8 Feb 92 18:52:33 GMT

I've ported MicroEMACS 3.11a to linux, with only a very small number of
changes to the source. This version offers better help and screen
handling than em or uemacs as distributed with Linux in utils.tar.Z, as
well as correct signal handling (e.g. ^C inserts a space, not kills the
program). Ted Ts'o has made the port available from tsx-11.mit.edu for
anonymous ftp.

The file uemacs-linux.tar.Z in pub/linux/usr.bin contains the binary of
MicroEMACS 3.11a Linux, and cdiffs of the relevant files, as compared
to the 3.11a release. Source code and documentation for 3.11 are
available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in the directory
PD1:<MSDOS.UEMACS> and simtel's mirror sites.

I'm not sure if simtel has the 3.11a version or not, so I'm uploading
diffs from 3.11 to 3.11a as provided by MicroEMACS author Daniel
Laurence to comp.emacs in the file uemacs-dif311a.zip in the directory
pub/linux/patches. For some reason these are reverse normal diffs, so
you have to patch by hand, it wasn't me who made them.

If you need these too, apply my patches second. Happy Linuxing!

The 640K memory limit was a HARDWARE limit.  The 64M per process is an
arbitrary SOFTWARE limit imposed by the current design of the mm code.  
There is a WORLD of difference between the PC limit and our limit.

(If this is a problem for you, without redesiging MM you can trade of 
tasks for memory size per task - otherwise a MM redesign will correct this
any time larger address spaces are desired)

The current design of the mm code divides the 4 GB virtual address space
up into 64 64MB parcels - each used by a single task.  This allows the 
use of one set of page tables per system, instead of per task, and keeps
things relatively simple.

Soon, the mm code will have to change drastically, so we
CAN have multiple page tables.  Reasons we want this change are so that

1.  virtual mode tasks require that the 1MB + 64K real mode address
        space appears at absolute address 0 in the task's virtual
        memory space.

2.  We need more space in memory to implement file systems by mapping
        them into memory, instead of using the classic buffering technique.
        By implementing the buffering in this way, it is much easier to
        fuzz the boundary between user memory and buffer cache - allowing
        buffer / user space memory distribution to shift dynamically as needed.
        This increases performance of memory intensive jobs, as they get more
        real memory before swapping.  This increases the performance of 
        disk intensive jobs (such as on a network server), because the amount
        of buffered data will increase, reducing disk access.  

        This also keeps the kernel code smaller - disk buffering / 
        virtual memory code are essentially one and the same.

Subject: Linux on 486
Date: 5 Feb 92 15:59:00 GMT

Two questions:

1) The release notes for 0.12 refer to the installation guide for
   0.11. I can't get hold of this from nic.funet.fi using the
   mailserver, and I can't use anonymous FTP. Can someone please
   send me the 0.11 installation guide?

2) (This might be a consequence of 1!) I have made the root and
   boot disks for Linux, and can boot successfully. It asks for
   the root disk, which I give it. I then get the prompt, for
   which (out of curiosity) I type 'ls'. It works!
   I then type 'ls bin' - it works too
   I then type 'ls dev' - it works too. This is getting good
   I then type 'ls -l dev' and the system hangs.

   This is one step further than 0.11 which just hang after
   typing the first command.

   Anybody seen anything similar, or got any clues?
   My machine 486SX, 64k cache, 4Mb (8Mb sometimes), 130Mb IDE
   split into 4 partions using Minix fdisk. Booting from
   A: Drive - 3.5 1.44Mb.

As an extra to the great fdisk debate: I have seen the problems
that can be generated by the ordering of the partition table
using the start sector number rather than the position in the
partition table. DOS in particular seems to add to the confusion
by putting it's primary partition in the 4th entry.

To prevent confusion (mainly to myself) I rewrote the entire
partition table (using Minix fdisk when running Minix) to
have it's entries in ascending-start-sector order. This
stops giving you lots of '#' warnings in fdisk too!

Cheers,  Mike

Subject: DOS FDISK chokes on drive 2!!!
Date: 9 Feb 92 00:38:47 GMT

I have an interesting problem that maybe someone can help me with.

I recently installed a Maxtor 120MB IDE drive as a slave to my Seagate100MB.
When I first got it I hooked it up exclusively, ran fdisk, and formatted the
drive.  When I hooked it up as a slave, everything worked fine and DOS liked
my new drive D:.  The problems started when I went to repartition for Linux.
 
I ran edpart (which though my drive had 152 heads!), then I ran part (from
the pdisk archive), but it didn't want to save the changes.  Now FDISK just
spins for 10 minutes and comes back with something like "Not enough room
for a DOS partition", but the drive is empty, and I wrote zeros to it
with Norton Utilities.
 
Oh, I did get Linux to properly identify a partition that I made by hand
with Norton DISKEDIT.  I did a mkfs and mounted /dev/hd9.  The next
time I booted up, I only had /dev/dh0 through /dev/dh7 on the floppy.  
What is going on here?!?!?
 
As long as I can get FDISK to respond, I think I will be okay (that is after
I rewrite the root image to the floppy to find dev/hd9).
 
Any help, or references to something in the FAQ or install docs (which I
have read numerous times) that I may have overlooked would be greatly
appreciated.

First of all, it's very easy to get file lentgths > 14 char.  Just
by way of example, consider ``linux-0.12.tar.Z''  I think that's the 
most reasonable name for the compressed tar file of release 0.12 of
linux.  No?

Most shells have a completion feature (TAB in tcsh) that complete
as much of the file name as possible.  So, e.g., if there's only
one linux file in the current directory, you can type ls -l linux[TAB]
and the shell will do the rest.

A week ago I reported a file system problem, and then backed off,
because I found that I was doing something wrong.  Well, I'm seeing it
again.  As in the past, it seems to happen when I do something that
creates files, e.g. a large makefile, and on another screen do
something that accesses files.  This time my file system was trashed
badly enough that I had to rebuild it from backups.  Blocks were
allocated to two different files.  MANY blocks.   This suggests
a race condition in fs.

The screen blanker part of the virtual consoles acts up on occasion.  Instead
of blanking the screen it makes part of the screen white with weird characters.
This is not all the time.  It may be that it only happens when the screen
happens to be updating when the blanker starts.  (ie. when I am copying
alot of files with no keyboard interaction but the screen is updating.)
I cannot tell for sure.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Fixed it perhaps?

The two following programs are useful to save files to floppy.
They are especially useful when tryng to backup a BIG hd to floppy
since they work with stdin/stdout.

What they do is to split the incoming data into 1.3Mb chucks and save
it into floppy with some informations used to retrieve the data.

Possibly this has already being done.....

What follows is :
tar -cf filename .
compress filename
uuencode filename filename >temporary

So take the reversed steps to obtain the source code.
