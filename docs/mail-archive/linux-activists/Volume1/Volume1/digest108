Is this necessary ? Having less directories makes it easier to spot new
files. A script should be sufficient to create an LDS tree.

I think the root FS disk will become an emergency toolbox as soon as a
more complete release (e.g. ABC) with installation tools will be out, so
why shouldn't it be kept compact ?

You're right, of course, but I hadn't thought of that.  :)  One of my
next projects is to develop a 'mktree' script that will install the
LDS standard directory tree on a file system.  Suggestions are
welcomed...

The idea is that the root floppy should be a 'more complete release'!
The ABC release, as I understand, is more of a way of organizing and
distributing the more complete tools.  Basically, it's like this:

Linux 0.95a:    Boot disk by Linus, root disk by me.  This will contain
                the most fundamental Linux utilities necessary to make
                a filesystem and be able to use it as root.  This would
                include /bin, a simple /etc, /dev, possibly /lib, and a
                very few things from /usr/bin.  Installation scripts
                and installation documentation would be here too.

ABC-Release:    A collection of tar files (?) that 'fill the holes' to
                make a complete Linux filesystem.  This would include
                most of /usr/bin, the sources for most of these
                utilities, and in general, the things that are not
                absolutely vital to installing/recovering Linux.

If people think differently (especially the people behind the
ABC-Release!), I'd like to say this makes more sense than having
'competing' releases.  We'll leave that to the BSD/386 and 386BSD
crowd.  :)  (I realize this a gross overgeneralization of the
situation with BSDI and the Jolitz release.  It's just an example.)

The root floppy should still be kept reasonably compact, but the idea
is to still provide maximum functionality in minimum space....

Yes, you can rawrite files from DOS to disk, and then read them with 
tar.  However, this gets _very_ tedious, especially if one doesn't 
have multiple scratch floppies sitting around.  Also, I tried explaining
how this process works to a friend of mine, and gave up after the 
fifth "what? huh?".

My point is that yes, in a perfect world UNIX would have no programs
whose sole function is compatibility with DOS.  However, most(all)
of the people I know who are running Linux have used a DOS system
to download the necessary disk images and files.  For the root and 
boot this isn't a problem, but the other files I got were stored
on DOS-format disks until I rawrited/tar'd enough of them over to
Linux to get mtools compiled.  I don't know about you, but I think
most people don't happen to have access to another UNIX system with
net connections, and most new users don't have a previous installation
of Linux to help with the bootstrap.  DOS systems seem to be prevalent,
and I think it would make sense to have something available (maybe 
a "bootstrap" disk image?) with some mtools binaries on it to help
get those files from dos disks.  After Linux is up, these binaries
could be rm'd and never used again(if that satisfies your UNIX
sensibilities :-) :-)).

Or maybe if we end up having Linux distributed on a set of UNIX-mountable

How is this less tedious than having to copy files to a spare DOS
floppy, and then using the 'bare-bones' mtools that you proposed to
read them?  That just adds another, unnecessary step...  All one
really needs to do is this:

-       get the tar.Z or tar file.
-       rawrite the file to floppy
-       'tar zxvf /dev/floppy0'

>My point is that yes, in a perfect world UNIX would have no programs

In a perfect world, DOS wouldn't exist.  :)

That was the mistake.  The 'other' files (gcc at least, I presume)
should have been rawritten to floppies in the first place.  How is
that any more difficult than copying them to a DOS-format disk?

>could be rm'd and never used again(if that satisfies your UNIX
>sensibilities :-) :-)).

Not really, what happens if they nuke the root partition?  I've come
close to doing that several times.  (And I won't mention how many
times I've wiped out whole directories by accident. :)

>>however, be great if someone took the time to make a mtools.tar.Z that

>

I'm all for it.  I don't use mtools, though, so it's not something I'm
really worried about.

>>Then again, if someone writes a DOS file system for Linux, this
>>discussion would be pointless.

That would be nice, but that could also be worked around by doing
something that the GNU Hurd is doing - make tar a filesystem.  That
way mounting a rawritten tarred floppy is the same as mounting any
other partition (providing it is not compressed, unless the filesystem
did that as well).

>Good luck getting things sorted out for 0.95a.

Thanks, things are falling into place nicely with all the suggestions
I've gotten.  I'm sure it won't thrill everyone, but it should provide
a good base to work from in finding a suitable way to distribute Linux
v1.0 and beyond.

Subject changing is good...  It keeps the subject more informative.
As for quotes, well, they're just there to jog the other person's
memory...  I do a good deal of quote-slashing myself.

A few extra notes on rawrite+tar vs mcopy.

The only program of the mtools you actually _need_ is mcopy.

Using rawrite+tar requires formating the diskette between times. It
also requires every file being <= 1.44M.

The way I use mcopy is to copy files from my DOS-partition onto my
Linux-part.  That way you don't need any extra diskettes, no worrying
about File Sizes.

If it comes to tar _or_ mcopy, tar is of course the choice.

BUT mcopy (and mdir) is my _main_ tool for communicating with the outside
world. I think the same goes for several others.

Johan

They should be.  0.12 simply used the bits as an EGA attribute byte.
This resulted in a non-standard color scheme.  0.95 uses a mapping
table.  The codes now have the same values as in kermit and the ANSI
escape sequences in other OS's I've used.  Since the new values are
consistent with the rest of the world, I wouldn't think Linus would
have any reason to change them again...

This should be, or is on the FAQ.  The stock binary distribution is for US 
keyboards, the stock source distribution for finnish.  Go into keyboard.S,
and change the KBD_ whatever to KBD_US, so you get a "normal" keyboard.

Are you sure about this?  I was under the impression that mcopy was
merely a front-end for mread and mwrite.  If that's the case, you've
got 130k of binaries right there.  Leave out mwrite, and you've still
got about 70k.

Does it?  I've been successful tarring directly to the same floppy
many times, and that's basically the same operation...

Note that the 1.44 limit also applies to writing a file to a DOS
floppy and using mcopy to get it from there.

How do you distribute a pre-compiled mtools that can handle all the
different partitions people have?

We're definitely agreed there.

I understand that, although I do tend to lose sight of it sometimes.
It's easy to start thinking everyone uses kermit under Linux to get
all their stuff to the computer....
