I've also had some difficulties with signals. I got make 3.62 to
compile, but only by changing some references to SIGCLD to SIGCHLD in
job.c and main.c. Unfortunately, make then crashes when a spawned
process dies, with the following:

General Protection:     0000
EIP:    000f:0000012b
Eflags: 00010207
ESP:    0017:03BFF00C
fs:     0010
Base and limit change value

segmentation fault

Is this related? The SIGCHLD is being set to SIG_DFL, not sig_ign. While
I've got your attention, what is it with the make distributed with
linux, that I cant use it when I'm logged in other than root? It always
aborts with (null): setgid: Not owner. Stop. The newer make works,
before crashing.

Iain, I've got a Hayes Smartmodem 1200 hooked up to /dev/tty65, and log
in daily from work. My inittab entry is

tty65:console:/bin/agetty -m -t 30 1200 tty65

but it works without the -t OK too. The real problem I suspect you're
having is initializing the modem properly. Before setting up logins, you
have to disable echo and enable auto-answer on the modem. I do this here
by firing up kermit at 1200, connecting, then sending 'ate0s0=5'
followed by enter to the modem. I suspect I could do this in the /etc/rc
also, perhaps by:

stty 1200 </dev/tty65
echo 'ate0s0=5\n' > /dev/tty65

but I think I tried this once and it didn't work (perhaps I need to set
parity and stop bits too?).

Subject: Problems booting off login kernel
Date: 22 Feb 92 18:42:34 GMT


    Yesterday, I tried making the "login" kernel for Linux.  The compile
went ok, and I dd'ed the Image to a new boot floppy.  I hit my RESET
button and tried to boot the new system. Here's where the problem hit..
    Things started up ok, I got the "Loading......" prompt, but before it
finished the "usual" amount of dots, I got a whole bunch of

    @X: 0400
    AX: 020D
    E600
    CX: 0401
    DX: 0000.

Where the "." after the DX: line seems (I assume) to be from the "Loading.."
string.  I can still boot off of the floppy I made from the distribution 
bootimage, but not this new one.  My guess is that I was using the wrong
bs= parameter for the dd, but I tried several values (8128, 4096, & then
not using a bs=) and none seemd to work.
    Anyone have any ideas?

Hiya. Thanks everyone for the info on Linux.  It boots fine form a floppy,
but I can't seem to get the system image on to the linux partition.
The instructions tell me to modify byte 508 which should be 0, but it is not.
As predictable, it is F6F6.  How do I get the boot image from the boot
floppy on to the minix hard disk partition?
Ack,  thanks.

I suggest you look up D. J. Delorie's GCC port to DOS (of all things). 
I haven't looked at it much personally, and I haven't got it anymore
myself, but it uses a neat technique with demand paging in graphics
pages using the 386 paging system.  It also has support code for many
major cards (Trident, Tseng, Everex, ...) as assembler (MASM, granted,
but it's better than nothing, and it's a lot less messy than including
the BIOS in the correct place for it to work).  I think it's on
grape.ecs.clarkson.edu.
A word of warning however - when I had DJ's GCC, the Trident driver had
a bug when working with mono monitors.  If I get a look at the driver
again, I can tell you what the fix is.  (However, there's been a release
since the last one I had, so it's possible it got fixed anyway.)

Well, I patched together what I got, but mtools is now not on the
rootimage, which is news to me, and lots of files (particularly in
/usr/bin) get duplicated 2 or 3 times.  It would be nice if for 0.13 we
could have a definitive release (with recompiled software) which we
could then patch as necessary.

I installed TeX3.14 as it is available from byron.washington.edu.  As
I recall, things were relatively straightforward.  I believe that the
system V flags worked OK.  Weave and tangle compiled fine, but I had
to make a few hacks to the web2c converter.  Aside from them, things
were pretty uneventful.  Unfortunately I don't really remember what I
had to do, but if you get desperate perhaps I can go back and try to
reconstruct the changed (this may be a bit tricky--I'm a little short
on disk space now).

Ok, I hate Kermit too, so I downloaded rzsz.tar.Z from wuarchive (i think)
and played with it for a while. Well, I got rz to work, and this was 
all I was really interested in. See, the thing is that rz and sz expect
to have (the equivalent of) /dev/tty6[45] as their controlling tty. Which,
if you're connected through Kermit, is not the case. 

Well, anyway, I changed the line that's almost all the way to the end
of the distributed rbsb.c that says 

        Tty=open ("/dev/tty",2);

to /dev/tty65 and then did a gcc -DSV -o rz rz.c (because make barfed
all over the distributed makefile, I've no idea why, and didn't have
time to mess with it.)

So now what I do is dial in with Kermit, call the sz from the other side, 
switch to another virtcons, and call rz. There's no status checking,
or anything else nice like that, but hey, we're hackers, right?

Sz doesn't work as nicely. I'll look at it when I have time. I expect 
that it's a matter of figuring out the -Defines.

Hi,

Good news. Gcc 2.0 is officially released today. I am porting it to
Linux.

I volunteer to be the coordinator for libc.a. I hope when gcc 2.0 is
released for Linux there will be a new, better and more completed
libc.a.

If you have any suggestions or contributions to libc.a, please drop me
a note.

Since gcc 2.0 has C++ support, a wrapper will be added to every header
file, like

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

......
body of the header file
......

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif


I hope gcc 2.0 will be out along with the 0.13 kernel. It will have
features like,

(1) C++, objective C.
(2) iostream
(3) libg++ (I hope)
(4) shared libraries (?).
(5) better libc.a.

BTW, I am looking for a few alpha testers for gcc 2.0. I prefer
someone who knows at least a little bit C++/objective C. I want to test
it thoroughly and use it to do some real jobs. I may start the alpha
test with a few days.

Cheers.

I've gotten sz and rz to work fine under Linux: version 3.02 6-04-89,
by Chuck Forsberg.  The system that worked for the make was sysvr3.

I use some of the tools that came with the Minix zmodem distribution,
namely bgzmod.  ("background zmodem").  Since Linux has job control, I
don't even have to change screens.  I type "rz" or "sz" on the remote
system, get back to the kermit prompt, do *not* exit kermit, but
suspend it with ^Z.  Then just type "bgz sz <files>" or "bgz rz".
When it's done, I "fg" to kermit, type "connect", and I'm back.

Here's the relevant bgz... files:
