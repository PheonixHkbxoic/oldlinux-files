Ramesh,
  i ported the dvips at tsx-11.mit.edu. what produced the dvi file that
u ran dvips on to get the squished output. my guess is troff since it doesnt
use the internal resolution that TeX uses and i've had similar problems
previewing troff generated dvi files.

Not to bother anyone by following up on my own posting, but in regard to my
problems with a 2-drive configuration:

  0.12 works (though the drive activity light stayed on solidly until I did an
       mkfs for a partition on the 2nd drive)
  0.95a does not
  0.95a plus alpha patches does not

I'm curious about the current state of affairs for the next release - is a
definitive solution at hand or in sight?  I'd like to test it if so.  If not,
I'll try to pursue it.

Hello Linuxers,
        In attempting to rebuild the 0.95a kernel (trying to eliminate
the hd interrupts and preparing to add lp), everthing goes well until
the attempt to create console.o where it comes up short with the msg.

What I am doing wrong? Or where should I start looking? I have to do this

Which tar should we be using?  The one that's in the 0.95a root-image seems
to be the same as the one in the 0.12 root-image...I tried out the one that
came in the utils.tar.Z file that Linus put out with 0.12 and it has worked
flawlessly (so far :)...anyway I have been able to untar gcc2.1 with no problem
so I am happy...for now............

Subject: Section 2 of the manpages
Date: 29 Mar 92 01:47:20 GMT

I wrote most of section 2 for Linux.  Missing are 

ioctl
fcntl
select
ptrace

And unofficially 
mmap and munmap.

- sort of got burned out after spending too long with vi, nroff,
and the man macro package.  

Anyways, these are written from the kernel sources, and what ACTUALLY 
goes on, not what SHOULD go on.  Note that you can grab mostly workable
section 3 and 1 pages from any Unix.

I have uploaded them in the file man2.shar.Z under the appropriate incoming
directories of tsx-11 and nic.funet.fi.  There are probably a few 
inaccuracies - if any one else cares to fix these, that would be 
appreciated.  


Formatting : 

These are nroff man package source.  Take your pick of 
cawf, or groff, or format them on something that has the real 
thing if you must have cat pages.

Where it goes : 
/usr/man/man2, and there should be a whatis file there.

cd /usr/man/ 
mv whatis whatis-
cat whatis- man2/whatis | sort > whatis

will make a new whatis incorporating the new functions.


I have a tar at home of formatted and unformatted stuff, a readme,
etc that didn't make my floppy disk - I'll upload that + corrections
if any one has any within a few days...

You might want to try 'procmail'. I compiled it without any problem.
Procmail is able to deliver the mail with the proper permission  (ie
mailbox is only rw to the particular user). I think I have to setuid
procmail. Should I upload 'procmail' ? (You can compile it it one shot. )

My 'lmail' is just :

#!/bin/sh
# use 'formail' if you want to reformat the mail
# formail | procmail -d "$1"
# 
# not using formail
procmail -d "$1"

Unfortunately I don't know how to bounce mail if the local user doesn't
exist. Anyone ?

I understand, and agree with you, but I think that the standards folks should
just choose a standard, and then people can do the "ln -s" dance to make
them whatever they want to.  What the standards for the name are, in my
opinion, irrelevent, since one can always link them to something else.
You wouldn't want to actually RENAME them, of course, because someone
will most certainly write software to conform to the standard that you
just changed (and broke their software in the process).  For example,
/dev/tty should remain /dev/tty, but if someone doesn't like it, they can
always "ln -s /dev/tty /dev/mytty" or some such.

If you use vi (=elvis), you can edit line-drawing characters into
texts in the following way:
  1. add to the termcap entry for your console this line:
        :ti=\E(0:te=\E(B:as=^N:ae=^O:\
  2. make a .exrc file in your home directory with the line:
        set charattr
     (or in vi command mode, say ":set charattr")
  3. in the text, surround characters with \fI ... \fR for the
     special characters; e.g.:
        Special: \fIa0jklmntuvwx\fR (for boxes)

(This works for v. 95a -- I don't know when support for graphics
characters got into the kernel.)

I booted Linux from floppy, and did fdisk.  It showed what I expected,
and a little more.  I saw the partitions I knew about, but I also got
the following:

  /dev/hda2 49861 blocks extended partition (don't use)
     /dev/hda5  8797 blocks active 12-bit DOS
     /dev/hda6 41055 blocks extended partition (don't use)
        /dev/hda9 1262878606 blocks active? (89) unknown partition type 0x86
        (/dev/had10,11,12 with similar entries.)


/dev/hda2 is the extended partition, while /dev/hda5 & 6 are logical
drives in that partition.  I think.  (They're about the right size.)
The problem is, /dev/hda5 shouldn't be formatted with anything.  Why
does it say 12-bit DOS?

What about /dev/hda9,10,11,12?  Believe me, If I had that kind of disk
space, I'd be renting it out!

Could someone send me information on how to get the extended partition
code working?  I want to use /dev/hda5 as a swap partition.

The install to my hard disk worked fine.  Thanks for the scripts!  I,
for one, would never have tried this without something like that.  I
know very little about Unix.

Thanks.
