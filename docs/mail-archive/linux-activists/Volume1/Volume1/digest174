Hello,

I am having problem with compiling program for gdb to debug. I used '-g'
option with gcc, and it complained about not being able to find "libg.a".

So the questions is this:

- Do I need to use '-g' (or -ggdb) options on compliling?
_ If I do, where can I get libg.a (I checked ls-lR on tsx11 site, and
  cannot  find it)?


Thanks in advance.

Dahai.

Hi all.

I'm trying to compile groff, but everytime an echo command appears in
the Makefile, I get "echo: not found" and everything comes to a
screeching halt. echo works fine everywhere else --- even in most
other Makefiles. I'm completely stumped... Any help appreciated.

Subject: tcsh under linux
Date: 30 Mar 92 17:49:27 GMT

This weekend I compiled tcsh 6.00.02 under linux, and it would run the
builtins correctly.  However, when it fork'd and exec'd another program, tcsh
would hang waiting for the child to die (using waitpid).  It *seems* as if the
child would die (and the zombie vanish--but I don't have ps up, so I can't
tell, exactly) before tcsh started waiting for it.

Has anyone had a similar problem with linux (or with tcsh on another machine)?

Does anyone have a working version of tcsh for linux?

PLEASE: NO MY-SHELL-IS-BETTER-THAN-YOUR-SHELL WARS!  Look upon this as a lesson
in porting some generic piece of software to linux, not as a statement about
shell preferences.  Thanks.  [BTW, I did get bash to compile and run fine, but
I'd still like to figure out what was happening with tcsh.]

I have had trouble compiling drivers with SCO's cc compiler.  I did
not tried using rcc;  I have been compiling with Interactive's cc
and transfering the object file to SCO.  Since this seems to work,
I havent really looked into it much more than that.  Please summarize

Sounds good, provided that panic() dumps out the ring buffer in some 
appropriate way.  Also this would make it easier to implement a 
syslogd, etc - where the syslogd could go and dump out the buffer to an
appropriate non-active virtual console.

I posted about this before, but I'm still having problems:

I have  installed GCC 1.4 (gccnew) and make (don't remember where it
came from).  They're both in usr/bin although I've tried them in
usr/local/bin also.  When I try to execute either one, I get:

gcc: Error, unable to execute binary file:  Can't execute program.

Or words to that effect.  This is regardless of whether I'm root or just
a user - regardless of where the files are - or what directory I'm in
(and yes, I have full access rights to gcc).  I know the actual gcc
program is running because if I don't give any arguments (like a file to
compile or whatever) it says "Must specify a file name".  

The only thing that I can think of is that gcc is trying to execute
another program and is having problems - hence the "can't execute
program" or whatever (since I know that gcc is executing).  I have
gas/gar/gld and as/ar/ld in their proper places (whatever it said in the
gcc install thing).  Are there any other little utilities that I might
need to run it??

It may be something really trivial, given my fragmented knowledge of
Unix.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated..

Hi,

I have problem using my  2nd hard drive (Disk 1) for Linux root.

The problem simply stated is this:
        Linux 0.95a  fails to recognize the 2nd hard
        drive on my system.

On boot up, I saw the following message:
        8 Virtual Channels
        4 pty's
        harddisk I/O Error
        Unable to read partition table of device 0340
        Partition tables OK
        Insert root floopy and press ENTER

When I called fdisk, it only displayed partitions on Disk 0, plus a message
saying "Unable to open /dev/hda10".


My system configuration is:
        CPU: Intel 486
        RAM: 8 Meg
        Hard Disks:  Maxtor 213 Meg as the first disk, and Western Digital
                     80 Meg as the second one.
                     The first disk is used for DOS, and has C-I, 7
                     partitions;
                     The second disk is to be used for Linux, with 4
                     partitions, all as extented using edpart.
                     They are both IDE hard disks.

Can some one out there help me to overcome this problem, please?


Thanks.

the dvips package at tsx-11.mit.edu
   (/pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/tex/dvips.tar.Z)
has a correct dvips binary.  the package is Peter Williams port of dvips + misc

print the included dvips.dvi documentation. also added the raw ps tfms needed s
o
that, together with the tfms in textfm.tar.Z, one has everything one needs to
use the standard postscript files with dvips.
   BTW, if ur using TeX, check out the auc-tex package for Emacs. It provides
a very nice TeX interface for Emacs. (i can launch TeX and the step thru errors
even with the old Emacs that seems to have trouble with shelling). the files
are in texfile1.tar.Z

The terminal server at my school allows you to have several sessions open
