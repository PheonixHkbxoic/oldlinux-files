As linux seems to limit file names to 14 characters why are files with names
longer than 14 chars being posted? Have I missed some patch that allows more
than 14 characters in a file name?

Don't want to blow too much bandwidth with this problem because I am probably
looking over something stupid.  I have been running Linux for ~3 months and
never ran across the probelm until I upgraded from .95 to .95 using the
/INSTALL/install shell script from the .95a root floppy.
issueing the following command:

        mount /dev/hda3 /working {from rc file same as .12 and .95 rc file

results in :   mount: unable to open lock-file

what am I missing here?

        Hope this is something I am doing wrong, and not a new bug...:)

I need to include a section in the '(DOS) Beginner's Guide to Linux'
that shows a graphic listing of the 'usual', 'normal', (whatever
that means) of the directory/file structure within the 'basic'
Linux setup. A few of you posting a 'ls -r' (ls -lFR)(?) file
to me in mail, should suffice. I will edit out the subdirectories/files
that are extraenous (personal choice editors, development, etc....).
Thanks in advance...
(Remember, if you post 'once' responses to these 'Beginners' questions,
it will 'responsibly' get included into the 'Guide', so hopefully, these
questions will not be messing up the net over and over again...).

Date: 20 Mar 92 03:59:22 GMT

0.95a runs perfect. Some info :
- the install scripts didn't change my /etc/rc
  I had some commands that were moved to different directory after
  installation. I was expecting the 'install' command would put the new
  /etc/rc in there, but it didn't. I had to copy the new /etc/rc manually

- I tried 'setterm' to change the foreground color to 'green'. It works fine
  until I invoke my editor (vi or joe), the foreground is back to white.
  Any trick to make it stay green ?

I created a 'normal' userid and found several problems with it:
- I can not use kermit to access /dev/ttys1
  When I am root I can use kermit with no problem (I am typing this letter
  with kermit connected to my Univ machine).
  Any solution ?

- I can not compile program(s) with 'make' with this userid. It gives
  this error msg :

  (null): setuid: Not owner. Stop.

  Compiling by hand (ge:  gcc -o test test.c   works fine). I checked
  the 'make' program. It's not setuid.... hm....
  BTW, I forgot where I got the 'make' program, probably tsx-11.mit.edu.

  Anybody had this kind of problem ? or does everybody use 'root' all
  the time ? :-)

- I'd like to get gcc 2.0 up and running. Which file(s) should I get ?
  (I don't want to mess up my configuration now. Last time I downloaded
  gcc I got the wrong libraries... took me a while to figure it out)

- Where can I get the include files for "curses" the library that I got
  seems to be the lib only.

Please post responses since this may be usefull for others ...

Thanks

Hello Linuxers,
        I have changed over to .95a from .12 and like the improvements but
a few changes have me confused. In ver.12 I set a prompt with:
                           PS1='[\u] \w>'
                           PS2='[\u] \w|'
                           export PS1 PS2
in rc in /etc and also in .profile which was in two dirs in ver .12. This does
not work in .95a and I can't find a .profile (naturally I wrote one and it had
no effect. What am I missing?

Also: has anyone had any problems with uemacs-linux in .95a? It worked fine in
.12 but refuses to save a file now.

And: I have never used the Gnu compiler (Linux is my first experience with 
unix) .....where are the docs located? I tried to find a site that had the
docs by themselves, to no avail...I can't ftp a 3meg file to my school account.

I'm crazy about Linux and can't wait to put it on my big scsi drive and use my
little mfm drive for dos....boot from a floppy!!

They aren't designed to change your /etc/rc.  What they should do,
however, is warn you that you may need to change some things.  I did
this because with the utilities on the root disk, there's no neat way
to modify the /etc/rc, and if you're like me, your /etc/rc has been
customized to a fair degree (to mount partitions, set up the hostname,
etc.)

You need to use setterm -foreground green -store.

Make sure that /dev/ttys1 gives read/write permissions to 'other'
users.  As root, do a: chmod a+rw /dev/ttys*.

This is a known problem with the make from tsx-11.mit.edu, and nobody
seems to have worried about it enough to compile the GNU Make or
anything like that.  You can use the pmake from tsx-11 as a stop-gap
measure, but it would be nice if someone would just go ahead and port
the GNU Make.

I use root all the time, but I'm trying to get away from it.  I keep
running into all the file permissions that aren't set very nice,
though.  :)

You need 2misc.tar.Z and 2lib.tar.Z, and the header files from the
latest kernel release, I believe.  Send mail to hlu@eecs.wsu.edu for
the most definitive answer, and for information on how to obtain the
latest release of gcc 2.0 for Linux.  (It's still in alpha-testing, so
I don't want to post it to alt.os.linux.)

As long as you've brought it up, what are your thoughts on the
'install' script?  Good, bad?

I suspect you have a file called '/etc/mtab~', probably from editing
your mtab file with emacs at one time :).  You need to delete this
file before you can mount another partition.  (This is new to the
mount in 0.95, I think, and is used in creating the new mtab file
safely.)

Speaking of mount, etc:  I'll try and combine the sources to all the
misc. Linux-specific utilities like mount/umount/fsck/fdisk, etc, and
upload them to tsx-11.mit.edu sometime soon.  If I get really
ambitious, I'll write a man page or two, also.

Not a new bug, a new feature.  :)

The new root image (rootimage-0.95a.Z) at nic.funet.fi seems
to be corrupt.  For one thing, it is 638190 bytes, while the
file at tsx-11 is 638447 bytes; for another thing, it won't
uncompress on the two systems I have tried to uncompress it.
Please correct this.

Someone, I forget who, was asking for reports of peoples experiences of
running Linux on laptops.

I've successfully run Linux 0.12 on a Toshiba 2200SX, and on a Toshiba
4400SX.  The only problem was loosing the use of the 'resume' facility, which
saves what you were doing when you power the machine off, and restores it
when you power back on.  This seems to need a DOS file system in place, and I
had given the whole disk over to Linux.

Hope this was of some help

Date: Fri, 20 Mar 1992 05:41:44 GMT

Hi:


   As the subject line says, I upgraded to 0.95a kernel but kept everything
else as it was with 0.12. Generally things are ok except for the following.
Whenever I mount or umount any partition mtab becomes empty. Somehow mtab is
always empty. This is quite annoying as I don't know what file systems are
mounted and where. Also df doesn't work (as mtab is empty). Can anyone help?

Setting the prompt in /etc/rc would have no effect, but that has
absolutely nothing to do with your problem.  :)

The problem is that the new /bin/sh on the 0.95a root floppy doesn't
have all the wonderful little goodies you can include in your prompt
like bash (the old /bin/sh) does.  There are ways to work around this,
but they're messy and you're better off using 'bash' as your
interactive shell, anyways.  How do you do this?

1) get out the ol' 0.12 root floppy.
2) mount it (most likely something like 'mount /dev/at0 /mnt')
3) cp /mnt/bin/sh /bin/bash
4) edit your /etc/passwd so the last field is /bin/bash instead of
   /bin/sh.

If you're logged in as non-root, make sure the directory you're saving
to has file permissions set up such that you're allowed to write to it.

There is a manual page with the gcc 2.0 compiler, but it wouldn't be
of much use if you have no experience with unixish c compilers.  The
best thing you could do, I think, is to poke around on your school's
machine for manual pages on 'cc'.  The semantics are essentially the
same.
