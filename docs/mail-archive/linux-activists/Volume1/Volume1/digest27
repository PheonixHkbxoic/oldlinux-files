At least GNU emacs sources seem to #define rindex strrchr for sysV, so
I suppose that's equivalent or at least very similar in function to
rindex.

The one and only crypt to consider is UFS, Ultra Fast Crypt, developed
here by Michael Glad. It was resently posted to alt.sources. It's
distributed under Copyleft. I'm not sure of the legal issues, but
as FSF has adapted it, there should be no problem.

BTW, it not just a gimmick, it real fast.

..Many cooks.. Really, consult the TODO lists available from all the
ftp sites to see who, if any, is working on what. The list is maintained by
Robert Blum (blum@cip-s01.informatik.rwth-aachen.de).

Sigh, that old myth again. No, that's not what the three syncs are
for. Here's the reality. A sync does not return until all the
blocks in the _buffer cache_ are queued for writing. However, most
of those blocks are still in the _disk queues_ after the sync
returns. There is no way in older Unixes to know when they are out
of the disk queues. So, the first sync flushes the buffer cache;
the second and third are there just so that the typist waits a
decent amount of time until all blocks have made it out of the
disk queue before taking the system down.

Well I said that the last release was going to be the last before the
rewrite, but people found enough minor bugs so that I have to make another. 
But good news!  I finally have an anonymous ftp archive site (yeah! no more
stupid uuencoding or people complaining that I posted it wrong):

        ftp             wpi.wpi.edu   (130.215.24.1)

        binary
        get             joe.tar.Z

The fixes for this version:

        Recursive macros detected

        Control characters typed in prompts are properly handled

        stdout/stderr are set right for the 'pipe block through shell

:

: pretty easy to port, right?
: 
:     Apologies if I'm stepping on anyone else's toes with this.  Now, on to
: my problems...
: 
:     Right now, my biggest problem occurs when 'init' starts up.  It starts
: a process for '/dev/tty64' (my modem port).  I start the system up with a
: machine already attached to the modem, and it happily displays a 'login: '
: on it.  Furthermore, after 60 seconds, it happily displays a timed-out
: message, and another 'login: '.

The main problem here is that the kernel shouldn't send a 'login:' to
the modem unless the modem has a carrier detect. This means that you
will need to write the modem control/status ioctl's for linux. Take a
look at the file that does the serial interrupts. It curently seems to
just ignore any chnage in the modem status, inparticular , hangup's :(
(This is something that is a worry to me. If you has a shell running and
have set dev/tty64 to echo characters, and the modem hangs up .....
Both the modem AND the terminal are echo'ing characters back to each
other... Pretty nasty. )

: 
:     The problem is twofold.  1)  All keyboard input from the modem is
: ignored.  Completely.  Nothing seems to get through.  I see data coming
: into the modem, but the login program doesn't respond at all.  Whassup?

Number of things could be happening here, the most probable that you
haven't setup the terminal right. /dev/tty6[45] is by default in raw
mode. This means characters aren't echoed and no translation is done. In
particular, this means that if it is looking for a LF as end of line,
it will NOT use a CR as the end of line. Also, characters AREN'T echoed.

I my modem control prog that I use, it does 
        stty echo opost onlcr icrnl isig icanon 2400 -a /dev/tty64
When it gets a 'CONNECT' message. (Yes, I confess. I was too lazy to
write the modem control bits. Also too ignorant ;)

I am not sure exactly what terminal mode login(1) should use, but it is
likely that you want icanon at least (This buffers the input untill a NL
allowing you to edit the line with  DEL chars).

: 
:     2) Whenever the 'init' program sends data to the modem (specifically,
: the 'login' and 'timeout' message) whether there is a connection on it or
: not, a GPI occurs.  (At least I think thats what it was.  Not there right
: now, so I can't test it.)
: 
:     I'm lost, confused, dazed, baffled, and ignoring it.  *grin*
: 
:     I do have a third problem, unrelated to the previous two.  My drive
: has a large number of 'fsck' errors coming up.  What do I do to fix this?
: (It's annoying, and I think it may be causing some more serious problems.)

do a 'fsck -a /dev/hd[whatnot]'. The -a tells it to fix automatically.
NOTE that the demand loading used by linux can cause some spurious error
messages. Also, (I think fsck does this anyway, but it can't hurt),
remeber to sync before you fsck.

: 
:     In any case, if anyone else is working on init/login/etc., please get in
: touch with me!  I figure you're probably better at it than I, and I'd love
: to get info from you!

I wouldn't mind a look at your code. Will you drop it on a ftp site
somewhere??

First off... Glad to see someone read my post!

        Setting the output unbuffered would work, but better you should do the
        flush yourself since that's the right place to do it.  SunOS (and other
        stdio implementations) do a flush after every printf(), etc. for you if
        the output is directed to a tty.  A kludge for lazy programmers that
        just complicates a stdio implementation -- I'm glad that linux leaves
        it out.

There's a small problem with your arguement (although being the way I am,
I'd argue your point if someone brought it up, just because I tend to argue
all points from all directions). Not having stdio act identically to all
other Unices will break alot of programs. Mine included. Of course, I have
nothing against doing an old "fflush(stdout)" before all input routines,
but breaking programs that rely on the "defacto standard", if not
"moralistically right", is not a "good thing."

You may argue that the implementation of malloc(0) returning NULL breaks
programs, but those programs were written incorrectly. Indeed, mine may
be written incorrectly too. But isn't there a standard saying that stdout
is flushed when stdin is read?

Cheers,

Doug

There are two programs I found mentioned in PC Magazine, July 1991 (v5

"The first is B:Boot! (YWSoft Co., Bloomington, Ind; 812-857-4772;

"The second is a shareware program called Boot-B: (Solutions by the
Numbers, Germantown, Md.; $10).  You can download Boot-B: as
BOOT-B.ZIP from Library6/Advisor of the Utilities/Tips Forum on
Ziff-Net"

The last is accessible via CompuServe, although how accessible I don't
really know (I use CompuServe very infrequently).

The article in PC goes on to discuss the program limitations, so you
might want to look at the article to see if they might be useful to
you.

Subject: TODO List (Is there such a beast?)
Date: 31 Jan 92 03:16:19 GMT

Greetings,
    I've been told that some of what I'm hacking on is being worked on
by others.  (Not that I'm going to stop because of that.  I'm having
too much fun!)  The one message that surprised me, was a reference to
a TODO list.

    I'd very much like to see this 'TODO' list, since the last one I
have suggested that VFS might be implemented in time for 0.11.  (Got
an idea of how far back that was?)

    Anyhow, keep the suggestions coming...  In terms of handling modem
connections, I think I'll use the 'nonlocal' bit of the ttytabs, and
have 'init' do some initial setups and waiting with it.

    At this time I'm going to assume Hayes command set comapatibility
on the modems, since I'm not enough of a guru to know where that sort
of info would normally be kept.

    I've just picked up the bsd-sources utmp.h file, as well as a few
other things, to see if that's a better (or even compatible) way of
doing it.  (Until now, it was basically based around the SunOS 4.1.1
system's man-pages.)

    This brings me to a legal question...  What's the legal status of
grabbing someone else's include file?  (Like SunOS's.)  Bad idea?
I mean, basing things off the man pages produced a remarkably similar
structure, *PRIOR* to seeing the include file...

    Better to stick with BSD's #include files?  (I'm assuming that
those are freely distributable, true/false?)

    I've picked up a bunch of login, etc., programs and will be
figuring out what I'm missing tonight, and hopefully implementing it.

    Further comments, suggestions, flames, etc., are welcome!

I got ufc running with no changes to the source.  It was posted to one of the
source groups last fall.  I also put /usr/dict/words on the system, and it
encrypts every word in in 90 seconds. (!).  This is a 20 mhz 386.  Using the
standard crypt(3) call on an unloaded Sparc1 tasks about 12 minutes.

I got ufc running because I wanted to put passwd(1) in Linux, but it looks like
