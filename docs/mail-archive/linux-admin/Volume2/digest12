    I do the following to write and extract files .....
tar cfv - . | gzip | dd of=/dev/ftape    ** this backs up everything **
dd if=/dev/ftape | tar zxpfv - .   *** to restore everything **
dd if=/dev/ftape | tar zxpfv - filename  *** full pathnanme omitting
                                             the first / . this takes
   ages as it seems to read the whole tape, rewind and then reads
   forwards to extract it.
       I am sure there is a more elegant method .... later .... but
it works fine.

Hei dude!!
We have installed Slackware Linux 1.0.8 on a 486 based PC.
I have notice this _strange_ chmod setting into the directory 
/var/spool/mail

drwxrwxr-x   2 root     mail         1024 Sep  1 16:07 ./
drwxr-xr-x  19 root     root         1024 Jun  6 11:34 ../
-rw-rw----   1 paolo    staff           0 Sep  1 13:47 paolo
-rw-rw----   1 marco    guest           0 Jul 25 16:06 marco
-rw-rw----   1 stefan   guest       10706 Jun 17 15:02 stefan
-rw-rw----   1 pier     guest           0 Aug 31 00:00 pier
    ^^------- ????????????
This means that all the user in the same group can read their mail each 
other and this in in contrast with the privacy rules. I can change the modes 
via chmod every time I add a new user, but is there a way to avoid this 
automagically?? 

Thank you.
Bruno.

Subject: Configure OSPF on gated 3.0.3 (Linux)?
Date: 1 Sep 1994 17:07:53 GMT

I need to figure out how to set up OSPF routing on my Linux (1.1.18)
gateway. I'm using gated 3.0.3, with a current RIP configuration. 
Unfortunately, our new Internet access provider uses OSPF (only),
and I've never used OSPF.

What kinds of information do I need to get from them? I've got a few
sample configurations (from the gated 3.5 Alpha) that have OSPF stuff,
but I don't know if they'll even work (so far they haven't).

I have tried a few things (ospf yes; in the gated.conf), but gated -c
always gives a "parsing error at ospf", so I assume either gated
doesn't support ospf (though it says it does), or I have to give it
some more information.

Also, will I have to have my Internet provider "feed" me OSPF updates
(as I had to do with RIP)?

Actually, the best thing would be to give me a good source on gated
and OSPF configuration. The O'Reilly _TCP/IP_Network_Administration_
is pretty out of date on gated and OSPF, so a more up-to-date source
would be great.

I would appreciate any response on this, and the sooner, the better.
I'm working on this right now, and need help. If possible, email
to pete@dswi.com or kruckenb@sal.cs.utah.edu would be best, and I 
will summarize to this group.

Thanks.
Pete.

For the record there IS a program to let you access HFS 1.44MB floppies from
Linux, in the same way as mtools lets you for DOS floppyies. It's called
xhfs, and is available in the utils/disk-management directory on Sunsite as
xhfs0_3.tgz

It works well enough for my purposes, but I can't wait for something better.

   Calm down guys.  It's no more unsafe than a passwordless account.  Remember,
he never said he was going to log this account into a shell.

   And BTW- him putting this kind of account on the Internet is absolutely no
threat to the security at my site.  And if you're doing your job, it isn't a
threat to your site either, any more than all the newly created student accounts
at schools across the world are.

You could probably get around your difficulty with Symbolic links.
For example:

cd /
mkdir things
cd things
(cd /usr ; tar cf - X386 ) tar xvf -
rm -rf /usr/X386                        << Check that the previous step worked
                                                before doing this !!
cd /usr
ln -s /things/X386 .

This would move the directory /usr/X386 into a directory called /things/X386,
which would occupy space on your oversized root partition, and free space on 
your /usr partition. You could change X386 to any directory of your choice in
/usr.
E-mail me if there are any problems.

Subject: CU sudo version 1.3.1 released
Date: 31 Aug 1994 22:46:55 GMT

Version 1.3.1 of the CU version of sudo has been released.  Sudo is a
program that allows a system administrator to give limited root
access to users and logs copiously.  Version 1.3.1 is based on The Root
Group's sudo 1.1 and is covered under the GNU Copyleft.

The differences between 1.3 and 1.3.1 consist mostly of bug fixes,
minor featur additions, portability changes, and code reorganization.
See the CHANGES file for all the gory details.

Some of the changes include:
    Native solaris support, bsd compatibility libraries are no longer
    necesary for *any* architecture, posix functionality is used if
    present (signals, sysconf(), etc), -V, -v, and -k flags, shadow
    password support for some architectures, a configure script,
    and more.

If you are running an older version of sudo I would highly suggest that
you pick up the latest version.

CU sudo 1.3.1 is known to work on the following platforms:
    AIX 3.x
    4.3 BSD (including MORE/BSD)
    BSDI (BSD/386)
    ConvexOS 9.1 (C2 support untested)
    HP BSD 2.0
    HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (w/ or w/o shadow passwords, see INSTALL)
    Irix 4.x and 5.x
    KSR OS
    Linux (shadow password support untested)
    NextStep 2.x and 3.x
    DEC OSF/1 1.x and 2.0
    SunOS 3.5 and 4.x
    Solaris 2.x
    Ultrix 4.x (w/ or w/o enhanced security, see INSTALL)

CU sudo 1.3.1 is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.colorado.edu
as pub/sysadmin/utilities/cu-sudo.v1.3.1.tar.Z

You may be thinking about UserMaint. These are used in the Yggdrasil

   I'd volunteer for contibutions to such a project _if_ there will be a team.

I've seen recent reports of several different projects. I'm new

Subject: Script: Login Stats
Date: Thu, 1 Sep 1994 14:08:36 GMT

Ok, ok, don't sweat this one too much. I often write scripts just to
learn something. This one was an excersize in gawk again. It process
the /var/adm/wtmp file via the last command. It generates an output 
that could be useful to some. If you check the top of the file you'll
note some parameters you can pass it. If you'll run it in a cron job
once a month with the write option it'll keep running stats available
that can be accessed.

Really, simply, my /var/adm/wtmp was huge and I wanted a way to not lose
all the information in it, but to also be able to delete it once a month.
So I wrote this script. If you have any questions or comments, please let
me know.

Gnu pascal is in testing but seems not bad (its in with the debian release
bits). There is also p2c (pascal to C) which can be combined with gcc to
build pascal stuff. 

As to ADA there is GNATS in development, and I believe some kind of
interpreted ada environment around too.

You've got two choices: either enable the option in the kernel,
or patch your libc.  Either will work.

Sorry if this was less than clear :-)

Upgrade both machines. The TCP code in 1.1.18 knows that tcp frames from
a multicast source are illegal. Alas the older PLIP makes up a fake
multicast not unicast physical address. Thus you need to upgrade both ends.
