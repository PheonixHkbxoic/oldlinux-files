This may be obvioous to some but not all. The easiest way to verify that
your swap is active is with the "free" command. You should also see the
swap get activated in the boot process, once swapon is activated...

It should work very well. You can use the OS/2 boot manager to boot
Linux too if you wish... And Linux can be on any drive (as long as the
boot manager recognises it).

I have Linux in the third and fourth (swap) partitions on my second IDE
drive, and use LILO as a boot loader (it fits in any boot sector, no
need to repartition). It works great. :)

[ Article crossposted from comp.os.linux.help ]
[ Author was Craig Johnston ]
[ Posted on Fri, 9 Sep 1994 14:50:35 GMT ]

Well, I asked this before, and I know someone knows more than I on the
subject, but I was helpfully ignored.  (Note -- I do answer Linuxers
questions when I know something they don't.)  Anyway, this is it:

I have read the ethernet FAQ, or HOWTO or whatever and all of 'em.  The
only EISA NIC I see mentioned is the 3com 3c579 card.  It is noted that
the card is not fully 32 bit.  Can someone advise me as to the best
EISA ethernet solution for Linux?  Stability and low processor overhead
are important.  Speed would be nice too.  So, which one?  I see a 3210
card mentioned in the config file for the kernel.  Comments?   EISA
card worth having?  I know throughput will not be affected, in all
likelihood.  I am looking to avoid bounce buffers and minimize processor
activity.  Should I bother over a fast 16-bit ISA card?  Anything
better than the 3c579?  3200 cards, 3210 cards, the SMC EISA card, what?
Any and all information would be appreciated.  If there exists a 
vastly superior card with no driver but the information is available, I'd
like to hear about that too, and the Linux world may end up with 
another NIC driver.  

Thanks in advance for any and all info,
Craig.

Subject: identd over term
Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 13:25:59 GMT



Hi guys,

I have a small problem with running identd (user authentication software, TAP
 compatible) on my Linux box. My linux box is connected to the internet via 
a modem over which a run a term (1.19) connection.

Running identd via inetd.conf presents me a problem that it only checks the
ports on my site of the connection. As I'm running term all users entering my
machine are logged as 'me' (my login id) and the machine they are calling from
is my Linux box. I want this , of course, to be the name of the actual remote
user and the actual remote machine.

Software: Linux 1.0.9
          term 1.19
          pidentd-2.2beta3


Is there a solution to this??? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I had this same problem until I recompiled using the -DCONNER_BUG and

you may not need the DATA_RATE set.. However, there seems to be
another bug.. the floppy drive is unavailable after using the tape drive.

Agreed. Not only is dx66 internally faster, since it combines MMU, internal
cache, FPU, CPU in one chip at its native package, it should beat dx50 in
most cases.

Yes....believe it or not....but i think this is the reason...you see....some
ne2000 cards are more compatible than others...there are compatible cards...
and then there are compatible cards....

one which i have found to be compat. is the genius (logitech) one....
so far this hasnt failed me on netware or any other package....

so...your card is being found....being addressed as if it were an ne2000....
and then it is getting scrmalbed (?) by something on the board....

Date: 8 Sep 94 05:31:38 GMT

Hi there,

I currently have LILO running as the boot manager. But now I would
like to remove that. I believe once I removed it, there will be no boot
manager, thus my MS-DOS partition won't be reached?

Can someone direct me in nicely removing LILO so that either my MS-DOS
partition will boot up, or my new OS will boot up?

Thanks in advance.

"Unknown possibilities..." I'll have to repeat the question: What IS
the problem?  The only real answer I have got so far is that the
passwd program is buggy.

With only one root password several people need to know thw same
password, which is not a good thing, IMHO.  The difference is more
psychological than technical.  I think a common password has a greater
tendency to start spreading around than a personal superuser password.
Compare the two questions: "What is your superuser password?" and
"What is the server password?"  I'm not saying you should give
superuser privs to anybody you don't trust, but everybody is human and
many of us live in the real world where jobs have to get done.  (Which
is also one of the reasons you often need several people with root
privileges.)  Administering a single common root password is also more
difficult, because you'll have to notify other people that you have
changed it.
