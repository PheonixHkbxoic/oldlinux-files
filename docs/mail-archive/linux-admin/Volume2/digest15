When running ConfigXF86, when your choices for monitor appear, select
'Cheap 14" (TRY THIS FIRST)'.  I have an 8900c card and my original selection
for monitor also gave me just 800x600 and 640x480, but this selection gave
all three resolutions.

To make it pannable, enter a "virtual size" larger than the actual size.

(P.S. I know, I know, it's not "cheap".  Sorry, I didn't label it; that's
what it says. :)

Curious.  I had the same problem.  As a side-effect of switching from
dip to dslip (Matt Dillon's slip package), I discovered that slattach
and dslip both flat out do not work when I specified CSLIP instead of
SLIP.  Yet dip seemed to work--aside from the overruns.

Without looking into any code, my theory is that the remote end of my
dialup isn't really set up for CSLIP.  Dip is still able to establish
a (broken) connection.  Slattach and dslip fail.  

I need to contact the appropriate person in my organization to check
on what my dialup is really configured for...

Date: 2 Sep 1994 19:07:41 +0200

Hello,

I am having problems getting my nec cdr210 cdrom to work wih linux.
The facts:

linux 1.1.45 kernel with cdrom, iso9660 and generic ncr5380 lowlevel scsi
driver compiled. during startup it says: scsi: 0 hosts.
My scsi card is a DTC avidtek 3151 xt board size scsi board with it's base
address set at DC00h (factory default). under msdos 6.2 everything works
fine so no hardware problems. 

I grepped through the source and found references for the ncr53c400 (which
is the scsi chip on the card) in the generic ncr5380 code. I read the
scsi-howto and the cdrom-howto. But whatever I tried, It doesn't work.
every time I get scsi: 0 hosts. 

Question has anyone gotten this dtc card working under linux and how thit
you do it?? 

I read that you can give parameters at the lilo prompt when booting a kernel
to override the autoprobe etc. but What port and irq uses this board. I can
only use the jumpers on it to relocate the 16 kb ram space it needs. Which I
now have set at the factory default of DC00h. I think getting the NEC cdr210
to work won't be a problem when the scsi card is recognised by the kernel.

So if anyone has this board please let me know how you did it.
(is maybe adding the trantor 130b patches usefull)???

I had the same same, or a similar, problem. My config is
        SCSI ahrd disc on AH1542
        Mitsumi CD on a proprietary i/f
I could not find any kernel that would drive both the SCSI and the
Mitsumi.

What I did was to copy the /slackware/ directory tree to a spare hard
disc partition, using MSDOS, and then used the pure SCSI kernel
startup kernel on a floppy to boot and build a new kernel that had
just what I wanted in it. The cdscsi startup kernel would not work
with my CD -- it insisted on having a Sony drive.

Try to dereference it and have a signal handler to catch the
pointer fault. The handler just sets a global variable.

Sounds tailor-made for an S3-801 board.

Works, fixed clocks, IMHO overpriced.

works well (I have the VLB version, a VL-24)
some recent boards appear to have problems with
the on-board frequency synthesizer when you
change modes.  When it works, it's nice not
to worry about what dot-clocks you have available,
since the card can synthesize any with about
0.1 MHz resolution.

*  Actix GraphicsEngine 32
works well, slightly cheaper, fixed clocks

*  No-name Taiwan Clone
I haven't heard any horror stories, and some
people have reported success.

Prices should range from US$99 (Taiwan mail order)
to US$160 (STB local retail)  All these cards should come
with 1M 60ns DRAM, and be useful up to about 70 MHz dot-clock,
sufficient to run 1024x768ni.  Going above 1024x768 is not
normally recommended, both because you run out of DRAM bandwidth,
and you start eating into the 256K used for font caching.
STB says their parts should "work" up to 80 MHz dot clock, and
the freq synthesizer and RAMDAC is limited by XFree to 110 MHz.

All I get is flicker on the screen.

Does anyone have a similar (working) configuration?

Subject: Filters on remote printers [?]
Date: 01 Sep 1994 19:16:41 GMT

Hi, I'm currently using lpr and a printcap file to send print jobs to
a remote printer.  However, I'm trying to add another remote printer
that does no filtering of its own.  I've read the docs, but I can't
see any way to cause each print job to be filtered before going to a
remote printer.  Everything I read says that the "if=" line in
/etc/printcap is ignored for remote printers.

Is there way around this?  Did I miss something?  I've read the
printing-faq also but saw no clues there.  Any ideas would be greatly
appreciated.

BTW, I'm running Slackware 2.0, lpr and using apsfilter 2.0 for filtering.

 Linux do support Exabytes. I have an EXB-8500 (SCSI-2, ID 2, external case)

 Try to give your EXB another (free) ID and be sure that it's terminated

 I'm using /dev/nrmt0 or /dev/nrst0 as device.
