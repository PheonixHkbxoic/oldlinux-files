        This is with the ATI Mach8 server which works perfectly with

Subject: 20 Mb RAM: Linux sees 16Mb
Date: Sat, 10 Sep 1994 03:33:23 GMT

Hello,

I just installed installed an extra 8Mb in addition to
the 12 Mb I already had. That makes twenty.
The power_up RAM count gives 20 Mb....
Running the EISA EASY config util also shows 20 Mb RAM.
Booting dos 5.0 gives me 16 Mb ram, but that is known...
DOS has a limit of 16 Mb RAM (16-bit OS?).
Now when I boot Linux (32-bit OS) I still get 'only' 16 Mb RAM 
instead of 20Mb. YES I have disabled the 16 Mb RAM limit in the kernel:

bool 'Limit memory to low 16MB' CONFIG_MAX_16M n

Usually you would place your devices into fstab and then /sbin/swapon -a

This is true also for swapoff.

I just finished ftp-ing it and it ran fine, but small window! when I tried
-2 -3 -4 the picture still ran, but it was terrible. My Xserver is fine -
well could use more ram - so I figure that running small is about it. Runs
smoothly and quick. I'd hafta say it runs a tad better under linux than dos,

rpc.portmap, rpc.mountd, and rpc.nfsd need to be running on the machine
whose drives you want to NFS mount.  If I follow your explanation, you
need them running on machine B.  Then, from machine A, issue the
mount -t nfs B:/home /mnt 
command.  Also, you need the line:
/home      A(rw)
in B's /etc/exports file.

'perfmeter' is an X program that resembles 'xload'.  If you wish to use
perfmeter, you need to also run 'rpc.rstatd'.

Try the apsfilter by Andreas Klemm   andreas@knobel.knirsch.de

It has a great auto-configuration shell script to install an enhanced
aps-2 filter with automatic file type recognition for ascii, post-script
and dvi.
There is command-line disabling of the "two pages on one" feature.

I use version 2.3 that comes with Slackware 2.0 with an Apple LaserWriter NTR
and find it very useful - even on a postscript printer. Aps-301 is now
available from ftp.Germany.EU.Net:/pub/comp/i386/Linux/Incoming.EUnet/

        Using Crack in this manner is kind of akin to killing ants with
a hammer.  Look for programs like uva.passwd.  It may take a little patching
to work but it should be happy.   I *think* I put my linux-patched version
of patch on ftp.csh.rit.edu:/pub/linux/system/?  But it's not that big of a
switch.  It checks for simple user info and scans for dictionary (and partial
match) passwords.  IT takes a few seconds longer to change a password, but
it's happy. :)

Supposedly you have to specify that you're mounting the CD as read only
with the newer kernels. I say supposedly because I don't have a newer

Most of the newer distributions (Slackware 2.00 and whatever the latest 
SLS is) include the Berkeley mail program (otherwise known as mailx, 
Mail, etc.)  I know for a fact that the latest Slackware (2.0.0) version 
of mailx works as a replacement for /bin/mail -- just make a symbolic 
link:  ln -s /usr/bin/Mail /bin/mail

The problem is (IMHO) that one entry in passwd per UID is a basic assumption
in unix operating systems.  What in your view is a bug is, rather, the fact
that the operating system treats an anomaly differently from the way you
personally would like to have it treated.  Even if the login aspect were
corrected to your satisfaction, the fact remains that after login the OS
remembers that you are UID 0, not root, Sid, or Nancy.  There is no way to
predict absolutely how this will affect later actions in every possible
situation.  Consequently, the confusion others mention does not merely
refer to your password problem but to other unknown possibilities as well.

Other versions of unix may be written slightly differently so as not to
produce the specific problem mentioned, but all that I know of can produce
unexpected results with multiple users with the same UID.  So, my question
is why use a non-standard, uncertain means of granting super-user privs to
several people when a standard system (one root account with su privs given
to those who need it) already exists?

The one disadvantage I see for the single root account is the possibility of
a screw-up in changing the password, so that no one knows what it is.
However, I would humbly suggest that anyone who does not thoroughly know and
believe in the necessity of testing a new root password before logging out of
the root shell, has no business exercising root priveleges.

There are a couple of alternative passwd programs, one called npasswd and the
other passwd+ (there may be more that I dont know about)  which check to
see if the password is a 'safe' one before allowing the user to change it.
