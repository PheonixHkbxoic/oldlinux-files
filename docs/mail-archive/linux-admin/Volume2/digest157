Hi,

i suggest you have also installed the disks on your system.
Then you should be able to find your startx-script in the /usr/bin/X11
directory.
If it is not in this location it could be in /usr/X386/bin or in /usr/X11/bin.
On my linux 1.0.8 (Slackware 2.??) Distribution the last directories are
symbolic links to /usr/bin/X11.

If you've found it you should set your PATH to the estimated directory.

If you can't find your file in one of these directories it is also possible
that you got an corrupt diskset. Maybe the archive has been updated before you
finish your copy.

Tschau

Subject: Xterminals with Linux as X server
Date: 6 Oct 1994 23:08:20 GMT

I need to setup some Xterminals using multiple Linux machines
as possible servers.

The Xterminals are capable of handling the windowing capability.

The Xterminals broadcast an XDMCP when booted.

The Linux machine responds with a (willing to manage) message.

Currently, the Linux machines respond to it
BUT the windows are managed by the
Linux machine. As one can guess, once many Xterminals are served
by a single Linux machine, it is soon overwhelmed.

I am running Xfree 2.1 , Slackware 1.2 with Kernel 1.1.13
The window manager used is fvwm.

How do I get the Linux machine to respond to the XDMCP, but let
the Xterminals manage their windows ?
Is this even possible ?
I have seen it work with a SUN running Openlook / SunOS.

I have tried changing the Xaccess and Xserver files in the
/usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm  directory but cannot figure it out.
The man pages were a little help in initailly setting up 
what I have running but I cannot figure out how to let the
Xterminals manage their own windows.

Please help

Subject: Yggdrasil Fall '94 sendmail->UUCP broken
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 15:25:22 GMT

Has anybody gotten the automatic routing of outgoing internet
mail over the UUCP server at Yggdrasil to work?

This is supposed to be set up and work "out of the box", but it doesn't.

I otherwise have a fully working system, and except for the fact that the
installation instructions in the manual are only loosely correlated with
the actual install script, the installation went smoothly.

I have gotten all the errata sheets and made the fixes, except for
the item which talks about the wrong path for the inet daemon.
I fixed the rc.net file so that my machine name is set correctly from
the /etc/hostname file. I'm not sure if this is what the errata sheets
meant.

I don't know squat about configuring smail and uucp, but as far as I have
tracked it down:

1. The uux process is called every 10 minutes and puts a note in it's
log file /usr/spool/uucp/.Log which says "no work".

2. The sendmail process puts messages that I send to internet addresses
into /usr/spool/smail/msglog with each message having the note "DNS BIND
failure unkown address", or something like that.

3. I don't have a network card.

4. Under the control-panel setup for UUCP, the yggdrasil entry has a
phone number of "32", this can't be correct.

Well, I'm stumped, any help would be appreciated. I've sent a couple
of email messages to yggdrasil, but I haven't gotten any replies.

: If all you're going to do is add another drive, stay IDE.  There really
: isn't any speed difference between them anymore.  You'll hear people
: scream that when they updated to SCSI, things got faster.  But, they're
: probably comparing an older IDE drive with a new VLB SCSI card.  I
: recently added a SCSI drive.  I now have a 500MB IDE drive, and a 1GB
: SCSI-2 drive.  I have a SCSI-2 ISA controller, and enhanced IDE
: controller.  The SCSI drive has a faster spin rate, lower access time,
: higher transfer rate (it's newer), but the IDE drive outperforms the
: SCSI drive by about 150K/sec.

Is that a decent SCSI card?  My ISA SCSI card only gets me about 1800k per
second but thats because I have a cheapo one.  I tried my drive on a good
one and got 5000kps..  (I have DEC 1.6 GB SCSI-2)  that's non F/W.  
Sure Enhanced IDE is quite a bit faster than standard IDE.  But there is 
quite a bit of jury-rigging the card, drive, and softwares have to do to
put that together.  Many problems occur with Enhanced IDE, as IDE actually
has a limit of 512MB size partitions (i believe that is the number)  A couple
of my friends who went Enhanced IDE and now regret it.  They've had problems
with managing their partitions.  (this is on large GB drives).  Everyone
talks about the new Enhanced IDE but no one mentions SCSI-3..  If you really
want to scream....  go SCSI-3.  

: However, if you want to have more than 2 hard drives, or a CD-ROM, go
: SCSI.  Keep in mind, that most SCSI cards have BIOS on them that scan

: It usually takes 5-30 seconds for the card to do this, and you're
: sitting there waiting the whole time.  If you're using DOS, you'll need
: to load several device drivers to ASPI, int 13, CAM, etc support eating
: up conventional memory.

That is just not true.  My SCSI reads my chain in less than 2 seconds.  My
mouse takes longer to initialize.  It is not necessary to run ANY device 
drivers.  They are optional.  As are many Enhanced IDE DOS drivers.  BIOS
is not usually required to be enabled if you are not using DOS as other
OS's many times have drivers specifically written for each card. (as in the
case of Linux)  If you decide for SCSI, I'll recommend not cheaping out on
the host adapter..  makes a big difference even for ISA boards.. If you got
VLB go for it.

: I bought SCSI for the CD-ROM, and disabled the bios on the card.  I
: purchased a SCSI hd because I thought they were faster for multitasking.
: This hasn't proved to be so.

A CD-ROM is a CD-ROM..  I don't see how a CD-ROM with access times of 300-350
ms and transfer rates of 500kb/s can hardly be much faster depending on the
type of bus, SCSI or IDE..  Use your head.

Anyways, I doubt your going to get many answers..  <sorry>   You seemed to 
have known it was a debate, and evidently it really is...  :)

Good luck.

it certainly is not necessary to use seperate partitions for / annd /usr.
but there are probably some good arguments for it (i don't know them (except
for a safer root-partition (fs-corruption is more probable on a heavy used
/usr-partition than on a root-partition, which is mainly used at startup)).
i use the same partition for both, and am happy with it....

Part of the answer to this lies in the Xtubes.  If the Xterminal doesn't
have a local(either downloadable or in firmware) window manager the
answer is you can't.  However most of the Xterminals i've worked with
do.

In the .xsession file in each users account we have a line that says:

this file consists of:


#!/bin/sh

As you can tell it tries to guess which terminal it is on and the start

Another (shareware) DOS NFS client is xfs. It is available for anonymous
ftp from

ftp.uni-duisburg.de: /pub/pc/nfs/xfs186.zip

The same directory also contains Tsofts nfs257 and support programs

Subject: Q: XF86-3.1 and font scaling
Date: 7 Oct 1994 09:13:48 GMT

It seems to me that scaling of postscript fonts has changed with
XFree86 3.1. For example, my favourite editor (ez) uses as default
the font -adobe-times-medium-r-normal--*-140-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1
for typesetting text. XFree86 2.1 supplied the font
-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--14-140-75-75-p-74-iso8859-1
in stead, which I have installed in *.pcf.Z format.
XFree86 3.1 in contrast scales the font
-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1,
which I have in *.pfa format (from Adobe Type Manager), to the
appropriate size. In principle, of course, it is just fine that X
now shows exactly the right font (better WYSIWYG with ez).
[Somehow the font specification above seems to be uniquely
defined in spite of all the wildcard characters. I don't know
too much about fonts in X.] The problem is the fact that it now
takes quite a long time for (e.g.) ez to come up the first time,
because the scaling of the fonts requires lots of cpu resources
(in fact, I can't even move my mouse cursor as long X is scaling
the fonts on my i486DX33 ...). And, even worse, when I close
ez and restart it later, X has to do all the scaling again.

Now my questions:

1) Is it true that font scaling has changed with XFree86 3.x (or
   X11R6), or was there just a problem in my font setup before?

2) Is it possible to tell X to scale the most frequently used PS
   fonts when X is started and keep them in memory even when there
   are no applications using them. I didn't find anything about it
   in the manpages.

Thanks a lot for all response,

Subject: Configuring 1.1.8 Kernel error
Date: Fri, 07 Oct 94 08:11:40 PDT


I am trying to build a new kernel with CD-ROM support which wasn't built in. 
I get the following message during the make zImage:

fs/fs.o: Undefined symbol  _ext_read_super referenced from text segment
                           _ifs_read_super referenced from text segment
make *** [ tool/zSystem ] Error


I am new to linux and figure there maybe something I am doing wrong or over 
looking. Any help would be appreciated! Bye the way I'm using the Walnut Creek 
CDROM Toolkit for Linux "stuff".

Thanks....

Subject: [TERM] Some ideas
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 13:30:39 GMT

I finally set up term.  I like it a lot.  I've also set things up now
that I just type "rxvt" at the prompt, and I get a login shell,
automatically.  Likewise for the other clients.  For those who are
interested, here's what I did:

The hardest part is writing an auto-login routine.  The routine has to
deal with (at least on my site) busy modems, modems that don't answer,
modems that answer but don't work, rlogin commands from an annex box
that report "no pty's, try again" etc.  I decided to use a kermit
script.  The problem is that even kermit's advanced scripting commands
aren't enough.  So I redirected kermit's output to a file and
periodically scanned the file for errors or success.  Alas, this trick
means that I can't use "script" in kermit (because for some reason the
output of script never makes it to the log file), only "input."  At
any rate, the general idea is to write a script that starts kermit in
the background, noting its PID.  That script than scans the kermit
output file for any possible errors (BUSY, NO CARRIER, ERROR) until it
finds CONNECT.  If it finds CONNECT, it exits.  Other similar sections
scan for subsequent login errors (no pty's) until a successful login
is achieved.

Here's what I think is the novel part of my setup.  I put all of my
term binaries in a special directory.  They never get run directly.
Rather, I wrote a short shell-script term.any, which I linked to all
of the binaries.  Term.any checks to see if a term connection is
already up.  If it is, it just runs the binary associated with $0.  If
it's not up, it starts a term connection.  I use another directory to
coordination this activity, with files term.is.up, term.is.working or
nothing to indicate the status of term.

Now I can just type "rxvt" and get a shell, no matter what.  Likewise,
I can use "tfinger" whenever I please.

If you want more details, send e-mail.

Subject: TERM: a few questions
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 13:35:51 GMT

I have a few questions about term and termnet.  I got term up and
running a few nights ago (see my previous post), and all of the normal
clients work fine.  I also downloaded termnet, but those clients don't
work.  They fail for various reasons.  XGopher can't find an
initialziation file.  Xarchie silently dies.  Ytalk can't find any
outside addresses, etc.  Some program "cannot find term directory."
Others can.  Are there any docs on these programs.  Where did they
come from?  Where does the term support come from?

Secondly, is is possible to do NFS mounts over term?

Thirdly, I have termncftp running, but I like the ordinary ftp I've
come to know and love.  Are there any versions that will work with
term?

Thanks for any help.
