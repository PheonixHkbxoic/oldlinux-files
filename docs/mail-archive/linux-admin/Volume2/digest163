Hi,

I have been looking around the FTP sites for information about any standards
for daemon accounts in /etc/passwd such as bin,sync,news,news,... and also for
naming of groups such as wheel,root,adm,sys,system,...

Has there been anything discussed with this.  I am quite an experienced linux
hacker and I am for installing linux from peices rather than from a 
distribution such as slackware, actually I have installed the basic slackware
set to get me a bootable machine and from here I have started to hack at 
things as we speak X11R6 is recompiling on it.

Any pointers or suggestions welcome, what entries do commercial versions have
like SunOS, Solaris, SCO,..., I have access to some other Unix systems.

Thanks in advance

Gareth

But Linux _can_ use (read & write) MAC-Floppies !
Look for a thing like xhfs###. I found mine on the
Spring-Infomagic-CD.

But I would like to read MAC-CD's too...

OR have a simple SLIP for MAC
OR at least have a sort of "tree" / "ls -R" on the MAC.

        I believe you can the problem by compiling your kernel with the
'PC/TCP compatability mode " option set.  I think this is available in kernels 
from 1.1.13 and up.  Apparently this does something with the MTU that
PC/TCP likes.

Subject: [Q] ytalk / named / DNS help needed
Date: 8 Oct 1994 13:48:46 GMT

This evening, I tried to use 'ytalk' to talk to a locally attached 'dumb'
terminal.
I did not have my ppp network connection to my service provider up at this
time.

For some reason, it didn't work.  
I got 'Warning: Cannot write to new talk daemon' and 
'Warning: Cannot write to old talk daemon' errors.

I tried it again later, this time with my ppp network connection up and
running, and it worked.

This is what the output of 'route' looks like, first without, then with,
my ppp network connection up and running.

Kernel routing table

default         annex2.clark.ne *               UG    0      0      922 ppp0

The '127.0.0.0' is a 'loopnet' entry in my /conf/net/networks file.


This led me to believe that something is hosed in my configuration files for
my local 'named'.

I've read all the documents I can lay my hands on regarding this subject,
including (r)tfm page, the Linux HOWTO, etc.  Could some kind DNS guru
take a look at these files, and point out the error of my ways ?

Everything else, network wise, works fine.  I have no problems reaching
anywhere else on the net.  

Why, you may ask, am I trying to figure this out, with only my single, 
home, Linux box ?  I intend, at some point in the future, to add another
box or two, and I want to set up my own sub-domain. I know, setting up
the linux box to act as primary name server for my own sub-domain will
be _slightly_ different than what I have now, but that's why I'm trying
to learn to crawl, before I try to walk.

No flames, please.  If there are other documents I should be reading,
PLEASE - point me to them.  I'll gladly do that.  I'd much rather understand
how this works than have someone write me a recipe.  But, if you can point out
what I've done wrong, and tell me what the right way is, and why, I'd sure
appreciate that, too.

Thanks, in advance, for any help.

                     Hi, experts!

I have a few diskless stations and only two questions:

1. Is it possible to arrange
a swap area for them on the remote machine ?

2. Can I use the disk partition from this remote
machine as a local disk on the station (I am not
talking about NFS!) ?

Thank you very much.

I run a system with a large number of users. I recommend splitting off

Which version of sendmail is the fix against? I tried it under sendmail 8.6.9

I dug up my old copy of SLS .99.12 and installed it without too much 
trouble. Now I see everyone discussing 1.50 What are the advantages
to upgrading and what is the least painful way to do it? Is there a
way to just upgrade, or do I need to re-install? I dread the thought 
of downloading all those disks again! 

Will I get SCO Unix binary compatibility with this upgrade? Or is 
that a seperate package I can add to my installation?

That's too bad: they should have included the README for LBX or
something.

I enclose the README from the LBX distribution in X11R6 below, hopefully
that will answer your questions...

                                Low Bandwidth X
                                     (LBX)

This tree contains a snapshot of the code for Low Bandwidth X, the effort to
develop a standard for running X applications over serial lines, wide-area
networks, and other low-bandwidth, high-latency transports.  While many of
the major pieces of the eventual standard are represented here, LBX is *not*
done yet; this code should be treated as an "alpha" or "prototype" for people
who are interested in seeing the overall form that LBX is expected to take.

             ******************************************************

The goal of LBX is to improve the startup time, performance, and interactive
feel of X applications run over low bandwidth transports.  LBX does this by
interposing a "pseudo-server" (called the "proxy") between the X clients and
the X server.  The proxy caches data flowing between the server and the
clients, merges the X protocol streams, and compresses the data that is sent
over the low bandwidth wire.  The X server at the other end uncompresses the
data and splits it back out into separate request streams.  The target is to
transparently make many X applications usable over 9600 baud modems.

This code snapshot contains the following features:

    o   LZW compression of the binary data stream.  Since commercial use
        of LZW requires licensing patented technology, we are also looking
        for an unencumbered algorithm and implementation to provide as well.

    o   Delta compression of X packets (representing packets as "diffs"
        against previously sent packets).

    o   Re-encoding of some graphics requests (points, lines, segments,
        rectangles, and arcs).

    o   Motion event throttling (to keep from flooding the wire).

    o   Caching of data in the proxy for large data objects that otherwise
        would be transmitted over the wire multiple times (e.g. properties,
        font metrics, keyboard mappings, connection startup data, etc.).

    o   Short-circuiting of requests for constant data (e.g. atoms,
        colorname/rgb mappings, and read-only color cells).

However, the following items have yet to be implemented (which is why it
isn't a standard yet...):

    o   Re-encoding of a number of requests (e.g. QueryFont), events, etc.

    o   Support for BIG-REQUESTS extension.

    o   A non-networked serial protocol for environments which cannot
        support os-level networking over serial lines.

    o   A full specification needs to be written describing the network
        protocol used between the proxy and the server.

The LBX team is continuing to work on both the implementation of the remaining
items and the full specification.  The goal is to have all of the pieces ready
for final review by the public later this year.  Since the specification for
LBX *will* change, vendors are discouraged from building products based on
this prototype.

However, everyone is strongly encouraged to work with the code, examine the
concepts, comments on alternatives, and volunteer to help finish it up!

[[ ..removed... ]]

                                     Usage

Start the X server as usual, and then start the proxy.  The lbxproxy
is a pseudo-server, so any clients that wish to use it need to adjust
their DISPLAY.  By default, the proxy will listen on hostname:1.
This can be changed by using the ':portnum' argument.

Example:

If the proxy is to be running on a host named "sharedhost", connecting
to an LBX-capable X server on a desktop machine named "mydesktop", you 
could use the following command to start the proxy (which would be 
known as display "sharedhost:7"):

    mydesktop%  rlogin sharedhost
    sharedhost%  lbxproxy -display mydesktop:0 :7 &
    sharedhost%  xclient -display sharedhost:7

programs/lbxproxy/design contains rough design notes for the implementation.  
More detailed comments can be found in the code.

I read an article in a recent Unix magazine that Linux can run SCO
Unix binaries. What do I need to do this? (I have SLS 99.12 installed)

Well, There's GNU cp and "Unix" cp.  If you need to use cp
in a script or an alias, or you frequently find yourself
sitting in front of different types of unix boxes, you may
not want to assume that the cp -a option exists, better to
stick to tar.

Are you sure you want a comma in this sentence?  It reads
a little strange that way.
