1.   Double check that you have the NCR 53c810 driver enabled (53c7,8xx
    in the configuration options).

2.   If the configuration is correct, arround Linux 1.1.41 there were
    a few changes made to the PCI BIOS code which don't work too well on
    some systems.  Try using the kernel/bios32.c from 1.1.39.

That's all right: login bash reads in /etc/profile and .profile .

If you want both, put a . ~/.bashrc at the end of your .profile .

Try a card with a Mach32 chipset, they're about $350 (over here in
Europe), they're lightning fast and you can even find them on ISA !

 For two reasons it should be better to tar first and compress later. 
If you zip first, each zip file will have some overhead that you could be 
repeating hundreds of times. And tarring all the zip files will introduce
tar's overhead (uncompressed) between every file. The other way, all of
tar's header info gets compressed, you don't hvae zip overhead, and you
should also be able to achieve better compression on the one big file than
you can individually on little files (VERY true for tiny files).

Between tarring then zipping versus using zip to contain the directory 
structure I have no idea which is better - why not just try it on "typical"
files?

Have you tried booting Linux with an Tape inserted into the drive? This

Right. NFS/Share is the only NFS-Client for the Macintosh as far as I know.

In later kernels SOCK_PACKET does return outgoing packets.  I can't
give you the exact patchlevel, but I think it's in the late 1.1.30
series.  Check the kernel changelogs generously posted by Russ Nelson
(also available from nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/v1.1).

You can use the keymap that kernel uses for X, too. I installed
Slackware 2.0 a while ago, and found a mk_modmap script in
/usr/lib/kbd/keytables.  I said: mk_modmap sf-lat1.map > ~/.Xmodmap
(might be .xmodmaprc on some distributions) and it works fine.

I didn't catch the beginning of this shutdown thread, but I got advise
on shutting down from runlevel 6 and this is how I did it:
I edited my /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources to look like this 
============== 8< ====================
xlogin*login.translations: #override\
        Ctrl<Key>R: abort-display()\n\
        <Key>F1: set-session-argument(failsafe) finish-field()\n\
        Ctrl<Key>Return: set-session-argument(failsafe) finish-field()\n\
        <Key>Return: set-session-argument() finish-field()\n\
        Ctrl Alt <KeyPress> Delete: abort-display()
xlogin*borderWidth: 3
...
============== 8< ===================

Essentially I added the Ctrl Alt <KeyPress> Delete -line, which means
that when I'm at the login-screen, I press ctrl-alt-del twice in a row
and the system reboots (or whatever it says in  your /etc/inittab...

I like it this way.

Well, in a very important sense, Linux already does have support for
mounting disks written in different or entirely-novel formats.  It's
called "userfs".  It's not a part of the standard kernel;  it's a
separate loadable module which requires almost no kernel hacking at all
to install (a patch to one file of exportable symbols).

I used userfs-0.8 (recently released) to mount a CD-ROM written in the
3DO "Opera" format.  Using one of the example userfs clients as a
starting point, it took me one day of coding to complete the job, mount
an Opera CD-ROM, export it via NFS, and automount it from my Sun
workstation.  About half of this one day was waiting for my 386SX-16 to
compile the code (g++ is a slug on this machine!).

Writing a client for the Mac HFS format would be more work, in part
because it'd be necessary to figure out what to do with the Mac's Finder
information and resource forks.  Probably make 'em appear as a set of
AppleDouble directory hierarchies, I'd think (although AppleSingle, CAP,
or MacBinary would be equally possible, although not equally easy to
implement).

Doing read/write support for HFS would be trickier.  Doing it _right_
would be trickier yet.

Doing _any_ support for the Mac's 800k disk format is probably
infeasible... I believe it uses a form of MFM encoding that the
electronics in a standard 1.44-meg floppy drive will not handle.

It took me another day to hack together a way to run CAP on my Linux
machine (it uses a modified UAR as a network interface, and tunnels IP
packets to a Sun running UAR which then routes them to EtherTalk).  It's
an ugly approach, but it does work with a stock Unix kernel and network
stack.

At some point (i.e. about 30 seconds after the guys out there get a
PowerPC port of Linux working) it'll be highly desireable to be able to
mount Linux and HFS partitions from a single hard drive.  I believe
it'll happen, although I'm not going to bet on when.

Well, this is nasty. You start shutsown from an xterm, and shutdown starts
to kill everything. As soon as it kills the X server or the xterm or
the shell running in the xterm, it pulls its own ground away and dies.
So your system gets no shutdown, but can maybe end up in a state where
some important processes are already killed.

Now, linux gurus, I know, one has to issue shutdown from a vc to avoid this,
but, Isn't there a way to do this also from X? Would be very comfortable...
Maybe shutdown could fork(), detach from all open files and could start
to kill everything until itself is only left. The output could automagically
go to /dev/tty1.
I am too busy to do that on my own right now, but I think lotsa people will
kiss your feet (: if you (yes, you!) have enthusiasm to do it (:

Please, don't tell me about accidentally halting the system... I think if
someone accidentally types shutdown, it's his own fault, and he can still
use the old method if he wants to.
