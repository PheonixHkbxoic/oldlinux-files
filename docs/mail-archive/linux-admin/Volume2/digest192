I really can't imagine how to setup C news accidentally. You have to manipulate
the crontab, for example. To know this, you most probably will read the
README file (in /usr[/local]/lib/news, in most Linux distributions).
In this file, there's also the mailname, organization,... setup described.

I think that's a standard problem: people don't read [all of] the
documentation.

no problem (using my linux box 1.0.9 I believe) but on the return, all
incoming mail goes to the /var/spool/smail/input directory and I get

Subject: Optimizing CSLIP performance via kernel TCP parameters
Date: 13 Oct 1994 11:49:33 GMT




Hello

Recently I succeeded in getting cslip to work between Linux and a
SUN IPX by installing cslip-2.7 on the SUN end. To improve performance
the CSLIP documentation  recommends reducing the default TCP buffer
sizes on the dialup client side (i.e. my Linux box). Does anyone know
how to do this since I couldn't find any reference to the parameters
tcp_sendspace and tcp_recvspace (mentioned in the CSLIP guide) in
my Linux kernel code.

Finally, it was recommended in the CSLIP docs to make the retransmit
timer more conservative and an example was given on how to do this using
the 4.3-tahoe networking code. Could anyone tell me how to do this 
in Linux? Any other suggestions for optimizing my CSLIP link would be
greatly appreciated.

                        many thanks

                               Jerry

Known problem.

Install /pub/Linux/system/Network/daemons/portmap_3_rpcfix.shar.gz
to fix the (libc 4.5.25) bug which caused this.  While you're at
it, install the rest of the package for a more secure system ;-)

You have to use /dev/nftape for this:

Only Intel uses STUPID names for their chips.  AMD will produce a DX3/120

What kind of crap is that???   Sure I realize that a lot of people do
go around and break into systems, but I have found that a whole hell of
a lot of the security problems are discovered by system admistrators
that are the types of people who have open minds and have a habit of 
trying to do every possible combination of a configuration for a 
program or server just to make sure it's as bug free as possible. A
good sysadmin who really wants his users to have a very efficient
system will make sure everything runs right,  and this means that 
they are very likely to find bugs eventually.  Those people that call
themselves system adminstrators, but actually just copy other
peoples configurations with no knowledge of how they work, typically
don't have enough knowledge of what they are running to realize that 
there is a security problem and how to either fix it or duplicate so
they can repair the problem.

There are some things that I am very good at and can find problems with,
then there are some things that I have no idea how it works (Smail is
one of those that I'm not familiar enough with realize if something
is wrong), but whenever I hear about a security problem I want to
know how I can check if it exists or not.  Just saying "Smail has a
security problem" doesn't help me any.  Either do one of 2 things,
tell everyone what the problem is in detail so system administrators
can try it and see if their systems are at risk and they can try to 
fix it,   or give out the patch or the fix with the original message
of the problem.

I'm one of those people that find illegal hackers and turn them in
and believe that laws aren't strict enough against it, and I also
find security problems in programs too while maintaining local
systems.  I actually take your comment as an insult to system
adminstrators that try to make things better since they are the
ones who report the bugs that you see on here.  I doubt an illegal
hacker is going to give out their 'secrets' in this list anyways.

Subject: strange lockups, bizarre networking...
Date: Mon, 10 Oct 1994 00:40:14

As was posted several days ago, my machine is one of those which has been 
having strange lockups the past weeks.  Basically, when I upgraded from 1.1.10 
to 1.1.45 (and now 1.1.50), my system will occasionally hang hard.  A 
power-reset is the only thing to bring it back.

Another person sent me a possible fix, claiming that it may be a portion of 
the ne.c code (the system does use an NE2000 clone). However, that patch did 
not stop the lockups from occuring.  I suppose I may need to invest in another 
network card...

Before doing that, though, I thought it might be beneficial to the Linux 
developers if I told them some more about the symptoms we've been having 
lately.

Usually, there are 4-5 machines active on the network.  3-4 WfWg machines, and 
1-2 Macs.  The Linux machine is a Dell 486, 720 MB IDE drive (w/ 30MB SWAP), 8 
MB RAM, and an NE2000 card.  The Linux machine is also connected to a 28.8 K 
modem, and runs DIP to connect our LAN to the internet.  It is connected to an 
additional modem and runs FlexFax.  Finally, the machine also runs SAMBA to 
serve files/printers to the WfWg machines.  I am currently working on making 
CAP work, and at times it is running some CAP processes -- but usually not for 
very long.  And in any event, running CAP is not consistent with the times the 
machine hangs.

Finally, one more bit of information.  Often times the hangs are preceded by 
periods of sluggish network performance.  My telnet logins to the machine will 
simply sit there as I type commands, then eventually they'll work.

Also, tonight something VERY strange happened.  My Linux machine stopped 
responding to my LAN, so I ran "arp -a".  Only two machines were listed, but 
both had a hardware address of 00:00:00:00:00:00.

It looked like this:

Address                 HW type               HW address              Flags 
(ip of machine 1)   10Mbps Ethernet   00:00:00:00:00:00       C
(ip of linux box)     10Mbps Ethernet   00:00:00:00:00:00

Running it now, arp still reports 00:00:00:00:00:00 for the linux machine 
(itself that is) -- I don't know if that is correct or not.  It does, however, 
have the correct address for the other machine now, and it has it's own 
correct address when I run "ifconfig".

Anyway, these are the facts.  If any of the developers can figure out how to 
get around these hangs, I (and several others I know) would be greatly 
appreciative.  I hope that this information will help, and if I can be of any 
more assistance, please let me know.

Thanks!

Oh, criminals.  Give me a break.  The criminals are the ones that mess with
things.  I consider myself a (wannabe, at least) hacker in the original 
sense, and in HS was a "hacker" in the new sense.  I never altered 
ANYTHING.  I got in, to get in, or to use a compiler.  Nothing criminal about 
that (except in the eyes of the law.)  Penetrating the security of a 
computer system is totally harmless in and of itself.  It's the defacing 
of what one finds, or the spreading of info that are the problems, and 
have made folks so paranoid they 'throw the book' at anybody who pokes around 
a little.  Hey, I'm gonna see where I can go.  I also understand, as the owner
of a system about to be on the net, the paranoia, and will surely bounce 
anyone who gets on my system off as quickly as I can, not knowing that they 
are as nice as I am.   (I even had operators do poor jobs of throwing me off, 
which pissed me off, because understimating your 'enemy' is stupid, and the
worst I ever did (once) was get back on, do a stop proc /id=blahblah (VMS) and
abdicate.  Just to let him know he screwed up and his back was wide open and
somebody nasty could have caused him some trouble. ) But I will never attempt
to get someone in legal trouble who has not destroyed something.  This
'throw the book at them' mentality for poking around is pathetic and
(overused cliche word.) fascist.   True, a lot of these system crackers
are malicious little bastards, the same sort who write viruses (or would if
they could), but judging intent before an action is a pathetic reaction in
the direction of security over liberty.  I fully understand the worries
involved here.  But the criminalization of the curious is pathetic and
computer-bureaucrat-like.  Let's reserve the word 'criminal' for those 
who break things.  What I generally did after I got in was tell the op. 
what I did and how I did it and ask for a user account (in exchange for
the niftier root or SETPRV, READALL, etc account I had.)   A fairly
helpful little vermin, I was.   I despised anyone who deleted or defaced
anything, as did most of the (good) "entry experts" of the time.  This was
say ten years ago.    

>original meaning of the word.  To refer to such people as `hackers' is to
>give them a dignity they do not deserve.

Depends on how ingenious their attempts to enter a system are.  This is a
dogmatic view.  "Hacker" and "non-malicious-system-tourist" are not non-
intersecting sets.  Back in HS i performed entries that qualified as hacks.  

Today?  There is enough to do without entering other people's systems.  I've
got a Linux box that beats the crap out of 99% of the systems I used to 
want to get into. (why get in?  I often wanted a c compiler.  not gonna 
get that on an apple II+.)  Also, there are 50 bizillion fascist hardass
computer bureaucrats waiting to hurl that book.  Also, there is the risk of
being identified with the aforementioned malicious little 
you-know-whats.  Barring that, I might still poke around.  Curiosity is not
a crime.

/usr/bin/passwd is not setuid in the slackware 2.0.1 installation.

to fix:

1) login as root.
2) cd into /usr/bin
3) chmod u+s passwd

It will now work.  

Why it didn't work:  To be able to write /etc/ptmp and then update
/etc/passwd, your must be root.  So passwd is executed setuid, which
means it is run as if it had been started by root.  (To see this for
yourself, start passwd and then run ps aux--it will show up owned by
root.)  This allows all the necessary files to be created/changed/updated.

Reply-To: BruceBigby@Aol.com
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 1994 17:06:36 GMT

Recently, I purchased Yggdrasil (RevB?) and am awaiting its arrival in the mail.
I have a multifunction board, called the ACE 5000, from Best Data Products
in CA.  The board is fantastic!  It features a DSP (Digital Signal Processor)
MWave Technology for excellent voice/sound reproduction, MIDI features (16
instruments), a 14.4k Data modem/FAX (software upgradeable to 28.8k),
and is Soundblaster 16-bit compatible.  It also has a Panasonic-compatible
interface for CDROM and support that enables you to connect the audio of
another CDROM to it so that ACE applications can process its audio, but I don't
use the feature since I purchased an inexpensive Sony CU33A CDROM and
interface board.  Here are my questions:

        1. Under Windows, I access the modem features of the board by running
        one of several modem applications:  2400B through 14.4kB.  Once the
        modem "driver" is running, communications applications access it
        through COM3.  The COM port is configurable.  The modem application
        is Hayes compatible, of course.  Is there a driver for the ACE
        that exists!  It is a fairly new board.

        2. I recently purchased a Sony 2X CDROM, because it was very cheap.
        Under DOS, it is not in interrupt mode because I don't have any
        spare IRQs, unless I do some major reconfiguring.  Do I need to
        have my CDROM drive in interrupt mode for Linux to recognize it?  If
        so, here is my next question:

        3. My CDROM can use IRQs 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9.  I have a bus mouse that
        accompanies my ATI Ultra Graphics Plus video adapter/accelator; it
        is Mach 32-based.  I do not use the mouse because I already have a 3-button
        Logitech serial mouse that is on COM1, IRQ4.  I can free up this
        serial port if I use the bus mouse.  Does Yggdrasil Linux have a 
        bus mouse driver built in?  Will it detect it upon installation?  I
        am not sure whether it is PS/2 compatible.  I suppose it is.  Can
        I simply use IRQ9?  MSD says that this is a redirected IRQ2.  What
        does this mean and is IRQ9 available or is it off limits?  I suppose,
        under LINUX, I could use IRQ9, but this might screw up DOS...any
        takers?

        4. I do have a second modem, a Telebit Trailblazer, that currently
        is taking up COM2/IRQ3.  I suppose if I use this modem, instead of the
        ACE 5000 modem feature, I won't need to worry about obtaining a
        driver for the ACE.  I would like to get rid of this modem, but may
        keep it anyway.  If I can get rid of it, I can setup my CDROM to use IRQ3.
        If not, I must keep it since I might not be able to access the modem
        features of my ACE.

Much thanks for replies.

Not if you're using the -i option, ignore bad block. Tar tries to resync
in case of checksum errors.

Hope this helps

Yeah, have a look at /etc/resolv.conf. There might be a reference to an
unknown name server. Looking up this name server gives a timeout, that's
(perhaps) your delay. Also have a look at /etc/host.conf whether bind
or nis is referenced. If there's no name server (and no nis for that 
matter) you might as well delete these key words, leaving only hosts
(for looking in /etc/hosts).

Maybe when /proc/mtab is in wide use, and most people get into the
