Physically it slows it down so that the streaming is disturbed, so the
tape will not hold as much data and the volume/minute may drop
drastically.

Logically, you are taking a high risk option. One error on the tape will
make it impossible to recover anything after that point, since the whole
file is one compressed stream. It is better to use something like afio,
which is a cpio clone with file-by-file compression. If your DAT tape
already compresses (as many do) then don't do any more software
compression; the software will compress better but you will loose the
speed and transparency benefit of the hardware option.

That is normally called a 'static' allocation. Each user is given one
and only one IP address. Each user has a unique signon which maps to
one specific IP address.

The term 'dynamic' usually means that when the same user signs on at
different times, a different IP address is assigned. The IP address is
obtained from a pool of values and is not bound to a specific user.

>However, SCO hosts seem to have

The telephone number is not a function of the IP assignment. It is
used by your local PBX and the central switching station at the
telephone company to connect to a specific pair of wires.

The easiest method of doing dynamic IP assignment is to have the
telephone company or the local PBX do a 'rotary' system. It will have
one number into which all of the calls arrive. The rotary system finds
the first non-busy 'telephone' (modem) and connects there. The modem
maps to a serial port. The serial port maps to a tty device. The tty
device maps to a unique _remote_ IP address. Then when a user calls
the one number, the call is connected to to first first available tty
device. This gives you a different IP address with each call.

>Now, given that a link can be uniquely defined by the pair 
><local IP>:<remote IP>, is it possible to have all the lines with the
>same local IP address and just vary the remote IP addresses.

Yes. The routing is performed based upon the remote IP address. You
may use the same local IP address for all connections.

Your local IP address will be the remote IP address to the remote
system. However, since their frames will be sent to your server based
upon the IP address, you need to make it a legal value. Don't use
addresses such as 0.0.0.0 or 127.*. A good choice for the local IP
address on the server is one of the IP addresses associated with the
network cards.

Ok. I've done this.

Hi there !
The dosemu 0.52 will work with kernel versions <= 1.1.29 !
If you want to use the kernel 1.1.52, you will have to get
the new 0.53 kernel. You can find it on
tsx-11 in the ALPHA/dosemu/development directory.

Hope that helps

Subject: PPP indirectly??
Date: 12 Oct 1994 09:25:42 GMT

I am interested in setting up a PPP link to put my linux box on the 
internet.  I used to live in a location where I had root access to a 
machine on the internet and I have since moved to a place where I just 
have dial-up access.  Would it be possible for me to set up the PPP 
client on my Linux box and then dial-up -> telnet into the machine that I 
have root privledges on to complete the PPP connection (I dont think this 
is possible without some sort of mod to the code or addition).  Any 
assistance would be greatly appreciated.
                                        Thanks

I tracked down the error and fixed it on my platform.
The problem is in lmail.c.  There are two lines 
in the code:

... if(fputs( ...) != strlen( ...)) which is wrong.

The correct syntax is:

... if (fputs( ...) < 0)  which is correct.

Should I upload a corrected mail.c to sunsite?

        No, even on systems with one drive SCSI is a better choice than IDE
unless you are running a single-tasking OS like DOS. It is definately
possible to get transfer speeds out of IDE that are close to SCSI (but not
Fast & Wide SCSI). But you are paying for the speed with CPU busy waiting.
While SCSI may not be a winner in terms if transfer when one disk is
concerned, it will definately make a difference on slower machines in terms
of CPU impact.

Subject: smail configuration woes...
Date: 12 Oct 1994 05:50:57 GMT
Reply-To: doug@interaccess.com

I'm currently connecting to the internet via a dialin PPP connection.  I've
configured smail to route mail through my PPP host as a smart_host (I'm using
it right now), but it only works if I'm actually connected via PPP.  If I
try to send mail while I'm not connected, I get the following:

|------------------------- Failed addresses follow: ---------------------|
 lenz@comm.mot.com ... transport smtp: connect: Network is unreachable
|------------------------- Message text follows: ------------------------|

I've tried using the 'retry' file and durations in my smail config, but it
insists on dying if my PPP connection is not up when I try to send mail.

Is there ANY way to be able to have smail retry sending mail if the smtp
connection is down?

Right now I've kludged it my having smail only queue mail. Then when I start
up my PPP connection, I enable smail to process the queue in the background.
When I shut down my PPP connection it likewise kills smail so that it won't
try sending anything.  Certainly there must be a better way.

ANY help would be appreciated (I can forward my config files if needed).

Thanks in Advance!

Hah.  Apparently you didn't hear that the Am486 DX/2 66 could be safely
over-clocked to run at 80Mhz.  All the DX2-80 is is a relabeled DX2-66.
That's why it's not much more expensive.  It's the same chip.  Anyone wanna

clocked? :)

The chip is manufactured (here in Austin, I might add) by Advanced Micro 
Devices (AMD).  It is an internally clock-doubled 33MHz CPU, just like the
i486DX2-66.  As far as I know, there are no 'real' 66 MHz chips.  The pin-out
is identical to the Intel; it is supposed to work in Intel 486-compatible
motherboards, although from experience this is not always the case.

I am running Linux 1.1.45 on a mystery motherboard (UMC chipset) with an AMD
486DX2/66 with no problems, although my first motherboard choice (OPTi chipset)
had trouble when I upgraded the cache from 64K to 256K.  Older versions of the
chip reportedly had problems with Ghostscript, but gs (and everything
else) runs just fine on mine.  Be sure to get one with the MS Windows-
compatible logo on it; these are newer and more compatible, and you can cover
up the logo with a heatsink!

dosemu 0.52 is working on my machine with kernel 1.1.45.  However i can
start it up if I do it from an Xterm.  If i start at the console the I'll get 
a black screen.  Could this be one of the problem?

Hmm.  Its worth noting that of this list, 

I) The plans to a Nuclear device ARE freely available.  All the
information needed is in non-classified papers.  In fact, an A-bomb's 
plans were assembled many years ago by a college student as a research 
project.  The plans for an H-bomb werer printed in Progressive magazine.  
the governtment DID try to stop Progressive from printing the arival but 
the courts (rightly in my opinion) ruled that in our society the 
government may NOT impede the publishign of information as long the 
sources for that information were legal, which in this case they were.

II) Medical History -- Freely available from the Medical Information Board
(MIB).  Insurance companies report into this database, and then
organizations who are members (like those self same insurance companies)
can request a file on any one of us.  (Thats how an inusrance company
tracks down things like pre-existing conditions.)

I'm not saying I necessarily agree that these points bear back to the 
debate at hand.  Frankly, I think the analogy was rather strained...

Mr. Shenk, you are _simply_ (and completely) WRONG!  Privacy is a _very_  
significant thing.  You are advocating a way of life that leaves people no  
choice but to completely conceal their private information within their own  
heads.

If I simply walked up to your front door, picked the lock, opened the door,  
and then walked away -- would you feel any less secure?  I'll bet you'd  
figure out how to put a better lock on the door.  When people put password  
protection on their systems, it is simply a means to prevent _unwanted_  
access to their systems.  People know (most of them anyway) that the password  
protection is no more of a guarantee than a deadbolt on the front door, but  
it is an attempt -- with the tools at hand.  When you break that protection,  
you have violated their _wishes_ (100% of the time -- not even 99%),  
otherwise they wouldn't have placed the restriction on the system in the  
first place.  Even if they have it _poorly_ protected, that simply says more  
about thier _ability_ to protect the system -- not about thier intentions.

Clearly, you have alot to learn about being _human_...
