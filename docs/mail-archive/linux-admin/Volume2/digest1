Yes, it's true that 1.1.x (x >= 20) has longer latency.  Now I'm
testing alternative implementation which uses task queue instead of
timer.  I had 6 ms with test code, and slightly good transfer late.

   In addition to the slower pings, i get a few dropped
   packets, this is with a 486/66 connected to a (much much slower)
   386/33.  I understand the I must make the timeouts on the faster machine
   longer, right?

Yes.  You can change timeout constant by `plipconfig' utility.  It is
in the net-tools by Alan Cox.

If you want to test my alternative implementation, please mail me.

From the NET-2-HOWTO:

    I see a lot of overrun errors on my slip port, why ?

    The older network tools incorrectly report number of packets
    compressed as the number of packets overrun. This has been
    corrected, and shouldn't occur of you are running the new
    version kernel and tools. If it still is it probably indicates
    that your machine isn't keeping up with the rate of data
    incoming. If you are not using 16550AFN UARTs then you should
    upgrade to them. 16450, or 8250 generate an interrupt for every
    character they receive and are therefore very reliant on the
    processor to be able to find time to stop what it is doing an
    collect the character from them to ensure none get lost. The
    16500AFN has a 16 character FIFO, and they only generate
    interrupts when the FIFO is nearly full, or when they have had
    character waiting, this means that less interrupts get generated
    for the same amount of data, and that less time is spent
    servicing your serial port. If you want to use multiple serial
    ports you should mandatorily upgrade to 16550AFN UARTs anyway.

   How can it be too easy to change the boot password?  Is there a security hole
   in the system (if so, I'd like to know!).  Taking the cover off and shorting
   the battery is the only method I know of.

There are several msdos based cmos backup and manipulating utilities available.
Backup your cmos. Thumber the backuped code. Restore it to cmos. And an error
has occured in cmos, which allows to setup your cmos again. And you can set
it up to boot from a as well as but your own passwd to it.

Subject: Slip server problem FIX
Date: 30 Aug 94 14:17:01 GMT


  I posted a request for help recently and got several good replies.
Here's a sumary so that all may share:

  Problem: Client to SLIP server interaction works fine but it does
not work with any other host.

  Solution:  IP packets are like not being routed to your client.
So what you need to do is use Proxy ARP.  You would do this by using
the following command (as root) on the SLIP server:

     arp -s client_IP hw_addr pub

where client_IP is the IP address of your slip client, hw_addr is
the hardware ethernet address of your ethernet card and pub which is
a flag to arp, meaning publish.  The hw_addr is displayed by a
recent version of ifconfig (type ifconfig with no parameters) but if
you don't have a recent version (like me), it's usually written on
your ethernet card.
   Also you can refer to a section in the NET-2 howto on Proxy ARP.

  Put the above command (when all is happy, joyful, and working)
into some suitable file like rc.local.

   Perhaps this will help other SLIP(/networking) neophytes cope :-)

Yes.
At our University we're running a Novell Netware network over Ethernet.
And we're connected to the internet. All PC's and Apples do have an
internet number. If you're not connected to the internet you can
choose the IP numbers yourself, otherwise you have to ask for a domain 
number at an international organization (don't ask me which).
Either you then setup a nameserver for your net, or you use raw IP
numbers. From every host you can connect to your linux box either
by telnet or ftp. You can mount directories by using shareware nfs
(look at simtel) printing on your box or on other boxes (lpr from
ncsa; lp-demon for Apples - I'm using this for printing postscript
files on our laserwriter IINT) and so on.
Check NCSA Telnet for DOS and Apple; Gopher clients HTTPdemons
and whatever you can imagine.
Hope this helped,
cheers, Sebastian

You might want to check in your CMOS setup program.  There may be an option

It is in the "standard" distributions as well as wuarchive's flavour BUT
this is not a problem. ftpd, after it obtains the caller's identity, does a
chroot to its own ftp directory. All that needs to be done is to create a
'bin' subdirectory of that and COPY (not link) ls into it. Do similarly with

The best way that I've found for a site that doesn't support 
automatic tar'ing of directories is through the use of a 
script rftp written for expect 

Expect is a program that performs programmed dialogue with 
other interactive programs.

Expect can be FTP'd from: ftp.cme.nist.gov  
in the file /pub/expect/expect.tar.Z

the rftp script (included in expect.tar) allows you to
recursively get and put directory structures!
