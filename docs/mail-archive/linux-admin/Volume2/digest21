Subject: NEC 210/SB16 SCSI2 Problem
Date: Sun, 4 Sep 1994 00:55:25 GMT

I recently purchased the Slackware release of Linux from Walnut Creek. The
problem is that I can't mount my NEC 210.  I'm using a SB16-SCSI2.  What
this seems to amount to, according to HOWTOs/FAQs is that the card cannot
be autodetected so I entered aha152x=0x340,11,7,1 on the command line.  
Unfortunately I still can't mount the drive.  The best I can do is to get
a "Not a block device" message. I scanned through various areas of internet
and saw a message about recompiling the scsi driver with parity checking
disabled.  I'm not exactly sure how to do that can anyone help?

[ Posted on 4 Sep 1994 01:35:51 GMT ]

Hello all. First, I wish to thank all those who helped me out with my 
uugetty problem. I got 8 responses, some containing the solution. :)

Now I would like to know if there is a good accounting software for 
Linux. I checked sunsite.unc.edu and found acct-1.1.18, but I am running 
kernel 1.1.45. Is there any accounting software that I can use on this 
kernel? I could move down to 1.1.18, but I don't see linux-1.1.18.tar.gz 
anywhere on sunsite, which implies I would need to get 1.1.0 and apply a 
bunch of patches or some other nonsense. acct-1.1.18 is a patch itself, 
which is why it won't work with 1.1.45. It finds several differences in 
the code. I tried recompiling the kernel anyway, and it didn't get very 
far at all. I am not nearly good enough at C to resolve the differences 
myself. Thanks for any info you can provide.

Even this will be very difficult (if not impossible) if your system
is configured properly. You can set the restricted attribute in
your lilo.conf, and it will be impossible to enter singleusermode
without knowing the bootpw.

Yes... check your termination!  Suns (SPARCs particularly) are very lax 
about needing termination on external devices and thus it's not uncommon
to see the scsi bus flapping about in the wind with the system working
properly.... If Linux ids the device at boot time (it's answering an
identify command) that does not mean it will operate properly.  The
symptoms you describe sound like what happened to me when I accidentally
knocked an external cable loose between scsi devices.

Also, these devices are VERY picky about cleanliness... make sure you
regularly clean the heads with an APPROVED soft material head cleaner...
not the type you find in video stores!

Hope this helps!

Sorry to dissapoint you - old, old fact: many systems limit password to 8 
characters; you'll notice all your passwords are too long, which is the 
real problem - nothing to do with numbers or letters or anything like that.

For this reason system admins should probably be telling people to _precede_
their passwords with all the special CRACK foiling characters ...

Subject: Timing out connections?
Date: Sun, 4 Sep 1994 04:00:45 GMT

I know this has been asked, but I may have missed the answer. Is there a 
way if someone dials into the system, and then goes on vacation, to have 
the system hang them up? Of course, the key is to identify that there is 
no activity going on. I read in the Korn Shell book by O'Reilly that 
there was a variable TMOUT that could be used for this. I checked and 
don't find any reference to this in slackware documentation. 

If anyone has a script or trap setups, or any solution for that matter, 
could you please email me a copy or point me in the right direction. If 
someone can tell me what to look for I'll write the scripts myself and 
post them.

Date: 02 Sep 1994 09:32:17 GMT

        It's more critical than that: tar is a "block device" archiver, that
means it use N blocks for each file archived with a block size of Nx512 bytes
(default N=20). Suppose you have 100 small files of 512 bytes, each of them will
require one 20x512 bytes long block, 1000kb for them all to be compare with
100x512 = 50kb. 

        If you first archive files, then compress the archive file, gzip will
well compress the lost space at the end of blocks. If you first compress then
archive, you will have small files but will never compress the lost spaces !

        The best solution is definitively to use "tar zcf".

Its worked great for me for a long time now.  I did chande the #DEFINE DEBUG
from 1 to 0 to get rid of a lot of messages.

Curious tho, is any development being done or will be done? Or should
I just start looking for a new card?

I tried                 result = request_dma( fdc.dma, "ftape");
But now I wonder if it matters and if one is better than the other?
In /usr/src/linux/kernel/dma.c the function is defined as
int request_dma(unsigned int dmanr, char * deviceID)
which implies to me that a deviceID would be "better".  Since I'm
so new to C, I'll leave it at that :)

I think possibly your traceroute is broken.
When I do the same, it gets to a machine AUTODESK.BARRNET.NET, which

It can definitelyt read all incoming packets on all the cards I use

Ok, got this set of net-tools and have noticed a problem.

/tmp|Sun8:49am} hostname
dial221.tele
/tmp|Sun8:52am} domainname
dial221.tele

Why should domainname not return:

/tmp|Sun8:52am} domainname --domain
tele.iastate.edu

or in my case the true answer would be iastate.edu.

This is what I expect:

domainname -> iastate.edu
hostname -> dial221.tele or dial221.tele.iastate.edu
