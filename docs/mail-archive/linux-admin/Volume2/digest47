        Good suggestion, Woody... It's also a good idea to occasionally run  
crack and the cops programs to hunt for system security weaknesses that may

a few iterations at first to get things all cleaned up, but then running it

Hello Steve,

        This is becoming quite common with the larger IDE drives.  You
have two options, (well, more than that really, but it gets messier!).
First you can make Linux believe the DOSish CMOS description of the
drive (a little complicated) or lose 12 MB of your disk and only use
the first (REAL) 1024 cylinders (SIMPLE).  The simple option first:

SIMPLE:         Boot the machine and interrupt the boot to go to CMOS
                configuration.  On the (usually) base configuration
                screen you will have the disk types (hard drives) 
                listed... yours may be called "user" or 47 for the
                type.  This is where you will find the cylinders, heads,
                and sectors of the device listed.  Only the number of
                sectors is sacred and MUST reflect reality!  The drive
                you have is, in reality, a 1048 cylinder, 16 head, 63
                sector device.  The cylinders and heads have been 
                remapped to satisfy the boot and DOS views of reality 
                which cannot handle more than 1024 cylinders on a device.
                (10 bits for addressing... 2^10 = 1024)  The simple
                fix is to set the cylinders to 1024 and the heads to 16,
                leaving sectors as 63.  This will cost you 24 cylinders
                [or 24*(540/1048) MB], but will insure that everyone
                is looking at the same geometry.  From then on, the 
                install is simple and straightforward.

NOT_SO_SIMPLE:  Leave your CMOS set at cyl=524; sect=63; head=32.
                Boot the Linux boot kernel you've made.  At the FIRST
                prompt, enter the REAL disk geometry (NOT what CMOS
                has set!).  In this case, you would type:
                        ramdisk hd=1048,16,63
                Continue the boot process.  When told to, replace the
                boot diskette with the root diskette you've chosen.
                After Linux comes up, login as root and  invoke
                fdisk.  Assuming this is the first IDE drive you are
                using, type in:
                        fdisk /dev/hda
                When fdisk starts, press "p" to see the existing
                partitions.  Delete any you DON'T need (hopefully in
                this case all of them!)  Next go to expert mode (enter
                an "x")  From the expert menu, change the cylinders
                (type in a "c") to the CMOS setting.  Likewise for
                the number of heads (type in an "h").  Then return
                to the main menu and define your partitions as you
                would normally... with the parameters you"ve set 
                fdisk to use as far as number of heads and cylinders.
                When done, save the new table via the "w" option.
                After the partition table has been updated, continue
                the install using "setup" and all should be fine.  Note
                that when you wish to use fdisk again, you'll have to
                go through this drill all over to force it to buy what
                it sees.  But now Linux, DOS, and CMOS are all seeing
                the same (distorted) view of reality!  :) 
 
        
        Please note that the above techniques work with ANY drive with
        more than 1024 cylinders, just adjust the numbers for cylinders
        and heads as appropriate... i.e. Reduce the number of cylinders
        via a factor to get it below 1024 and then multiply the number
        of heads by this same factor.  DO NOT MESS WITH SECTORS!  This is
        the one piece that actually has to be real!

You need to:

1. Add a new entry in the /etc/services for the new service, like:

my-telnet          9000/tcp

2. Add a new entry in the /etc/inetd.conf for the daemon that will
receive the connection:

my-telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/mtel mtel

Now, the mtel program is a modified in.telnetd that runs your desired
login program instead of /bin/login.

Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 19:26:39 GMT


 Thanks for all of your help....I finally got my swap file
activated.  (Thanks Joerg F, Mikey..etc)


However, I have a problem configuring my sound card.  I have
read all of the doc to no avail.  
I started configuring my sound blaster for SB pro,
did a make depend then make config.  It suddently
halted when it started compiling for sound!!!!

Then I decided to compile the sound stuff myself....
and I had the following errors:

darkstar:/usr/src/linux-1.0.9/drivers/sound# make
cc  -c soundcard.c
In file included from sound_config.h:226,
                 from soundcard.c:31:

sound_calls.h:201: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration,
sound_calls.h:201: warning: which is probably not what you want.
In file included from sound_config.h:227,

IN fact the ultrasound.h and soundcard.h contained the following

#include<linux/soundcard.h>

So I when into linux/soundcard.h and found this!!!!

#include <linux/soundcard.h>      :-(

Something wrong here, does anybody have the 2 correct files handy, 
they could send me.  As an attachment or something.

I really don't want to sound load the whole thing again.
Or if I had too could you give me the filename and ftp site
I could get only the sound stuff.(up-to-date of course)


I need ultrasound.h and soundcard.h.

I am using SlackWare 2.0 (FYI on diskette)

Thanks again for all of your help, I am slowing getting this going!!!

Hello,

I think I read most of the standart (RT)FM, but I cant find a answer to
this problem:

 How can I send a break signal on a serial line?
        (in a C-program) 

And probably, somebody can tell me where to find information like this 
and more (e.g. the detailed use of fcntl and ioctl for programming the
serial interface). My man-pages for those functions are very short,
probably there is more detailed version out now.

I'm trying to communicate with a medical monitor via Linux - you will not
directly save lifes by helping me, but make me happy to continue my work.

Thanks,

   I've read enough about Linux to pique my interest but don't really
know how to get started.  I've downloaded some stuff but it all appears
to be text material.  Shouldn't there be a .com or .exe file like there 
is with Dos or Windows?
   Since I spend some time on a Unix network, I'm somewhat familiar with
it.  I do get a little confused about some of the files I see listed when
I go to download from ftp site (tar, Z, etc.). Are they all handled by
gunzip?

Term is definately the way to go.  You will still need seyon to get the initial
connection. After you are connected, just you will kick off term on the remote 
machine, suspend the seyon program with the "suspend" button, kick off term on
your Linux box, and then start as many trsh sessions as you want.  It's great! 
I highly recommend Mosaic+term too.  Once I got term itself up Mosaic+term went
fine the first time.

I just installed Slackware 2.0,  kernel version 1.0.9, ftape version
0.9.10 (I think ... theres a *0.9.10.patch file in my /boot
directory).  It would not work unless I'm root. Then I chmod a+rw
/dev/ftape from root.  It then worked once, and then no more.  There
must be an obvious answer to this .... thanks in advance for your
help.
