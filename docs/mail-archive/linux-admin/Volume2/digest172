Subject: what's wrong with my agetty?
Date: Sat, 8 Oct 1994 04:45:05 GMT

Hello,
I'm trying to add a dumb terminal to my linux machine.
Here's what I've done so far. I've connected an ADDS terminal
to my comm 3 port via a null modem cable. I placed the following
entry in my /etc/inittab file  s3:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 19200 ttyS2.
I do get a login prompt but when I try to enter anything it takes about
15 seconds for anything to echo back to the dumb terminal. This makes
it take an extremely long time to enter a user name and since passwords
don't echo I can't tell when it's time to enter the next character. If I
ignore the characters not echoing and type in a complete user name, most
of the characters get dropped. I've tried baud rates of 19200, 9600 and 4800
all with identical results. Any suggestions? I appreciate any help I
can get.

Just as a note- you should not use the word "servers" there, but "hosts".

I am not sure what you are asking.  The clients run on the Linux box.
That is the way Xterminals work.  Just think of them as very sophisticated
character terminals.... the more you have, with the more users, the more
the load on the host (the Linux machine).  You will need to meet that 
load by adding additional resources on the host as necessary (more memory,
faster processer, etc).  Or, you can add more hosts to serve the increasing
Xterminal pool (as many as you want).

>How do I get the Linux machine to respond to the XDMCP, but let
>the Xterminals manage their windows ?

What do you mean by "manage their own windows"??  If you mean running the
window manager client, then that is quite possible (through something
called a local client).  But it is usually unnecessary.  The window
manager actually puts very little load on the host compared to other
clients.

>I have tried changing the Xaccess and Xserver files in the

You should *NOT* use the Xserver file (except for the local console)
if you are using XDMCP.  It is unnecessary, and will cause problems.

3. Also it would be nice to receive a FAQ for the linux groups. So
that a posting such as this one shouldn't be sent by me again, wasting

I am currently running ghostscript 2.6.1 and am using lpr2.
lpr2 allows me to print odd and even pages so that  I can 
print on both sides of the page by feeding the paper through
 the printer twice.  However, because of the way the paper is fed 
through the printer, I must reverse the order of the pages after the first
printing of odd pages before printing even pages ( I got a 
Epson Stylus Color ).  This can be a hassle if I am printing a 
200 page manual.

Can anyone tell me how to print in reverse ?

many thanks in advance...

Yes, there is a chip with fit in a "487" socket (which is just a
486DX2/66 with a different pinout).  It disables your old 486, so if
you keep it in the system it is just a very expensive heating element.

Subject: Problems with NCR 810 on MB SA486PAIO
Date: 10 Oct 1994 14:59:47 GMT


I have Problems with installing Linux on my Computer (Motherboard
SA486PAIO, NCR810 onboard, 486DX2/66). I tried to install Linux using
the NCR bootdisk version 3. The problem is that my NCR810 uses interrupt 9
and I'm not able to get Linux to notice that.
When I'm booting it says that it detects the NCR810 on interrupt 11 and
later a test times out due to lost interrupt, saying that I should check
the BIOS setting. That appeares regardeless of the setting I use in BIOS.

So my question is:
Is there a way to get the release 3 of the NCR810 driver to use interrupt 9 ?

I'm running Linux on a 486DX33 with 4Mb of RAM, and a 170Mb

I also need a bigger harddisk. What shall I do:
buy 16Mb of RAM (is it MUCH better than 8Mb) or buy
4MB of RAM and, say 400Md harddisk?

        Hi.  I'm trying to install Linux Slackware 2.0.0 on my machine, 
and am having a bit or a problem.  Here's my stats:

Zeos 486-66
16MB RAM
Western Digital 220MB IDE Hard disk
Adeptec AIC-6360 SCSI Host Adapter
Quantum Empire 1GB SCSI HD
Microcomm Desporte FAST ES 28.8 Modem

        I've installed the SCSI drivers, and everything works peachy thru 
DOS.  I FDISked my 1GB and left about 200MB on it for the Linux Native 
partition.  When I boot Linux, I use the SCSINET boot disk and the 
COLOR144 root/install disk.  It goes thru all it's stuff, and when it 
gets to the SCSI Hosts part, it says "0 SCSI Hosts detected" and "out of 
that 0 are SCSI Hard Disk devices".  

        My Question:  Is there a new driver for Slackware that supports 
the AIC-6360 so that I can FDISK a Linux Native Partition and install the 
system?

        Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!!!

Are you sure it's telnetd that is doing the checking?  I don't know about
the Linux implementation, but similar behavior on SunOS and HP-UX is
because the TCP port never closes.  There is a TCP keep alive timer, but
it just doesn't seem to be in all implementations.

Subject: ftp better, but still freezes with 1.1.52.  Was: ftp freeze problems
Date: 10 Oct 1994 16:21:16 -0400

There has been a lot of talk about ftp freezing.  Alan Cox 
(iialan@iifeak.swan.ac.uk) among others mentioned upgrading to
1.1.19 or higher.  I did, to 1.1.52 (thanks Alan!)

File transfers seem to progress farther now than they did before 
(1.1.18), but still, at some point, ftp freezes up.  For those 
interested, I have a 486/DX-2 66, using a Cardinal internal modem 
(it has a 16550 UART on-board).  The PPP connection is made at
19.2 (V.32terbo). I am connecting to a SunOS box.

Once it freezes up, I can no longer 'ping' my PPP host and 'netstat'
freezes up as well when trying to see what the state of the network
is.   Killing the PPP daemon doesn't help,  as it looks like kernel's
idea of the state of the network is pretty munged at this point, so I
have no other recourse but reboot.

Damn!  I had the output from /usr/adm/syslog, but seem have to have 
misplaced it!  Bummer.  Anyway, I noticed that what was getting logged
were the same kinds of errors as previously under 1.1.18 (and 1.09 BTW).
From memory, these were a series of ioctl errors.  I'll post'em if any-
one is really interested.

Curiously, I have a co-worker who is able to connect to the same (Sun)
machine using 1.1.18 with no apparent problems.  There are so many layers
where there might be problems, from all the software layers down to 
possible physical connectivity problems, this seems like a nasty one to
figure.

My 'gut' feel is that this seems like some kind of cummulative error, 
buffers not being reset or counters not being reset between transfers or
some such 'silly' bug; although I have done zip for testing to confirm 
this.  Under 1.1.18 it would seem to choke on any files over 50K, or 
after transfering several smaller files, would eventually then choke on 
even a smallish file.

Under 1.1.52, I have transfered 300+ Kb files no problem, but then, after 
enough transfers, it freezes up.  Again, I haven't done any testing to see
if 'binary' or 'ascii' modes have any effect.  I also see what I assume to
be the same behavior while using Mosaic: hangs in middle of display how
many bytes of its http request it has recieved.

Anyway, anyone have any other ideas/fixes and/or similar 'gut' feelings 
about this?

Subject: Smail: How to set sender name?
Date: 06 Oct 1994 07:20:08 GMT

Hi -

I am trying to configure smail to send out mail messages with a sender
name which is different than my login name.  I need to do this because
I cannot receive mail on my local machine -- I use a SLIP connection.

I need to make mail messages appear as though they were sent from the
machine which actually receives my mail so that people will be able to
reply to them.

I've figured out part of this problem -- by setting the "visible_name"
attribute in the config file I can make messages appear as though they
were sent from my mail-receiving machine.  

The problem is, however, that the messages are still sent out with my
local username.  My username on my local machine is different from my
username on the mail-receiving machine.

From reading the smail(5) man page, it looks as though I may be able
to do what I want by setting the sender_env_variable attribute in the
config file.  This attribute is supposed to let users change the
sender name used in a mail message by setting an environment variable.
Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work -- smail doesn't seem to use
this attribute.

I've also tried setting the from_field and return_path_field
attributes to produce the desired username, but messages still arrive
with the local username instead of the one I specify.


Can someone tell me how to set the sender name in smail?

I'm using Smail3.1.28.1 #28.5.


Thanks!

-Andy

Yeah, and I guess it's alright to break into somebody's house to watch TV, or
use the phone (local calls only, of course), or take a nap on the couch.  As
long as you don't deface anything.  But those darn eyes of the law...

Look, people set up security on their systems because they don't want
unauthorized users ("nice" or not) on their systems.  And these people have a 
right to have their systems left alone.  When you break into their systems, you
are violating their rights, as well as breaking the law.  In fact, that's why
the laws exist, not to piss you off, but to protect people who want to be left
alone.  When you violate their rights, you deserve to have the book thrown at 
you, as much as a person breaking into a house does.

This goes for any system, whether a one man operation, or a large corporation. 
People have a right to say who is allowed on their system, and who isn't.  I
don't see how you can claim to have a right to break into a system.

Just 2 more cents,
