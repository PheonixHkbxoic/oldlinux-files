Hmmm.... the only performance penalty I got when printing without irq was
that it always took about 2 seconds to resume printing when the printer was
out of paper or had another error. Printing itself was fast.

But anyway, it is surely possible that the cpu may get loaded with the polling
driver. That didn't hurt me, personally, even on the slow 386/40 8MB.
I would prefer using the interrupt for another serial port, since it is more
needed there.

You should be fine by leaving the interrupt jumpered on both the serial and
the printer port. If Linux uses the lp-polling driver, it should not enable
printer interrupts in the hardware (is that true folx?), so there is no
interfering with the com port.

I got no problems with an interruptless printer on dos, note that the first
printerport on monochrome adapters didn't have an interrupt, so dos still
does not use it, and windows should still have drivers which don't use it.

Just my few ...

I'm going to be setting up some kind of backup system on my Linux box,
and I'm wondering if anyone has gotten ftape to work. I haven't really
tried, but I heard some comments that it didn't work or was difficult
to set up. Are they true?

Also, any recommendations on what to get to back-up a 1GB drive (all
Linux ext2)? I was thinking about using a Colorado Jumbo 250, but
that'll take several tapes to backup. Are there any Linux-compatible
tape drives (SCSI or proprietary bus, since I don't have IDE in this
machine) that are pretty affordable (under $500) that are close to
1GB?

Thanks.
Pete.

Date: 22 Sep 94 15:49:22 GMT

Hi folks,

I have the following problem:
my current employer has an EISA-machine with an (for me) unknown
ethernet-card. It's a 
        Intel EtherExpress 32Bit ( NE3200 ) / EISA
I'm not sure this is the correct name, but i hope some guru on
the net will recognize it.

I looked through the kernel-sources (1.1.50), but couldn't find a
driver for this card (or is it the ac3200 in drivers/net?).

Does anybody know of this card, or is there already someone writing
the driver?

It's fairly important for us to get them working (the
destination-machine will have 3 of them).

Any information would be of great value ;-)

ciao

In theory using the kernel IPX support instead of the DOSemu packet driver
should have the desired effect too as each client will allocate a different
IPX socket number.

Actually, it is a bit of a "verschlimmbesserung" that the
distribution tend to carry the formatted man pages only.
Granted, you get faster lookup times, but you lose the ability
to pretty-print them with 'man -t'. For some of the larger
"pages", this can actually be the difference between readable
and not. The slackware contrib directory has a rather extensive
set of manual sources.

BTW: Can you have the *sources* in compressed form and still
have 'man' working?

Hrm, sounds like you don't have enough swap space set up.  I have 8 megs of 
ram and 20 megs of swap set up which seems to do okay.  You can see if this 
is a problem by typing "free" and seeing if all your memory and swap is consumed.

Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 17:31:51 GMT

Hi Folks,

        Is there a way to get Dosemu to see linux files whose names 
don't fit the DOS limitations?  In many cases, long names could be truncated 
unambiguously.  Where truncation would result in ambiguity,
the file name could be encoded in some way which would create a unique name
fitting the DOS limitations.  Is this already implemented in Dosemu and, if
so, how do I turn it on?

                                        Thanks in advance,

Well...

You can low level format an IDE drive, but you have to have the right
software.

It's no longer the $3500 it was when IDE first happened; I gather Disk

Shouldn't it be the other way around?  I always thought Ctrl-S locks

I've got two machines with disks greater than 1023 
Cylinders ... and ESDI and a SCSI.  The problem is
not with Linux recognizing the higher cylinders, but
in booting.

LILO won't install properly for me on my ESDI
machine with 1630 cylinders, since the Linux primary
partition has some cylinders > 1023.  But, I routinely
that machine from a floppy and it runs fine.

When I installed my SCSI machine, I created the 
primary Linux partition with all cylinders below
1024 cylinders.  I have created a secondary partition
for the rest of the disk and mounted it separately.

My SCSI controller (Ultrastor 34F) has a jumper 
that can be set to re-map the disk geometry and make
it appear to have half the cylinders.  I haven't tried
this feature, but a friend has, and said that it
didn't work with Linux.  I suspect that it is something
specific to Ultrastor/Linux.  Your mileage may vary.


Hope this helps,

We run amd on DEC OSF/1 to automount CD-ROM's very happily - I would
think it should work for floppies on Linux. If I get a chance I will try on
our linux amd setup.

here is the entry in the auto.mnt for a machine with a cdrom

                  host!=sappho;type:=nfs;rhost:=sappho

Unless you wait for the timeout period you have to do a amq -u before
removing the cd-rom.
