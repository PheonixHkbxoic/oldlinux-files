IT IS ALL MY FAULT - DON'T BLAME LINUX!

Confessions of Network Administator:

I did 3 things wrong that caused all my problems with PPP and IP Forwarding:

1. DNS/BIND mismatch between my primary server, and my providers server
        My Internet Provider runs a secondary name server for my domain, and I 
made changes to my primary DNS tables (including re-assigning the IP of my DOS 
box)... BUT I FORGOT TO CHANGE THE SERIAL NUMBER IN THE DNS TABLES. The serial 
number is how secondary servers determine that DNS needs to update... So the 
two servers had different IP addresses for the same host name... OOOPPPS!

2. DOS TCPIP Routing MisConfiguration
        Netmanage Chameleon has two separate configurations for routing... the 
Default Route, and a Routing Table... I had set up an entry in the routing 
table for my Net Provider that pointed to a router that was available on the 
old network that I was connected to.. and that entry over-rode the Default 
Route that pointed to the correct router (took me 4 days to find that one) 

3. Gratituously updating Linux versions 
        My initial response to this problem was to blame Linux 1.0 and to 
attempt to install a later rev of the system (1.1.49 to be exact). This 
ofcourse created all sorts of additional problems requiring the installation of 
updated applications and utilities, which I thouroughly botched in my haste to 
get the system working as a router.... Since I found the other problems, and 
did a complete re-install of 1.0.... everything has worked fine...

Advice to the Wannabe Network Administrator:

        Erasing and application and doing a clean install may not be a bad 
idea. All of the configuration may look right.. but some leftover trash may be 
spoiling your whole day.

Request to the Linux Developers:

        I had a *ell of a time figuring out what patches and utilities went 
together to make a fully updated version of the system... Grouping the Patch 
files with the utilities required to accomodate the update would really help.

        Other than that... KUDOS TO YOU ALL... Linux is the best system I've 
worked with since I started working with MicroPort and Venix 6 years ago.. It 
certainly beats even the latest release of UnixWare in terms of ease of 
installation and loads of applications and utilities right outa the box...

        Before I shoot myself in the foot again.....

The AC3200 driver is for the Ansel Communications EISA ethercard based on a
shared memory 8390.  

It's unrelated to the NE3200, which will probably never have a Linux driver.

Both are unrelated to the Intel EtherExpress32.  I don't have any
documentation on the EE32 (or an EISA machine to develop a driver on), but
Intel might release it if you ask them.

How to duplicate more boot floppy from one existing floppy?
I'm facing some serious trouble when installing linux on a Pentium
with 1G HD; linux is within the first 300meg, so I don't think the
1024 cylinder problem should affect me.  But the new installation
refused to boot ("partition table error"); the floppy created during
the installation refused to boot too.  The only thing got the system
going was a floppy from a previous installation on a 486.  Now since
that disk was reated only for backup purpose, I'd prefer to make a
seperate one for booting the Pentium box.  Any thoughts on how to
copy a floppy containing kernel image?

Thanks; please cc:jsun@mit.edu in your response

Hmm ... I'm not up on sizes for modem buffers (I was trapped in a hardware
design project for a long time and only recently surfaced for air. :) ),
but a 24x80 line screen is about 2k ... just how large a buffer are we talking
about, anyway? If it is on the order of kbytes, then there is another solution.
99 times out of a 100, a user is using either vt100/ansi emulation. I'm
not entirely sure, because this isn't really my field, but I believe there
is at least on vt100 code that will cause the user's terminal to respond 
with some sort of transmission [I think this is how automatic detection is
possible, correct me if that's wrong, please.]. You could send your banner,
immediately followed by such a code, and calculate the time elapsed between
when you began sending the banner and when you got the response. This would
give you a decent estimate of the lapsed time. 
 
This would have some drawbacks, namely a reduction in portability for 
applications that used terminals that didn't have such a code (and you
would definitely want to be checking the TERM environment variable to 
make sure the code you send is the correct one for the terminal), and the
fact that users of those terminal [emulators] wouldn't get estimates, 
but I think that anyone who's satisfied with a dumb terminal is probably
not going to complain much (if they even have download capability).

Hello,

I post for a friend who hasn't access to the net. He has a problem
with his root file system. He has checked it when it was mounted.
The next time he boots he got the error message that some inode
count is wrong. He forced the system to make a file system check
at boot time. The check succeeds, but the next time he boots the
error comes again.
What can he do ????

There is an rmail commandline which can be used in the /usr/lib/aliases file

It looks something like this (although this is incorrect somehow):

SCSI, but if there is an floppy-controlled (or proprietary controller)

You can make a mirror image copy of a floppy with the following commands:

<switch floppies>

Have anyone noticed syslogd loosing records when the system is loaded?
As far as I understand, this may happen when the socket buffers are filled,
syslogd has not been dispatched yet to clean them, and an applicaiton is
issuing more syslog()s.  As the syslog() function uses non-blocking write, the
message is just dropped if it cannot be written into the socket.

Is there any good way to avoid such loss of information?

        OS/2-3.0 isn't out yet either is it? :-)   The official release
        of XFree86-3.1 was supposed to be the end of Sept. so I would
        be patient just a little longer.

I've been trying to get a slip connection to my linux box from a windows 
client running tcpman 1.0a. 
I followed instructions in the HOWTO/NET-2-HOWTO/help/man/...

Almost everywhere they say to do a ifconfig., here is what I get when I 
do that:

#  /sbin/ifconfig ppp0 93.89.34.1 pointopoint 93.89.34.50
SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device or address


the same using sl0 or anything else.
Of course I selected SLIP/CSLIP/PPP when I recompiled my kernel 1.1.51.


Anybody has any idea and examples?

thanks,
andre
