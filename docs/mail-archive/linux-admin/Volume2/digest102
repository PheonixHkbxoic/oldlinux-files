The problem is that of the /dev directory, and I for one don't want a
script mucking with my carefully configured /dev directory, especially
not one which might delete devices just because I boot a minimal
kernel.

Admittedly, the 16-bit device space inherited from Minix is a major
problem.  It would be relatively easy to fix on the filesystem side,
but since dev_t is unsigned short it would mean a lot of programs
would have to be recompiled, or there would have to be a hideously
complicated compatibility library.  Maybe something for libc-5 when it
is a matter of upgrading binaries or keeping libc-4 around anyway.

However, the major problem here is that the person who had promised to
keep track of device number allocations disappeared off the face of
the Earth.  If it would help, I would volunteer to pick up the Device
Number Registrar's position and allocate device major numbers (and
possibly minor numbers as well for things like busmice).  I have the
resources to keep an updated list available for WWW and FTP, and even
run a mailing list if so is desirable.

OK, granted, it's a tad rude, but here's two responses to that:
1) Most modern terminal programs have zmodem, and most people use it. 
Zmodem's transfer resumption takes care of this problem. Still not a great
solution though, as you pointed out, so here's a better one:
2) record the time that the FIRST file transmission was begun. when the
first file is completely transferred (at the point where you are currently
checking the time limit) calculate the average throughput of the connection
and use that to estimate the estimated time for transmission of the rest of
the files. This could also be done by dumping (for instance) a 1000 
CR characters to the user's terminal, and calculating the average cps from
the time it takes for that. the more characters, obviously, the more reliable
the estimate, but the longer it takes to get the estimate. This can also
be readjusted after each file as per the above. 

An even better method would be to calculate the average throughput by
measuring the time it takes to transmit a system banner or motd (or
whatever). That way the user is getting useful text instead of a blinking
cursor..

Why don't you just modify Uniboard so that it spawns a daemon that does
the online-time checking concurrently with the sz/sb/sx process? People
go out and write things for Unix, and never take full advantage of the
fact that it's a completely multi-user, mutli-tasking OS.

Nate,
        I don't have the answers you're looking for but I would be
interested in answers to your questions as well.  In this area, you
might find the following helpful.  If anyone has better ideas, please advise.
 
        The slackware "installpkg" command has a "-warn" option that
will show you what would happen if you were to install a given package
on your existing system.
        I don't believe there is anything similar for disk sets as a whole;
you'll have to check each package individually and then try to figure out
how the installations affect things together by hand.

Well, since you are running Linux, just change your getty program

Get the source code for getty_ps and add this feature into it. Just
get it to dump the connect string into a file and have a separat
program deal with the time limit problem.

telnet provides telnet.

there is no menuing as such, they axre all command-line driven.

All these UNIX utilities are designed to be run from the command line.  
The menuing systems you might be familiar with are all front ends that

my board, they work fine if I download over the modem from another UNIX

doesn't even start correctly.  The filename is in 8.3 format.  What are 
the command line parameters I need to give on the Linux side?

True.  But you'll note I didn't say anything about where those 2 addresses
need to reside.  Common sense would seem to suggest putting your
"router's" PPP port on your host's net, and it's ether on your own, and in
fact, this works.  At worst, external incoming connections will get aimed
at your ether IP number, but you don'e lost a _whole_ there...

Said friend, but I don't know whether he was really serious.  There is
going to be a problem, too, with OS/2 3.0.  As anyone who's already

filesystem does not work with Warp's HPFS.

Those are the extended attributes (in other words, your settings
noterbook for the file).  I think they're stored in an odd way on DOS
FAT filesystems, which is where you see this error.  However, I seem
to remember seeing somewhere an announcement of a msdos fs update that
fixed this.  Am I making this up, someone?

Sorry I can't really help, but I think it would be best to wait for
Warp's official release next month before anyone really commits
themselves to such a project.

Subject: Max MTU=1500? But NFS/Amd rsize=wsize=8192?
Date: 24 Sep 1994 20:00:13 GMT

Hi all,

We have several Linux boxes running Linux 1.1.18, which use our Sun
SPARCstations as the NIS/NFS servers.

We were trying to change the NFS packet read/write size to 8192 bytes 
(as SunOS does). We read the fine Linux Network Admin book and it seems 
to us that the UDP packet size is limited to 3500 bytes and hence the NFS 
read/write size is limited to 3500 bytes. Also we were trying to increase
the read/write size in the automounter to 8192 bytes too. Even if we 
change it, will it work?

Moreover, when we do a `netstat -i' the MTU is by default 1500 bytes. If
the size is only 1500 bytes, how can NFS/Automounter can communicate with
8192 bytes? Is it possible that with kernel 1.1.18 we can increase the
MTU size to 8192 with `ifconfig' or it doesn't matter because NFS will 
overwrite the default MTU size?

We are wondering if there are any public domain packages that allow us to
monitor the packet size when our Linux boxes are communicating with the
Sun servers? Anyone has any experience?

Any help is highly appreciated.
