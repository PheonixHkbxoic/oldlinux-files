Hi,  does your computer get as far as resolving a hostname into an IP
address?  If not, try telnet with an IP address instead of a name and
see if that works (you can find out the IP address from another
(working!) computer)... if that does, chances are is that computer is
having problems resolving names, probably due to an incorrect
configuration in /etc/host.conf or /etc/resolv.conf.  If you thinks
thats the problem, the these files should read something like this:

/etc/host.conf:

order hosts, bind
multi on

/etc/resolv.conf:

domain demon.co.uk
nameserver 127.0.0.1

(substitute your domain for 'demon.co.uk' and the IP address for your
nameserver in place of '127.0.0.1')

Peace, Ben

: change the 1m for the respective back and fore ANSI colors.

You can get a list of the color codes in /etc/DIR_COLORS, here's an
extract:

# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init
# string consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
# Attribute codes: 
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
NORMAL 00       # global default, although everything should be something.
FILE 00         # normal file
DIR 01;34       # directory
LINK 01;36      # symbolic link
FIFO 40;33      # pipe

You need to use the escape sequence ^[[ in front of the numbers, and
the suffix 'm'.  You can get '^[' from the command line by pressing
control-v and then escape, or from emacs by pressing control-Q then
escape.

E.G.  to echo something in blue (the color used for directories by ls)

echo '^[[01;36mBlue^[[00m'

Peace,  Ben

    Hi folks
I am working on graphics application using srgp and sphigs in my 
Ambra EVL/66 DX2. My interaction with Linux and its friend thus far had 
been smooth until I used srgp and sphigs to write programs for my graphics 
class. I compiled the libraries and put the libsrgp.a and libsphig.a in the 
approprate dir's, and it complies with out problem, when I tried to 
execute them I get the message "Segementation Fault" would someone 
kind enough to shade light what it means. 
   Does any body knows that the libphigs.a in /usr/X11/lib is the 
actual phigs or is it phigs plus standard library, and further more 
would some one knows if there are special linux specific compiled of 
srgp and sphigs library.

Subject: swapfile: mkswap swapon
Date: 30 Sep 1994 10:16:03 GMT

When I notice my Linux (several user, 16Mb) running low on swapspace
I frequently create some additional swapfile (if there is some disk space)
and attach it:

dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=4
mkswap /swapfile 4096
swapon /swapfile

However, frequently the system did not accept the newly created swapfile.
The reason is, that writing the swap signature to the swapfile ends up 
in the Linux buffer pool, whereas the swapon system-call bmap's the file
directly from disk. The solution is quite easy:

sync after mkswap!

Perhaps this call should be implemented directly in the mkswap command.

Date: 30 Sep 1994 11:36:35 GMT

I just got a slackware Linux 2.0 and installed on my machine.
Somehow, I messed up and Bootdisk does not start Linux.

In my lilo.conf, I only have DOS section because I want to start
Linux only from Boot-Floppy.

Also, how can I make changes for my Mitsumi CD-ROM working?
My base address for Mitusumi is 0x340 and irq 11, but Linux setup is
base address 0x300 and irq 11.

Can anybody give me good example of 'lilo.conf' file?

I installed only Toolkit for Linux part 1 which is one of two CDs.
Do I have to install the second CD-ROM in order to use X-Windows?

Thank you for your helps,
Jason

OK. After several mails indicating that smail does not have that
problem, I looked more closely. The culprit is in the OS configuration.
The hole doesn't show iff you 'HAVE=...SETEUID...' set in conf/os/linux -
smail then uses seteuid() to play with userids, and neither needs
nor uses check_path.
If you compile without SETEUID, check_path is neccessary.

I just recompiled my smail with SETEUID and can now safely omit check_path.
It doesn't hurt to have it in there, so it is still a good idea to
put check_path in the file transport configuration.

Sorry for any confusion this might have caused, but the problem seems
to exist in some distributions, so I think it is important.

Hello everyone,

I cannot make the two ones mentioned in the header work together. ZyXEL has
ROM 6.12, kernel is 1.1.51, dip is dated 5.9.94. Script's start is as follows:

*************
  get $local walhalla

  netmask 255.255.255.0

  port ttyS1
  speed 38400
  print Now connecting $local ($locip) towards $remote ($rmtip)...

  # Reset the modem and terminal line.
  # This seems to cause trouble for some people!
  reset

  # Prepare for dialing.
  send ATQ0V1E1X4T&N17\r
  wait OK 2
  if $errlvl != 0 goto modem_trouble_1
  dial 1613075
  if $errlvl != 0 goto modem_trouble_2
  wait CONNECT 60
  if $errlvl != 0 goto modem_trouble_3

  # We are connected.  Login to the system.
*************

It breaks directly after dialing (and goes to modem_trouble_2). An older
script (and dip-3.3.7) make the connection with the very same modem without
any problems, and I do not know where to search for the error.

Can anyone help?

   I want to transfer a binary file between Sun5.3 and Linux.
   Generally, I use "tar" to transfer file, but it seems that "tar M" 
   does not work on the Sun's tar. The file is larger than 1.44MB.
   What can I do?

Although "split" is line oriented, and designed for text files, you
can usually play around with the parameters to get reasonable size
chunks. Then stick each chunk on a floppy, then "cat" them together at
the other end.

Or you can write a binary split. It's pretty short, so here's one
someone else did earlier...

=======================================================================

This is a little C program to split files by size in bytes, rather than
by lines like the default Unix split. I use it to split large archives
to take home to unpack on the amiga by putting them on PeeCee format
disks. If anyone out there has a method of reading a multi-volume tar
archive off of disks with a PeeCee sector format let me know!

The program is supplied as source and should compile with any ANSI
standard C compiler (if you have gcc on your system just type "make").
Once you have compiled it, the command syntax is, e.g.:

    bsplit GNUEmacs18-58.lha emacs.l 720000

Will produce files emacs.laa, emacs.lab, etc. of length suitable to
fit one of each on a PeeCee DS/DD 3.5" floppy. They can then be read
into your Amiga with MessyDOS or whatever and reassembled with:

    join emacs.laa emacs.lab ... as GNUEmacs18-58.lha

or, if you have reed them in sequence:

    join emacs.l?? as ....


I realise this is not an amazing piece of code but we're not all 
programmers out there :-)

I'm trying to get the newest kernel to compile (think it is 1.1.51)
To work with I have : linux-1.1.45.tar.gz
                      patch46..51

To patch the kernel I'm doing the following:
1) remove link to current kernel src
2) pwd=/usr/src
3) tar -xzf linux-1.1.45.tar.gz
4) patch < patch46
5) strain eyes at text flashing by @ 1000 mph (everything seems to say 
     ........ succeeded)
6) patch < patch47 ......... etc

Now the problem:

after certain patches new files (and their .orig) are left in /usr/src namely:
 
 ncp.h 

after patch47

 ni52.c
 ni52.h
 ni65.c
 ni65.h
 entry.S

after patch48

 blkdev.h

after patch49

Where should these files go, or am I ddoing something wrong?

Thnx

It is possible to change your video mode via lilo.
 
Set the video mode to ASK.

Then press return when you reboot.  You will be presented with a list of
modes available on your card.  

You can set this permanently by using the number of the mode you use instead
of ASK in you lilo.conf. 

I occasionally use 132x66 mode when Im using irc of tin - makes for better
usage of the screen.  Im not sure if there is a way of changing this when
you have already started.  

Perhaps someone else can provide an answer.
