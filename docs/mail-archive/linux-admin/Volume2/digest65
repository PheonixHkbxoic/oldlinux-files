Subject: Sound Blaster Is Installed, but I get driver errors.
Date: 14 Sep 1994 17:19:20 -0500

Okay, I have Linux 1.0.9 and Windows installed on my machine.  The cdrom
and sound card both work under windows.  I recompiled the kernel and added
the cdrom and sound drivers for Linux, and the cdrom began working.  Hurray!
However, the sound card remains quiet.  I did create the device files, but
still nothing.  Also, I haven't noticed any messages during the boot 
process that mention the sound driver initializing.  I don't know if it should
produce messages or not.

Here is the output of 'cat /dev/sndstat':

Sound Driver:2.4 (Wed Sep 14 00:23:04 CDT 1994 root@farside.neosoft.com)
Config options: 1ae2

HW config:

(Type 1: AdLib at 0x388 irq 0 drq 0)

PCM devices:

Synth devices:

Midi devices:

No mixers installed

I loaded a few sound applications such as 'aumix'.  The aumix application
produces the following output:

SOUND_MIXER_READ_DEVMASK: No such device or address

I have checked the source code and it is trying to open the correct file,
and it exists with 666 permissions.  The error is actually produced by
an ioctl statement (or something like that).

Any advise?  Thanks, Jerry

Hi all !

I would be interested in replies to this question, being that I had to
give up approx 35 MB of my 545 MB drive, due to non standard translations
done by my IDE accellerator, when heads go over 1024. ( I was time
limited when transferring my linux files off of my 345 ) I have since
learned I can work around this with the new kernel I have, (1.1.45) since
it queries the drive directly.

I had almost everything on a 105 MB partition for a few months, till I
replaced my second drive. I found that when I gave it 200 + 16 swap,
I had lots to spare *but* it's quickly filling up, as I'm adding new
stuff to it. (wine, dosemu, TeX). I think it depends on how you want
to use it. The stuff available for linux seems endless.

Yggdrassil has a plug'n'play cd and slackware has a cd version also,
where I hear you can run some of the less frequently used binaries
from, ( also hear it's slower ).

I'd say you can more than get away with 200 MB (a least for a few
months)

Hope this helps.

basically, you need no "BBS Software" for a Linux machine.  just setup
the users like yourself, turn on the modem and away you go.

well, er, there are a few other things (of course), but thats about it.

>modify it to eliminate shell escapes and other security hazards.

instead of worrying about the prospect of those irritating users
getting access to the shell, why not just up and *give* it to them
and concern yourself with other aspects of security.

there are benefits to this approach.

a) it is *much* easier.
b) the users will appreciate it (eventually ... there will be whiners)
c) you can concentrate instead on writing documentation and instruction
   files for your users.
d) it throws the security problem into the area of general unix security,
   and there are piles of books on this to educate you.  *** THIS IS VITAL
   EVEN IF YOU DECIDE TO RESTRICT SHELL ACCESS ***
e) system administration becomes identical to that on a standard unix
   machine ... again, there are many books to help you here as well.
f) it is completely consistent with the flavour and operating style of a
   UNIX machine.  as the Borg say:  resistance is futile.

virtually all commercial internet providers will give you a shell if
you ask.  they are not terribly concerned about "security", beyond what
steps they have taken at a lower level (see (d), above).

Heck, the one I use even lets me (shock! dismay!) *compile code*.

why re-invent the wheel?

a) use the "gopher" program directly for gopher
b) use a standard news reader for reading news
c) use a standard mail reader for reading mail

documentation exists for all these programs. and all of them are
actually easier to use and *much* more flexible than their MS-DOS
counterparts.

>login time

yes, this is a stickler for most Linux machines as they come out of the
box.  however, it is very easy to write a C program to punt idle
users, and over-limit sessions, off the line.  mine is 155 lines long.

you will probably need a disk-space quota thing as well ... but most Linux
machines come with such.  you will have to learn how to enable it.

what i've heard, is that the average BBS user has a brain.  and he/she can
usually read as well.  rather than writing bizarre shell scripts filled with
"ACCESS DENIED", "INTRUDER ALERT", "GUARDS! GUARDS!" and "ARREST THAT USER!"
messages (:-/), why not just sit down and document and point the new users
to places where they can learn?

there is *big* interest in things UNIX by alot of MS-DOS users out there.
i suspect your users will rise to the "challenge", except for the chronic
and terminal whiners (but you know who they are by now).  for those, run
the old MSDOS BBS program inside a DOSemu session.  they deserve it. :)

>UUCP.  [detroit area]

there is probably a "detroit.general" newsgroup (or something similar).
just post a message there asking for a UUCP link ... it's a start.
UUCP links are fairly easy to negotiate.  for mine, I asked a guy "Can I
have a UUCP feed?" and he said "Ok".

>I have a lot of questions and if you've read up to the end of this

well, considering my tone, you probably don't appreciate it.  ["miserable
running-dog Linux elitist scum!" you are probably muttering :-]  alot of the
above looks like I am sneering at *you* in particular, but thats not the
case.  i am laughing at the idea of a "BBS Program" for Linux, and am somewhat
concerned at the prospect of an MSDOS front end (and all that it implies)
on a Linux machine.  for Linux offers you and your users a real escape from
the basic limitations of the MS-DOS remote-access model.

On my machine (8 Meg Ram, 128K cache, 486DX2-66, with a LocalBus S3 805

coredump.  In fact, the linux version doesn't exhibit a bug the dos 1.6 beta

just that any slowdown isn't readily perceptible to me, and doesn't detract

I lost the last two days to DOOM, now I see what all the fuss is about

Does anyone have an Xconfig for 320x200 mode? :-)

I have installed Linux v1.0 Slackware release for 24hr SLIP access
into ClarkNet and SMTP for my Novell 3.11 LAN.  Everything works 
great except some mail that is sent out through SMTP causes a 
uucp_neighbors error.  I know there is a missing file called
/usr/lib/smail/routers that will correct this with the right config 
in it.  The error is :

Xdefer: <address> reason: <ERR_127> router uucp_neighbors :
command '/usr/bin/uuname' returned exit status EX_32256

I know calling uuname is a bug in SMAIL and a routers file will fix
this but I don't know wht to put in it.

What do I need to put in /usr/lib/smail/routers to get these messages
delivered?  Thanks for the help.

Date: 14 Sep 1994 14:19:13 GMT

Hi,

Every 4th or 5th logout from an X session, the video
card seems to lock up my entire system.

I get a black screen with vertical color lines.

The video is a #9 GXE 1MB (level 11 then?) connected
to a 15" NEC 4fge multisync. I run at 1024*768.

I tried:
        new X
        new Xconfig
        new Xview
        dumping Xview, going to FVWM
        using xdm, still switches hardware modes (???), need
                dosemu on console (xdos problem, next post!)

The stability of this system is important since it controls my
LAN and is NFSed to to other machines. Currently we're
using a policy of "IF YOU LOGOUT FROM X, inform others", which
is a terrible waste of an otherwise great video card.

Any suggestions welcome,

I have tried three different versions of xfig (the version distributed

the same problem.

After I start xfig, it starts to devour memory.  After about three
minutes everything locks up.  I can usually kill the process, but it
takes about a minute to type in 'kill -9 444'.

I can compile the same versions of xfig under Ultrix and everything
works fine.   BTW, I have seen this problem of two diferent machines.
I know other people are running xfig under Linux, so what am I doing
wrong?

        The security problems with fingerd are a bit removed from immediacy.
It's still a problem.  Some of the bugs may have been removed, but you can
still do stalker-like things on any system running fingerd.  Your
implication -- that the protective attitude employed by many system
administrators is archaic -- doesn't do justice to the actual, continuing

        The performance problems that finger creates and/or allows are just
another good reason to waste the little pain in the neck.

First of all you should configure your modem that it returns
the DTE speed not the DCE speed in the CONNECT <speed> string.

Than you should enable hardware flow control for the modem and
the serial line. 

Than you can lock the modem at 38400. So the modem is using
the handshake lines to prevent overruns.

I don't understand. I have an old 1Mb ISA Orchid et4000 on a
