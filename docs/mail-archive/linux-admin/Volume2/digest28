Thanks, all together
here is summary of what cured the problem.

There are two things which helped me

1) The external cable wasn't connected properly :-(
2) I had to boot up with a tape inserted.

After I straightened the cable  out a bit and reconnected it, it works
sometimes but when I have a tape inserted yt boot up it works like a charme.
But I really don't know why it needs the tape

By the way, when it is driven by the sun you can boot up without a tape!

Thanks again, Achim

Subject: Re: WARNING about shadow-mk package
Date: 6 Sep 1994 02:10:30 -0500


=====BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE=====

This post is in regards to the login.secure program included in
the shadow-mk package authored by Mohan Kokal.  I, Joseph R.M. Zbiciak,
am the sole author of this program, and would like to dispell any
rumors labeling it as the tool of a "cracker." 

Included in this post is the source code for my /bin/login replacement.

The binary included in the shadow-mk package distributed by Mohan Kokal
was apparently compiled under GCC 2.4.5, using libc 4.4.4.  I base this
statement on the fact that the binary was indeed compiled by me on my
personal Linux box, "asylum," prior to June 9th.  On June 9th, I upgraded
to GCC 2.5.8, and libc 4.5.26.


Inspection of the login.secure binary will reveal that it was indeed
linked with libc 4.4.4.  

Therefore, I seek corroboration of the following, since I cannot
do this myself (my system has no room to dl libc 4.4.4 and gcc 2.4.5 to
try this):

The login.secure binary was most probably compiled as follows:

gcc -o login.secure -s -N -O6 -fomit-frame-pointer -m386 login1.c

(as I said, under GCC 2.4.5, and libc 4.4.4)


Using GCC 2.5.8 and libc 4.5.26 yeilds an executable of 1328 bytes
with these options.  

Let me remind you that the /bin/login on my system has been and continues 
to be the login.secure binary that was included in shadow-mk.  (Size:
1124 bytes.  CRC: a4abbb26)


I have PGP-signed this post to ensure its authenticity.  My public key
is available via finger.  Please finger im14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu.
Pipe the output to a file and run pgp -ka on the file to add the key
to your keyring.  This key is primarily for private messages.  I do not
yet have a well established key for business use.  One will be forthcoming.

Please:  I urge *ANYONE* that has any questions, problems, etc. relating
this program to CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.  My email address is, once again,
im14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu.  Should that address fail, there's also
im14u2c@camelot.bradley.edu.  Should both of those addresses fail for one
reason or another, email Mohan Kokal at magnus@cegt201.bradley.edu, with
instructions to forward the mail to me.

And again:  I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused
anyone.  The shadow-mk package is not insecure.  The login.secure is
indeed what it was titled.  I do hope that this post lays to rest any
suspicion about the shadow-mk package, its contents, and its author.
I also apologize to Mohan Kokal for not realizing that such a small piece
of code would cause such a large number of people to label him as a
cheap-and-dirty cracker.

This reminds me, I am curious as to how many users my machine can 
support. I am going to be putting my Linux box on the net soon and would 
like to know how many users I can expect before the system becomes too 
bogged down. I currently have a 486/66 with 8 meg of ram and an 8 meg 
swap. I plan on upgrading the ram to 12 pretty soon. I usually run X on 
the local console. Any estimates on how many users I should be able to 
support? I have plans to make several services available on my machine, 
but what I can do depends on the number of users I can have at once.

Well, the HOW-TO applying here is the
HOW-TO-get-informations-for-bloody-beginners. Oops, does not seem to have
been written yet. The advice can be described as RTFM.

Let's quote from it nevertheless:
The usual source of help available for using a specific command is the
so-called man-page. You can get this with the man command. For the usage
of the man command, try
man man
For the usage of bash, try
man bash
You might also consider using info in emacs. Type ^H (this is control-H) I
and then look for the fitting node, if you have installed info pages.

At least with bash, man bash should do the trick:
.bashrc is read by all interactive shells *except* login shells.
Setting up PATH and other things which get exported anyway is best
done not in .bashrc, but in .profile (or .bash_profile). In fact,
I have yet to find a good use for .bashrc. In case I'll find one,
my .profile contains
if [ -r ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi

Subject: UID 0 Passwd blues
Date: 6 Sep 1994 09:14:15 GMT

I ran accross an inconvenient ``feature'' of the passwd program yesterday.
On one of our Linux boxes we have 3 UID 0 users --- root and two others. 
Since initial setup a week ago, everything was working fine, but suddenly
the root password was invalid :-( After some investigation and experimenting
we found that one of the users had changed his password and that this changes
all the  UID 0 passwords to the same thing.

Is this supposed to be so? I think not. What is the easiest way to fix it?
(I'm using Slackware 2.0 distribution)

Thanx

Well said!  This is supposed to be a community, isn't it?  Part of
the reason that I'm getting involved in Linux is because I miss the

We helped the newbies out patiently, and often as not, they went on to

Yes, the latest version, (lynx 2.3) is on sunsite at pub/Linux/system

I did exactly that, patched by hand. I put the .21 QUOTA kdiffs into a 47
kernel. The patchs 47->48 and 48->49 went in with no problem. The first
step's a biggie though :) I can't say about ACCT 'cos I don't bother with
process paranoia ;)

I agree that they should get into the real kernel soon. I've been using
QUOTA for weeks now and it works beautifully.

Setting the passwords in turn, saving the passwd file to different
names each time, then pasting together with a text editor.

OR: giving those other users other ids, setting their passwords, then changing
the ids back to 0. Sounds great, doesn't it?

But at least it works.
Downside to this: anybody knowing any password of any user 0 can change the
superuser one, if he is able to get a shell (usually this will not quite work).

: For Linux, you have to pass the "single" argument to the kernel.

: At the LILO prompt, just type "linux single" (if your image's name is 
: "linux").

I had the same problem yesterday, booted into single user mode 
and it didn't help a bit :-( If I tried any change, the system said the drive
was read only, although mount reported it as (rw). I tried playing arround with
remounting /dev/hda1 (my boot drive) to no avail.

Finally I rebooted the computer with the slackware boot/root combination, 
mounted /dev/hda1 and fixed it this way.

I'm currently using the 1.1.18 kernel straight from the Slackware 2.0 q 
series. 

Is this normal behavior? How do you get _real_ (rw) after booting single user?

Subject: 525MB streamer that wouldn't backup 300MB: SOLVED!
Date: Tue, 6 Sep 1994 09:29:58 GMT

Hi all!

First of all, thanks to all of you who replied to my initial post! I received
many suggestions, backup scripts etc. I tried many of the solutions you suggested,
but none seemed to solve my problem. Fiddling around with cpio's parameters
I tried different block-sizes, IO-sizes (-C param)... whether my streamer was
in streaming mode (almost) all the time or started-stopped pretty often didn't
make any difference.

I got NovaStor under MSDOG, and it didn't do any better either. Its main virtue
has been to tell precisely how much data I got on a single tape: about 160MB...
That sort of gave the game away: the tapes I had were labelled "DC6525", but were
in fact DC6150's... I got myself another tape, a 3M DC6525 and lo and behold: 523MB
on a single tape...

Once again, thanks to all of you who helped. The lesson seems to be that not every
DC6525 is in fact a DC6525 ;-)

Regards,

Eelco.
