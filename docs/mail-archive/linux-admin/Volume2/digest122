GNU tar allows for block size setting with the "b" option. No need to

Hate to belabor the obvious but make sure your MTUs match.  Also,
when you do your PING experiment, don't ping the cisco box on
the IP address associated with the net/subnet you are pinging
from.  There are some rules related to same net/different net
maximum packet sizes which might be confusing your experiment.
(I'm perhaps incorrectly assuming the cisco box has multiple
IP addresses/nets).

Can you show the problem with a 'commercial' TCP/IP product?
More likely to interest cisco as their problem in that case.

I've done it, edit the makefile to change the -D for system to the
value which matches linux ... it was obvious when I looked but my
source is at work.  Compiled binaries are available at sunsite from
what I've heard ...  you'll have to look yourself (sunsite.unc.edu).
 
There is a command line flag for the daemon which overrides the .h file
location for configuration data.  The source tar from ncsa includes
html pages for documentation (as I recall ... or maybe I got them
separately?) and does include sample config files, mostly with many
comments.  Took an hour or two to bring up the server.  I already
had a home page.

You are waiting a few seconds for the fingerd daemon to update itself,

I'm using a WangDAT 3400DX (4GB uncompressed, 8GB compressed on 120M tapes).
It also can use 60M and 90M tapes, with lesser capacity.  It works great.
I ordered it from insight/hdi (computer shopper).  It came with scsi controller,cables, docs, etc for about $1500 (with no case).  I'm using it with a
BusLogic 445s VLB controller (not the ISA one that came with it).  I also
have two 1.7GB Micropolis drives.  With the newer kernels supporting the
buslogic cards, everything works great.  It very fast and reliable.  I'm
in the process of setting up cron jobs and scripts to automatically backup
the Linux box, three Nextstep PCs, and a sparc.  I've already got it to
work with NeXTstep, albeit with less than optimal settings, need to work on
the blocking factor, etc.

Any good SCSI2 DAT drive should work with Linux.  I'm not sure on how
well (if at all) you can control the compression with the drivers.  Under
Solaris, I can turn compression on/off, buy using different drivers, but
you will want to consider getting a DAT that you can jumper to default to
either (until) in case linux doesn't support it.

I may be alble to hel pwith minicom.  I had a similar problem until i 
went into the configuration screen for file transfer. Thsi msut be done 
as root.  The eaiest way i is to  go root and then start minicom with the 
configure option (it may be -c, you can double check with the man page to 
make sure...)

Once in config mode, go to the file transfer config menu and remove the 
flags from sz and rz (and/or any other prtocol you use.)

In my version fo minicom at least, it comes configured for different 
versions of these transfer protocol programs then came with my Linux 
distribution.

Hope that helps!

Subject: BUG: Linux <--> Cisco
Date: 28 Sep 1994 17:45:35 GMT


  I have the following problem,

A telnet session, or any tcp session like uucico or rlogin, from a 
cisco 2500 router (it happens with other cisco devices too) is 
hanging when sending large packets to linux pcs. I have thrown 
out the 3com etherlink iii cards and replaced them with ne2000, 
replaced the pcs, replaced the cabling, tried all sorts of kernels 
from 1.0.9 to 1.1.50.

Steps to reproduce:
1)Telnet to a cisco
2)Telnet to a linux pc (from the cisco)
3)login and run a "ps aux" or anthing that produces *fast* text output
4)if it locks (and it probably will if you repeat the process often enough) 
  Hit CTRL-6 and then X (Cisco's esc sequence??) When you hit return to 
  resume your session, the rest ouf your output will be displayed.

Same occours when doing a telnet to port NNTP or UUCP.

16k pings from 3 machines to the Cisco produces 0 packet loss, same
in the other direction. Increasing the number of pinging machines
still gives 0 packet loss until ethernet collisions start to occur.

I get the feeling that there is a timing/flow control problem with TCP,
cisco has not been able to reproduce these effects (on sunstations however)

I talked to a guy in the us via IRC today, who has similar cisco 
equipment, and is experiencing the same problems.

The hardware I have used is (in all combinations)
486-dx2/66 486dx4/100 
ne2000 3com509
adaptec 1542cf

                     if anybody has any great ideas,

Hi, Mark,

see the /etc/DIR_COLORS...

        .
        .
        .
# Configuration file for the color ls utility 
# COLOR needs one of these arguments: 'tty' colorizes output to ttys, but not
# pipes. 'all' adds color characters to all output. 'none' shuts colorization
# off.
        .
        .
        .

...and use 'COLOR all'. So you can see color output at all.
