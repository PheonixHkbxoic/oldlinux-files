I have uploaded a file called "nfs3.ps" into ftp.funet.fi:~Linus/net-source.
It contains the specs for NFS version 3. Linux and all (?) other operating
systems (I just know Linux...) still use version 2 of NFS.

That file contains also a description of the locking functions. More specific:
It contains all changes from the old to this newer protocol...
But at the end of the file is a list of some good other books. One is said
to be written about an example implementaion of NFS version 2 together with
all thjose file locking things...

This subject came up some time ago on one of the Linux mailing lists.
Two persons have contacted me about further details. One wanted to write
those file locking functions for Linux and one needed the information for
some other (commercial?) stuff...

These usually work for me, though it's probably easier to use 
xvmixer.
Some of these commands may or may not be necessary depending on
the default status of your mixer...

mixer -rec line
mixer line 0
mixer +rec mic
mixer rec 75
mixer pcm 0
mixer synth 0
mixer cd 0
mixer mix 75
mixer pcm2 0

srec -S -s44 -b16 -t10 test

The above srec command will sample 44Khz stereo 16bit, for 10 seconds
and store the data in "test". The t option is not necessary, you can
just use control-c to stop recording.

Playback can be accomplished with splay (the same binary as srec,
just copied to splay, or vice-versa, I can't remember which)

splay -S -s44 -b16 test

I use an external analog mixer and have the pas connected in the tape2
loop of my stereo.  Beware of Feedback! (don't set your line volume
too high, it should be off when playing back pcm sounds...)

I used to have lots of weird sounds (from sunsite....)
play from my rc.local.  I got tired of the same sounds over and 
over.  It would be cool if someone made an audio "fortune" which 
played a random sound on login.... pretty simple really...

I've installed XFree86 3.1 just ten days ago to my Linux (1.1.53)
machine.
Now I've fighted with this problem for nine days and I'm getting tired.

Every normal shell program I'm trying to run under xterm (jove, less,
joe,
tin, elm, just name it and it won't work) just goes into background
automagically and says:

[1]+  Stopped (tty output)      jove

... and that's it, I've tried to change termcap other related
configuration files without success. I can see that in xterm window
my tty-setting aren't really what they should be (normally console
has -ignbrk and brkint, but xterm has ignbrk and -brkint so this
may be problem), so I tried to run 'stty sane' - result: I've got
'stty sane' as background process.

Thanks for your time.

Well, this also happened to me one time. I noticed however, that you

Date: Mon, 17 Oct 1994 22:23:33 GMT

I'm having trouble getting nenscript 1.13++ (from sunsite) to work
as an input filter with lpr.  I have two printers in printcap:
        lp - a serial-connected laser printer with if=/usr/bin/nenscript -p-
        PostScript - an unfiltered connection to the same laser printer.

The following cases work:
        nenscript README
        cat README | nenscript
        cat README | nenscript -

The following cases print blank pages
        lpr README
        lpr -Plp README
        cat README | nenscript -p- | lpr -PPostScritp

When the ouput files from 'nenscript README' and 'lpr README' are diff'ed,
there is no difference (except the title and header time).

It seems like some kind of problem with Linux pipes.  I'm running 1.1.49.

                                        Thanks,

The patch sets a times just before close(0) and if the system does not return 
from close(0) the timer will execute an exit(1). It works well, and happens 
about 25% of the time.

But it does happen... all the time.

Kernel 1.1.52, just trying to get 1.1.54 to work, which has a bunch of TCP bug 
fixes in it, but I cannot compile it because a file is missing in the patch.  
Argh!

I use sliplogin 1.2, with the patch. Sliplogin 1.3 has the patch now build-in 
on my request. (plus dynamic IP allocation!)

Subject: Advices needed for debugging linux lockup
Date: 18 Oct 1994 00:48:45 GMT


Our linux boxes have been frozen for a number
of times.  The problem gets to the point
where our trust in the serious use of Linux
is shaken.  I have xclock running, and whenever
the machine seems to be slow, I look up the
clock and pray: "please, please don't freeze
again".

Our system is Dell DX2-66 PCI, with on board video
system (ATI Mach32) and 3com509. 16MB RAM.  The machine
is connected to a hub by twisted pairs, in an environment
of a local Novel network (about 6 DOS boxes).

It seems that lock up occurs in the following conditions:
1. mail arrives (we run sendmail -bd -q 15m)
2. ftp sessions
3. remote X-windowing.
It was also suggested that running X-window may contribute
to the lockup.

We started at linux 1.1.47 and 1.1.52.  After sluggish 
network response (plus lockup), we backed to 1.0.8. 
We suspect network problems, in particular caused by those 
Novel networked PC's.  Is there a way for one to debug
the lock up problem?

If you cannot help directly, could you please give some
pointers as to where to turn to get help?

Thanks

I'm sorry but you won't get a X11R6 Mosaic in the next few weeks. From other

likely to be a genuine X11R6 implementation.

What about the other Motif-sellers (Swim)? Didn' read anything, it seems

Hi,

I'm trying to set up my supervisor's machine for printing and I'm having
problems with the parallel port.

At first, the kernel didn't even have the support added in but I thought
rebuilding would be the answer (inside every big problem, there are hundreds
of little ones waiting to get out...). Anyway, now the kernel boots and
(correctly) recognises lp1 but when I try to cat to it the machine just sits
there like the attached device is missing.. Sick thing is, I performed this
operation on another Linux machine we have earlier on today and I had no
problems at all.

Anyway, if anyone has experience with this kind of problem, I'd really
appreciate an e-mail 'cos this has to be done in the morning..

Machine is running a 1.0.8 kernel and also has a cdrom and tape drive
attached (incase this might be some kind of iospace error)..

Thanks in advance,
