Subject: Two Hostnames: Possible?
Date: 12 Sep 1994 15:17:42 GMT

Hi World!

Since a week, I have a SLIP-connection to the Internet. :)
Until then, I used to have lupo as my hostname. Together with my SLIP
account, I got an 'official' address (slip65.home.uni-freiburg.de)
Now the problem is receiving mail: 
I tried to convince smail to accept both names, i.e. lupo locally and
slip65 for external connections. But smail refuses until I completely
change the hostname to slip65. But, as I dislike the new name (yes, I
know, it's cosmetic....):
Is it possible to have different names for a computer? How to setup
smail (reading the NAG didn't give me the necessary clues)
Thanks in advance,

  Peter

Subject: Slow curses - is there a better/faster curses?
Date: 12 Sep 1994 00:51:27 -0700

48 hours ago I installed Slackware 2.0 and it was just about the easiest 
install I've ever done in 10 years of mucking around with computers.
Color me impressed.

We are using Linux on a box for people to do remote development - we
want to compile and run apps on the Linux box.  Exciting things like
accounting and other business tasks.

elvis is a pretty faithful implementation of vi although it's noticeably
slower in screen I/O than vi on a SPARC.  And that's when I'm only the
user on the linux box and there's nothing else happening on it.  And
with relatively small - 400-line - programs.

Console output under Linux was very quick and I'm sure X performance is
pretty good.  But curses performance is a little sluggish and adding
lines near the bottom of the screen is a real killer - curses seems to
clear the screen with blank lines <then> adds the new text.

I know that curses and terminals are going the way of the dinosaur but
like the dinosaur they're going to take a long time to die.  We were
looking at what it would cost to outfit our very small office with a
PC/Mac/Unix solution that ran under Windows, MacOS, and UNIX and decided
we could live with a curses interface.

But it would be nice if it were a little quicker.  Is there a
replacement curses out there somewhere?  I checked the FAQs, How-Tos,
and Meta-FAQ and didn't see a word about curses.

Thanks!

I have installed Slackware 2.0 and there was anonymous ftp setted.
Everything was okay, except for message displaying.
In /etc/ftpaccess, there was message command as following...

message /var/spool/ftpd/msgs/welcome.msg  login

but no message was displayed on ftp loggin on.
I tryed another message command like

message .message cwd=*

to display .message in each directory, but nothing happens also.

Please advise me what todo. 
Thank you...

Subject: Smallest Linux Distribution
Date: 12 Sep 1994 09:09:07 GMT

     Hi.  I'm looking for the smallest linux distribution available to
install on my computer.  I'm looking for the Bare Essentials only.  What I'm
trying to do is get the kernel, /bin, cc and a few other essential tools
on a file system so I can play around and install all major unix programs
(like Xfree, GCC, Emacs, etc...) on my own to get a lot of experience with
unix.  (Besides, it seems like a lot of fun and a good way to learn.)

     Does such a distribution exist?  If not, how would I go about doing the
above?  It seems that I would need some time of boot disk to put a filesystem
on my HD and to copy over a kernel and stuff like /bin.  I'm pretty clueless
on where I would ftp, say /bin or linux cc (or is there only a linux gcc?) so
I'd appreciate any pointers.

Thanks,

Date: 12 Sep 1994 07:12:35 -0000

If you've upgraded to a later kernel (e.g. 1.1.50) and you're using
ftape, you ran into a problem getting ftape to compile. Some kind
soul has put a patch on sunsite under kernel/patches/tapes to fix
the problem. Get it and unpack it in the ftape-1.13b directory. 
Then modify fdc-io.c.

In the request_dma function, add "ftape" as a second argument. All will
compile fine. I've tried it and it works great.

I use cpio(2.2) to make the backups like:

find /usr/src -print | cpio -ov -H newc > /dev/ftape

Hope this helps somebody.

===============================================================================

I think on the DOS side of the connection everything works, but that's just
a guess.

On the Linux box I have a SLIP connection running, with ip nr 130.161.97.21
This is only a node address. I got no subnetwork assigned.

The local network I called 1.2.3.0. with 1.2.3.4 for the linux box and
1.2.3.100 for one of the dos machines.

My rc.net looks like this:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/net/bin
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 broadcast 127.255.255.255
route add 127.0.0.1
ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 1.2.3.255
route add -net 1.2.3.0 gw 1.2.3.4

===============================================================================

I think on the DOS side of the connection everything works, but that's just
a guess.

On the Linux box I have a SLIP connection running, with ip nr 130.161.97.21
This is only a node address. I got no subnetwork assigned.

The local network I called 1.2.3.0. with 1.2.3.4 for the linux box and
1.2.3.100 for one of the dos machines.

My rc.net looks like this:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/net/bin
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 broadcast 127.255.255.255
route add 127.0.0.1
ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 1.2.3.255
route add -net 1.2.3.0 gw 1.2.3.4
/usr/sbin/routed &
/usr/sbin/inetd &


============================================================================

I hope anyone can help me with this.

Greetings, 

Perjan Moors
