I had a run-in with the comp.os.linux.development people over this
several months ago.

The general consensus is:

  Linux strives for POSIX compliance.
  POSIX states that the kernel sends HUP signals only to session leaders.
  POSIX states that session leaders should relay SIGHUP to children.
  Many session leaders (shells, usually) don't follow the POSIX spec.
  Lots of processes wind up chewing up CPU time.

So lots of multi-user admins wind up working around this POSIX "feature"
by writing daemons to kill the processes that Linux doesn't.

If it's any consolation, I've seen a large-scale commercial provider
running AIX grind to a halt because the OS is POSIX compliant and the
shells or applications [kermit, ytalk, and lynx were the major problems]
aren't.  They've got a daemon to work around POSIX now, too.

Good luck, everyone!

Rocco
(Who also has a daemon to work around this wonderful POSIX feature.)

I've -heard- of many people overclocking Intel DX2-66's as well, and even went
so far as to contact some fellow overseas (via the net of course) who was 
running his at 80 MHz.  I have a DX2-66 (SL enhanced, if that matters -- but
it still runs at 5 volts) and a clock-selectable motherboard (25,33,40,50).  
I'd -like- to be able to get a >20% increase in speed by moving a jumper, but
my main concern is the operaing temperature of the chip.  The way my MB is set
up, I have room for about a 3/8" high heat sink on the chip, but a CPU fan 
blocks three of my ISA slots (excellent engineering...), so I rigged a CPU fan
to blow -across- my heat sink, which is better than nothing at all.  Unlike
my friend's P60, which will fry eggs, I can -just barely- keep my finger on my
heat sink without it getting too hot to touch.  I'm just wondering if I can
keep my chip within specs (assuming it doesn't kill it right off the bat) with
the jig-rigged cooling setup I've got now.

Anyone have any input on this?

Because utmp should not be writable.  At best it allows users to fake
whatever, at worst it is a security hole which may allow file
manipulation.  I got told there already was a CERT advisory about that
long time ago, so no reason to scream in excitement :)

> More to the point, is there a better solution to this?

Yes.  Solaris has a suid root program for making and removing utmp
entries.  That way you don't need to have n suid root programs.  I am
not sure, but I think you can also allocate a pty that way.  Not that I
am really happy about that solution, but it certainly is better than
how it is done with Linux and SunOS.

Reply-To: francis.j.bruening@tek.com

Hi,

I think this is probably a general unix sys admin question, but
thought other "new" sysadmins might benefit from the answer.

Basically, I'm in the process of grabbing some apps off the net,
(OK, so they're mostly games.. ;-) and am wondering where the
standard or "correct" place is to install them.

I know to put the executables and man pages in the /usr/local
tree. HOWEVER, my question is where do I keep the sources. For example,
installing crossfire (an X role playing game) installs correctly in
my home directory, but I'd like to move it somewhere general.

Should I make a /usr/local/packages? What do others do? In addition, 
when I upgrade existing packages do I replace the old ones (ie. Xpm) or
move the new release to /usr/local and ensure my $PATH finds the new one
first?

I'll summarize the info I get back.

thanks!

All this is true but its NOT always the interface that makes the 
difference.  Much like steros systems, your transfer rate will only be as 
good as your worst component.  As an example, I have a large, slow SCSI 
drive on my  system and a much more modern IDE drive.  I get best 
performance by using my IDE, not my SCSI for swap....

Hi all.  I'm thinking about getting Windoze NT 3.5 to see if it runs better
than my Windoze for Workgroups... Anyways, right now I'm booting Linux using
Loadlin 1.4 and my MS-DOS 6.2 startup menu.  Anyways, I was wondering,
before I install NT, if I should worry about finding another way to boot
Linux.  I had a friend who had NT 3.1 and he booted that from a DOS 6.2
menu so if NT 3.5 works the same then Loadlin would still work.  Sorry if
this post is to the wrong group but I thought I'd try here first.  Thanks
in advance for any help.  (email reply would be greatly appreciated)

Just a guess: try a full-featured cable, or change your cable to make sure
that the CTS, DSR and DCD lines are active on the Linux side (wire them to
DTR). Possibly the kernel flow control gets confused by not connected
(i.e. floating) control lines.

Beat that!  As well, it is a good 10% faster than the dozen or so 8500s I
have and twice as fast as the 8200s.  

CARDS: The 1542C is a bit slower due to the fact that it can't queue up as
many SCSI commands as the 1742. I can't get the 2740 to work with the
alpha driver I have, but I think the drive becomes the limiting factor
then. Of course the Busteks are nearly perfect but cheaper clones of
excellent Adaptec products.

Future Domain 16xxISA and 18xxISA cards are next fastest, and then the
Always 2000's.

The WD7000 is slow, but faster than any other 8 bit or NCR5380 out there.
As well, they take more away from the processor.

You might say I have a variety.

Well, the only thing I didn't add was 1.1.51 for the kernel.  While
nothing is locking up, there is a lag while telnetting with an FTP
session going on that is annoying.  I've received a patch that I
hope to be able to roll in this weekend and do some serious testing.
Other things that run are Sendmail+IDA as a daemon, xntpd, and
CERN's web server.  The ftp session definitely takes over the system.

You didn't get it.  The aha152x line (and driver) is only
necessary if your using a AIC-6260 or AIC-6360 based controller
(aha1505, aha1510, aha1515, aha152x, SB 16 SCSI-2 and various
other computers that come with a SCSI-controller on board;
including the ZEOS board).

If you're still interested in the trailing 1:  The aha152x
driver supports the dis-/reconnect feature of SCSI devices, but
it can be disabled (by giving a 0 as last argument).

As usual on problems relating to scsi on linux: there is a
SCSI-Howto that answers most questions.
