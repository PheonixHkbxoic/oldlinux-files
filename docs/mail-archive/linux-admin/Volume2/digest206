"network is unreachable" is an error in your routes. It comes from one
place and one place only. It only comes from the networking software,
AND NOT PPP. Check that you have a route to the target IP address.

Both machines must have a route to the other.

Make sure that you haven't done something stupid such as putting your
host name on the loopback address (127.0.0.1).

X11R5 and X11R6 are slightly incompatable on the source level - that's not
astonishing. For instance try to compile the Motif Xterm wich lies on
sunsite in .../X11/xutils/terms/mxterm-R5-color.tar.Z. If you tweak it
to read the R5-includefiles it comiles ok. If you let it take the 
R6-includefiles it will fail in several subroutines due to changed definition
of some X-intrinsics. (This example is academic, because even if you 
succeed to compile mxterm with R6 you won't be able to link it, though. 
I just mention to show an example where existing R5 software is definitely
incompatable with R6 on the source level.)

Probably the best set of instructions on installation are in the package
itself. You will find a new set of instructions (well, slightly changed)
on ftp.netcom.com:/pub/longyear/ppp-2.1.2/ppp-2.1.2b.tar.gz.

In addition, there is a FAQ, or what I could derrive in one evening of
recalling the common questions, in the same package.

There is a "howto". It is part of the Net-2-HOWTO. I could no see writing
one for just PPP.

There is a chapter in the Network Admin Guide (NAG).

The package includes a man page. This is good as well. Most of the
documentation for chat is in the man page.

There is a general PPP FAQ for the protocol, in the comp.protocols.ppp
group. This is archived on rtfm.mit.edu.

follows:

Fig             this is a soft-link to Fig-color
Fig-color       this has a "include Fig"

relink Fig to Fig-standard or remove Fig and rename Fig-standard to Fig.

Subject: Loopback problem
Date: 14 Oct 1994 13:22:09 GMT

My goal is to get a SLIP going into a shell account with TIA.
I've read through the NET-2-HOWTO, and the TIA FAQ, and have 
(apparently) successfully run a dip script, which appears to work.  
If I try ifconfig, I get something like:

sl0   Link encap AMPR AX.25 HWaddr
      inet addr 192.0.2.1 P-t-P 128.155.17.47 Mask 255.255.255.0
      UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING MTU 1500 Metric 0
      Rx packets 0 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
      Tx packets 0 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0

However, I've apparently installed or configured something incorrectly,
because I can't even ping myself.

If I try "ping localhost" or "ping 127.0.0.1" I get:
      ping: unknown protocol icmp.

Or if I try "telnet localhost" or "telnet 127.0.0.1" I get:
      telnet: tcp/telnet: unknown service.

Can someone shed some light on this, or suggest a diagnostic
to reveal what I'm missing?

Thanks,

I agree with Dan. I just upgraded mine to 8 MB and X runs really smooth.
Before when I have only 4 MB, starting and application often take ages.
But now it is almost instantaneous. Also moving the windows around is
fast not like when I have only 4 MB. You have to wait a while before the
window moves.

I had this happen some days ago; one of my scripts, which ran perfectly

to dcron. I was unable to strip down the script to a point where I
understood what was happening - bash was definitely acting wierd.
The bug is too esoteric for me to track down, I simply solved the

dcron was definitely not the culprit, bash was.

The problem is that (at least for people with old BIOSes) there is no
CMOS setup for 3rd and 4th drives on the 2nd controller. That's why I
fake the logical geometry (bios_info[]) from the real physical
geometry (hd_info[]) in hd.c.

For people with the newer BIOS (EIDE), where it's possible to enter
geometries for 3rd and 4th drives on the 2nd controller, the correct
solution would be to enter the fake/logical geometry, EXCEPT Linux
doesn't yet read the EIDE BIOS entries. I was looking into it, I think
it means adding some assembly in setup.S. And assembly is not my
strong suit, so that's where I stopped.... Anybody?

Thanks, Delman.

I'm using only the servers and the fonts from 3.1. Everything else is

Subject: Re: Please don't post security holess...
Date: 11 Oct 1994 18:27:25 GMT

Well.. I've offended at least one person.  So, I appoligize.   Offence
was not my intent.

But, getting back to the subject of security holes, I have to admit
that I used to break into systems.  Back in my HS days (I don't have
any time anymore).   

One of the ways that I found holes in systems was by talking to my
friends who also did the same thing.  Therefore, I think that it is a
perfectly reasonable conclusion to say that (there is a good
probability that) the first person to know about a hole is a cracker
(thanks to whoever posted the correct terminology).  In my experience,
I knew about the holes that I used before the sysadmins did.

I used to think that breaking in was harmless too.  Lately I guess I
become sort of paranoid.  My system is on the net.  It doesn't have
very much, but it's mine.  It's my property, and in a way, it is my
virtual living space.  My cyberspace side of myself lives there.  If
you are breaking into my system, you are breaking into my dwelling.
So what if you just look around?  Does that make you feel any less
violated?

I have to draw one exception/line here.  As was pointed out earlier,
(someone said this, I forgot who) if you crack my system, and do
nothing else but let me know about my hole, you better believe that
I'm gonna be grateful.  But, once you've cracked my security, how can
I guarantee that you haven't done anything else?

I'm a freshman in college now.  I have freshman lab.  And there I use
a simple rule of thumb:  Once I'm in the lab, everything I touch is
potentially contaminated.  Either by me or by the guy before me.
Therefore, I don't scratch my nose when it itches.  I don't use the
phone.  Maybe my hands are perfectly clean.  But suppose they're not.
The potential harm is too great.  So it is with crackers.  Yes, there
are probably some folks out there who crack security and are harmless.
But what about those who aren't?  The risk of letting in the latter
makes it necessary for me to be paranoid about everyone, including the
former.  I'm sorry I have to be like that.  But, I have to feel safe.
I think that is a basic right.  That's why my system asks for a
password, and why your systems do too.  I don't think I'm being facist
or extremist to worry about things like this.  It is a part of life,
like guns and drugs.

Now I'm up to $0.04.  Soon I'll be bankrupt.

I upgraded my Linux box to XFree 3.1. Everything seems fine except one: when
I am running 16 bpp mode with olwm, all the windows (e.g., border, openwin-menu)
cannot display any colour except black and white. How can I fix this problem?

I am using Linux v1.1.53 + XFree v3.1 + Xview v3.2 + S3-805 display card.

Thank you.
