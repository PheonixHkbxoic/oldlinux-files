In the readme it says some S3 928 boards with the Bt485 palette are limited to
85MHz. When I run the S3 server with our board it prints a message saying this
limit exists. This is a pain as I want to run 1280 x 1024 @ 130 MHz. As we are
a PC hardware manufacturer (i.e. when I say it's "our" 928 board I really mean
it) I have considerable leeway in making changes to the board. What I want to
know, please, is what imposes this limit, and any ideas on what to change to
remove it.

If the getty does auto-bauding (switches its baud rate to the string
returned by the modem), it's necessary -- but I know no getty that does it
all the time (mgetty can do it with the "-a" option).

I recommend, for mgetty users, to have the modem return something like the
CONNECT <DTE speed>/<DCE speed> <protocol>/<compression>
string that ZyXELs can return, because that string is very good to see
what's going on -- but it's purely informational, not functional.

True... but I think he was talking about the destination address, not the
interface address... you can route either the loopback _net_, or the
loopback _host_, with equal facility.

Thanks Tim,

It's now working with 1.1.45 by using the following patch on the ftape sources:

   if (fdc.hook != &do_floppy) {

The difference is the last change wasn't needed with linux-1.1.45.  It
looks like the request_dma() function has changed in 1.1.50.  I also
found that irqaction() is a static function in the kernel source file
irq.c.

It to bad we need to keep changing source to keep out tape drivers
working, but that's progress. :)

Subject: Errors writing to MSDOS Partition
Date: 20 Sep 94 07:42:53 GMT

Hello,

I'm running Linux on a 386-33Mhz with 8 MB memory. I've an Adaptec
1542 SCSI Board and a 80MB Disk from SeaGate and a 660MB Disk from HP.
Linux works fine with the ext2 filesystem. Only writing on a msdos
partition almost ever leads to corrupt files. This happens only if
I write a file on my msdos Partion on the harddisk. Floppies do fine.

I found out that files get corrupted doing a "sync" or waiting until
the buffer has been copied to disk.

For example:

        cp file /msdos/file
        diff file /msdos/file

        no differences will be found until the buffer has been flushed 
        to disk.

Doing:  cp file /msdos/file
        sync
        diff file /msdos/file

        will show up differences in over 90% of the tries!!!!

My dos partition uses to second half of the HP disk (the upper cylinders).
I think the disk has about 1400 Cylinders, put I actualy don't know.
The partition was created using fdisk from linux and FAT 16 BIT as 
filesystem.

I hope someone can help me to fix this problem!!!

Date: 23 Sep 1994 17:22:05 GMT

        I can't find this in a FAQ so...  I need to find a way to
get linux to log people out on hangup.  If a user hangs up the modem
line, and there is a program that is running, linux doesn't kill it.
        My worst example is when people are using telnet via gopher.
They hang up and gopher telnet bombs the site it was connected to so
people have a hard time logging into the remote site.  (Our little
486 shut down the telnetd on the faculty Mini)
        Anyway, I have a cron script that kills most of them, but it
would be nice if there was a built in solution.  Thanks.

I have noticed the same thing-- I need to set the time with my BIOS

It depends on how well you want to do that.

You need a kernel, and the basic net utilities (ifconfig, route), the
mount program, umount, sync, init a new /var (you can mount this from
the server), a new /etc (you can do that also from the server, with a
little trick).

        Yes, but, why?!?!?! Patch never seemed to be broken before . . . (The
problem stems from the fact that patch declines to create any new files if you
run it from /usr/src without a -p argument. I found that if I went to
/usr/src/linux and used -p1, it worked. On my system, patch is version 2.1,
which seems to be the latest.)

        BTW, anyone feel like taking a stab at why my previously wonderfully
stable system (running 1.0.8, installed from SlackWare) will, when asked to run
1.1.50:

        1. Immediately reboot when asked to NFS-mount a remote directory 

        2. Always disagree with 1.0.8 about something in the ext2fs free block
bitmaps (if one fixes it, the other dislikes it) 

        3. Shortly after bootup, begin displaying fairly random trash on the
screen. First time I saw this was during a fsck - would up with a line of
blinking brown background/white foreground 'l's across the screen.

        I would guess :) that I need to upgrade some other utils/etc. Any ideas
on what?

Generally yes, but not necessarily.  Your BIOS looks down a list of
three possible parallel devices, and assigns the first one it finds to LPT1:,
The second to LPT2:, and the third to LPT3:.  If you have all three, then
the parallel port on your monochrome video card is LPT1, and the ports
with hardware address 378 is LPT2, and 278 becomes LPT3.  If you don't have
the video card parallel port, then 378 and 278 are LPT1 and LPT2.  If you
only have port 278, then it becomes LPT1.

Linux uses a 1-to-1 correspondance with the IO ports to the Linux devices.
lp0 is always the video port.  lp1 is the parallel port at 378, and lp2 is
always the port at 278.  Regardless of whether or not you have them them
in your system.

I have one parallel port at home: 378.  It is LPT1: under DOS, and lp1
under Linux.

A similar correspondance holds true for the serial ports at 3F8, 2F8, 3E8, 2E8
and COM1-4 under DOS and /dev/ttya-d under Linux.

Your mileage will vary depending on your hardware.
