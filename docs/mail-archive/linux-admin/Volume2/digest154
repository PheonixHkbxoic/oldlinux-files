I'm running Linux on an HP Vectra 486/66 XM.  It works just fine.

Someone else said that they were never able to get the onboard ethernet
controller to work... I initially had this problem, but I grabbed a
patch that was posted to C.O.L.A that fixed it.

I don't recall the exact details, but it involved patching a single
file (lance.c).  You can probably find it on sunsite.

The only other problem I encountered was getting the mouse to work.
It's a bus mouse and I had some weird conflicts with the mouse under
X, but only when the onboard ethernet was enabled.

But changing some CMOS settings cleared it up.  It's been a while and
my memory fails me, but I believe that I ended up changing the ethernet
IRQ.

Finally, I had to change the IRQ used for the bus mouse and recompile
the kernel.

If you do get the HP, feel free to contact me via e-mail for the 
specifics.

You are, of course, correct, and this is the way I have it set up now.
The problem is, w (and other commands) look much better if they return
just the first part of the name (so I'm aesthetic--sue me :).  On Ultrix
you can evidently use this format:

ip      short-form      fqdn            aliases

and it will use the short-form for stuff like w, but can still find the 
machine's fqdn.

Maybe the best answer is to recompile w... <grin>

Reply-To: kburtch@pts.mot.com
Date: Wed, 5 Oct 1994 17:42:10 GMT


I have a setup (still installing) that works nicely with big drives...

/dev/hda has 1322 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors.
/dev/hdb has 2100 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors.

I booted with an older boot/root floppy set (kernel 1.0.0, slackware...)
using the lilo line (recommended for PS/1 users in the preboot message)
boot: ramdisk hd=1322,16,63
and it loaded up, recognizing my first hard drive (that already had one
240M MS-DOS partition). 
Next I ran fdisk (linux) to create a second MS-DOS (*)primary partition
of 240M. * - MS-DOS FDISK.EXE will only create one primary partition, the
rest have to be inside an extended partition. 
I then rebooted into MS-DOS to format the new drive. (to verify it worked)
So far, so good... everything fuctions perfectly. Reboot into linux, using
the same command as before...
I then used linux fdisk to create a ~24M swap partition and ~145M linux
native partition... Reboot again, mkswap & mke2fs etc. perform minor install
and reboot into MS-DOS to verify everything still works... no problems! :)
Next, using loadlin, boot linux (loadlin 1.5 is from heaven!!) with the 
appropriate root=/dev/hda4 line... perfect! Run fdisk, and guess what?! 
Linux (1.0) not only knew the *correct* size of hda, it also knew hdb! 
(I thought I would have to have 1.1.50+ to automatically recognize them! :) 

So far, with this setup, I have _no_ device drivers loaded, and 480M set up
for MS-DOS, and Linux filling the rest of the space on the disk with no 
problems! I could have up to the MS-DOS limit (504M) using this method...


Here are the oddities...

After creation of the last partitions, if I load FDISK.EXE my partition
table lists the linux native (cyl 1025+) partition first, then the two
FAT partitions, then the swap. Apparently MS-DOS strips 1024 from the 
number in the partition table, and then thinks the partition is at the
beginning of the disk. It seems to function properly, and since MS-DOS
cannot access anything over 1024, my linux partition is safe. Since linux
is intelligent enough (what did you expect? :) to recognize cylinders above
1024, my MS-DOS partitions are safe. (except from the virus MS-Windows ;)

When creating a partition in the _second_ drive with FDISK.EXE, the
second partition in the _first_ drive was no longer recognizable by
FDISK.EXE or MS-DOS. :( Well, I tried checking the partition table with
linux fdisk, it was OK. hmmm... Next step was to delete the MS-DOS
partition from the second drive: POOF! like magic my second partition in
the first drive is now an MS-DOS partition with a readable volume name again
(FDISK.EXE) and everything is working again. I tried making an extended
partition on hdb to host the MS-DOS partition. (thinking MS-DOS can only
have two total primaries) No luck, same problem. I deleted the MS-DOS 
partition from the extended partition (left the empty extended partition)
and the problem still wouldn't go away. I deleted the extended partition
and POOF! (again) it worked. (linux worked in all instances! :)

Does anyone know enough about the partition tables to know why the creation
of a partition on hdb can effect the partitions on hda? Are they both stored
on hda?  (I thought each drive had it's own partition table)

You're welcome for the install advice, and 
thank you for any help any of you might offer me... 
I plan to work on it some more tonight when I get home, so 
I will try to keep you updated as to my 1.7G install. :)
(gotta love these drive prices!!)

P.S. This is an IDE system, not SCSI. (if it makes a difference)

Date: 2 Oct 1994 23:59:06 -0700

I have an Intel chipset P5-90 motherboard with a Herc PCI video card with an
ET4000/32W chip. The docs say it works but sometimes I get a flicker when
going into X and then a black screen. I can escape out with ALT-CTL-BSPC. The
system works great in Dos Mode and running Windows, in all resolutions. Once
in X, if I can see it, it works great, never even a little flakey. It seems to
not work in batches, maybe a few times, then works great for a while. I have
tried two different motherboards and two different video cards. The version of
Linux is the Yggdrasil Plug-N-Play, Fall Release.
Any ideas???
I check this group but wouldn't mind an email if you got a fix.
Thanks

You need to have a boot disk that gives you the LILO boot: prompt.  At that
prompt, type:

ramdisk aha152x=0x340,11,7,1

Then, when you get Linux installed, you will have to install LILO and
add the following line to the /etc/lilo.conf file:

APPEND='aha152x=0x340,11,7,1'

That should ge you up and running.

It's a matter of taste. One can decide to have the computer (controlled by you
and your wishes) to control the modem. Or one can decide to let a dump machine
(the modem) react in a sometimes annoying way for the caller (e.g. if there's
no getty - or such - running..).

In short: It's a decision if one uses the (imho better) possibilities that
exist or not.

Having the N disks (Slackware v2.0) installed one finds a file /etc/named.pid

So far, so good. BUT!

/usr/sbin/named does use/create its named.pid in /usr/tmp, not /etc !

The scripts /usr/sbin/named.restart|reload (they have softlinks in /etc) have
to be adjusted to use the right named.pid (and also to the path for named

Yes, I have RTFM (Ftape-HOWTO) but this tape drive is not listed

Disk partitioning and moving filesystems.
=========================================

Firstly I must mention that I have read
Wirzenius's newsarticle of 2 jul 1994 18:21 about disk partitioning.

However I have some questions.

I recently bought a 420Mb Conner ide drive.
And I have a 240Mb Samsung ide drive.

Currenly my 240Mb Samsung drive is my hda
and my 420Mb Conner drive is my hdb.

The partitions are:
Filesystem 1024-blocks  Used   Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda2  216012       173057 31799     84%      /     % linux root 
/dev/hdb1  385436            1 365529     0%      /hdb1 % new linux part 
/dev/hda1  5212           2636 2576      51%      /dosc % dos part

On /dev/hdb2 I have a 18Mb swap partitition.
Earlier I had a 17Mb swap partitition on /dev/hda3,
but that I deleted.

Since the 420Mb Conner drive is faster I would
like to let this become hda(by changing jumpers on the drives).
Then would like to have one big linux partitition on this,
besides the swap partitition.

On 240Mb Samsung drive I would like to have a small
dos/mswindows partitition and a  news spool partition
since I am planning to set up a news server on my box when I get
my slip connecting.

How can I accomplish this?

Especially installing lilo on the 420Mb Conner drive.

Actually, in the ever running catch up game between AMD and Intel the price

AMD is about to release, yes you guessed it, their 486DX2-80MHz!!!!!

From what I've heard through my venders, It will run about $20 more than an 
Intel 66MHz.

It doesn't matter if you're running X, MS Windows, OS/2, NT or any other GUI 
that you can think up, upgrading from 4 to 8 Mb of RAM is worth magnitudes 
more than the cost of the upgrade.  I've have seen (on the high, exagerated 
end of examples) as much as a 60% increase in performance.

And, next year, if you can afford 16Mb, buy it.  You can always convert the 
extra 4Mb into cache on a caching SCSI or IDE controller, or sell it to 
someone.

Good luck...

:                      -t secs: delay between warning and kill signal.

: I then tried using the entry for halt.  When I removed the '*' from its
: entry in /etc/passwd and tried logging in as 'halt', I got the message:

:    -halt: can't idle init

: Finally, I put this into /etc/inittab:

:    # What to do at the "Three Finger Salute".
:    ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -h now

: This means I can't trigger a reboot from the keyboard - I have to
: actually press the reset button.  No big deal.

: My instructions to shut down the system are:
:       1.  logout
:       2.  press cntl-alt-del.

: My questions for the net:
:       Can you really run shutdown as a login shell?
:       When would you log in as 'halt'?
:       When would you log in as 'sync'?
:       Is my method safe?  (filesystem damage, security, etc.)
:       Is there a better way?
