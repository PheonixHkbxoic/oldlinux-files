You can put a file called .message in any of the directories under ~ftp.
If you put it in ~ftp/ they will get the message when they log in.  If
you put it in any directories below that, they will get the message when
they change to that directory.

I don't know about ripquery, but upgrading from kernel 1.0.9 to 1.1.45 
with the CSLIP/SLIP and Swansea net stuff causes 'arp -a'  to see the 
32.xx.xx.xx hosts with  defined hardware addresses that seem much too
large for the ethernet cards I have seen.  I suspect maye this is in 
the kernel somewhere. It doesn't seem to affect my networking functions 
as far as I can tell.


I am on a Class C subnet with a PC router.  Its address is printed by my 
other hosts (ka9q NOS), but not Linux.

Hello Everybody!

I have a DX 100 / 3 with and APAPTEC AHA-1540CF ISA to SCSI adapter
driving a 1 giga byte hd. I installed the newest slackware
installation set and was quit happy for a couple of hours. The only

more than 16 heads ... giving up! But apart from that it worked fine.
I gave Lilo the hd-geometry via comand line. I installed everything

had no problems. Suddenly it crashed several times, but I was able to
reboot. A bit later it even refused rebooting! It stopped always with

fdisk /dev/hda (or just "fdisk" defaults to /dev/hda), now you are seeing
all the partitions displayed. Any danger results from not looking closely
at RTFM and what it says, if you go your own way, well then!

I have been messing around wtih XFREE trying to get it up and running with my

I can make it work if I run it in 2 color mode (lots of fun).  If I try to 
make it work in 256 color mode, I see stuff on the screen but it looks like it 
isnt synced up right or something.  I have tried several "auto-detect"

I don't know what is wrong, but for me PPP is faster than Term. With
PPP I get with ftp 1.7KB/s transfer on a 14k4 modem, with TERM is used
to be less.

There is one thing: PPP does not, like term, have priorities for
different clients of course, since underneath there is only IP.
This means that during an ftp transfer your interactive response can
become dramatically worse, unless you tell PPP to use small packets
(which would make ftp transfers somewhat slower).

If you transfer *uncompressed* files then TERM might seem faster
because it compresses the data that is sent over the link. PPP does
not, so you'd better compress first before you send large files.

Help. I have installed the latest Slackware distributions (from sunsite) of
XFree and XView. Everything is OK for XFree but my OPENLOOK ie Xview can't
find the proper fonts. It is looking for -b$h-lucidia........ fonts. I've
checked the fonts.alias files and have noticed that these fonts are already
aliased in the 75dpi directory. But still, all XView applications, including
olvwm (grrrrr) crash because they can't find there fonts. I've done mkfontsdir a
nd xset fp rehash and all that stuff but to no avail.

I noticed that the xview and olvwm .rc files use a shell variable called
$OPENWINHOME. And all menu and font etc references are loaded in relation to
this. I've looked and looked, but can't find where is var. is set.

Is it a Xresource ?
Where can I set this ?
Whats up with the fonts ?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

HOW YOU CAN GET SO MUCH KB/s ???
I get only 0.9 or 0.8KB/s with PPP with 14.4k modem :(
TERM gives me 1400cps (1.4KB/s) and it doesn't lag my link..

PPP will transfer *big* files slow ??? Or what you meant with that ?

I always compress files if they aren't compressed.
Expect text files, what aren't very big..

Porting should not be too hard. I have been working on a port

There it works, although I have not had too much chance to test it

It's not much to worry about. It normally means you are getting small
amounts of network corruption somewhere and dropping frames. Running a slip
link over speed is the normal cause of this.
