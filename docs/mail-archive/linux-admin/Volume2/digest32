Here are the results of my investigation:  

The incorrect permissions on /bin/_login were due to a mixup when
updating the shadow-mk package's Makefile to correspond to the 
Makefile from the other shadow release.  

** The 4755 perms do not appear present a security risk, however. **

The original /bin/login will deny any logged in user from using
the -f (username) option if they lack sufficient privledge.  Period.
Indeed, the only reason -froot was a problem was that /bin/login
determined that the "active user" calling /bin/login was indeed root
and therefore had permission to use the -f switch.  Any user, once
logged in, cannot use the -f option unless that user is indeed root.

For those persons interested in verifying this statement, log in
as a regular user and type "/bin/login -f root" or "/bin/login -froot"
and see what happens.  You'll not become root.  The problem was in
rlogin and console logins, where /bin/login was being invoked by
root itself, rather than being invoked as suid-root.  Apparently, the 
old /bin/login uses getuid() instead of geteuid() to determine the 
real user id of the user executing the program.

I don't know if this is relevent, but when I installed a panasonic 562 cdrom
(can't put my hands on the board's name - the one which supports 3 different
cdrom types), I had a mysterious new *parallel* port appear (in bios, dos and
linux), which I guess is the bios (or me) being a little confused. Causes no
problems and I haven't investigated. Hope this helps. I'd like an explanation
tho', if anyone feels like offering one.

This feature is still present, but is dynamically configurable

Subject: [Q] Does archie (still) work for you on Linux?
Date: 6 Sep 1994 18:13:59 -0500

I am having difficulty getting archie to work on my Linux box.  I know archie
used to work on Linux, because when we were at 0.99pl13 or so, it was working
fairly consistently.  Now since we've upgraded (now running 1.1.49), it seems
that archie just times out.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I did some
searching through the code, and it seems that some of the Linux libc does
things a little differently than other Un*ces (select).  This definitely 
affects at least some of the timeout code, which expects that select doesn't
modify the timeout param.  If anyone has fixed this, or if you have a version 
that works on Linux without timing out (I am using archie-1.4.1-FIXED), that
would be great too.  I know archie is still working, 'cuz it still works at 
school.

Any help would be appreciated.  MANY thanks.

Yes, after patching the original source a bit on my own, I found that

it's in extra-stuff/gnu-finger-1.37, definitely on

Compiles and runs without a problem; I did some extra changes though.

Solid Tech here in Finland just announced their Native version for Linux
of their Solid-SQL-server.
It is solid meaning it will run even with 4MB of ram as database engine!
Also the president of that company claimed Solid server to be the
fastest SQL server available.
Don't know about that...

Before Linux version there where database-engines available for many

Also, what happens when a user in X receives a talk request, but there

Last, I like being notified of new mail when it arrives, so I went out

It would be a good job, if somebody who is able to, would port CAP to
Linux. That would enable the Macintosh to mount Linux-Drives, since Linux
simulates a AppleShare-Server. As far as I understand it, The Linux-Box
will be able to mount Macintosh-Drives, when the Macintosh has turned on
FileSharing.

Right. That is the way, NFS/Share is integrated, too. You open the chooser,
click on the NFS/Share-Icon and NFS/Share sends a broadcast to the network.
Then you select a server, enter your username and your password and get a
mount-poing dialog, where you cann add/edit/delete the mount points.

I have just recently installed INN on a Linux box and it is working very well.
I had a few problems with posting after I changed the IP address of the machine
and forgot to update the hosts file, but I guess I deserved that :-). I
would definately recommend INN for Linux, espicially since all the binaries are
readily available.

I have slackware 2.0... They are in /usr/sbin . A funny thing about the 
RTFM attitude... After much dickering, I finially got perfmeter to work.
rstatd could only be run after portmap was running. I read many manpages

: Also, never, ever, never, ever, NEVER run e2fsck on a mounted filesystem.

That's right. Whenever you do a e2fsck, remount your fs read only. The
Best way is to go down in Single user mode, and if the update daemon
or bdflush is still active, get hime a kill -9 signal to terminate it.
Then, you do your e2fsck an after it is done reboot your system. All
these things should be in your /etc/bcheckrc and rc.S or rc.1 files.

Here's how it works on my system:
e.g, on my system, I type in "telinit 1" (My single user mode in my
inittab), this rc.1 terminates me all processes, 
then call login for root to log in or restart at a new runlevel (Thats
right, without Password, there's no Singleusermode on my system). When
I`ve entered my root-password, the only programms running are a bash
and the init process. Then, it is no Problem to do an e2fsck (Even
while mounted) since no Processes are tryinig to write to the Harddisk's.
