Which begs the question--why do we still use the old, old encryption?
I mean, with a shadowed .passwd file only one routine checks passwords
anyway, so why insist on an antique DES-based algorithm?  It would
be easy to hack in a more modern message digester like MD5.  You could 
even have salts and standard size passwd files (by adding characters 
and forgetting most of the digest).

I would guess this has already been done, as it's a pretty obvious idea, 
but at least it should be included with a shadow passwd package so people 
looking for higher password security don't have to shop around.

The reason is compatibility: if you share passwords over a network via
NIS or by rdist'ing /etc/passwd, the encryption algorithms must be
compatible. Inventing a new and better encryption scheme in a
compatible way is perhaps easily possible - but to convince all the
rest of the Unix world to change their systems to use the new scheme
would be too difficult.

Subject: Why doesn't Shell execute from hosts.deny??
Date: 5 Sep 1994 03:21:30 -0400
Reply-To: brut@io.org


Following the example in the Linux Network Administrator's Guide, I cannot
seem to get Linux to execute a shell command when a site is rejected from
/etc/hosts.deny.  I have the following in my hosts.deny:  


           in.ftpd: ALL EXCEPT LOCAL : \
                 echo "request from %d@%h" >> /var/log/finger.log; \
                 if [ %h != "vlager.vbrew.com" ]; then \
                     finger -l @%h >> /var/log/finger.log \
                 fi


as per the example in the NAG guide, and while I can get the system to reject
the ftp from connecting, the shell doesn't seem to execute.  I've tried a
simpler shell command but to no avail.  Can anyone point out what it is I am
doing wrong??

Reply-To: rbehm@mclane.in-berlin.de

Hi!

I'm trying to install a news system on my linux (1.0) which should easily interact with ifmail (or at least any fido gateway software), uucp, nntp and slip.

For several reasons (mainly the included nntp) I deleted the cnews system (which also was very slow on my computer) and installed the binary distribution of inn for linux. Everything seemed to work fine - no problems like these mentioned in the FAQs conce
rning innd not starting etc. Everything started - with ps -jax innd is seen to run with -i0 -p4.

I had no problems in connecting from an OS/2 computer with IBMs TCP/IP installed. Reading the news works, as well as locally with tin. But posting doesn't work, and in debugging with inews -h and looking at the syslog I got several error messages like 'ca
n't connect to server' etc.

Before going into detailed posting of my configuration and error messages: Can anybody tell me if I should continue with inn? I have no experience as a 'newsmaster' - cnews confused me with it's complex structure and the need for an external nntp package,
 and inn seemed to work fine first.

Date: 5 Sep 1994 08:26:52 GMT

I'm using Linux on a 486DX66 Labtop and I ahve the 
following serious Problem which really did cost me 
weeks of work and I could not get read of it. 

You are now my last change to get Linux work resonably.
If you cannot help me too, I'll junk this Linux-shit!

My Problem is the following:

Sometimes, when I start XFree86 it hangs and the only 
possibility that I have is to turn off my computer. 
Well this schould not be so bad, sometimes systems used 
to hang and for such cases there is the program 

                 "e2fsck"

to repair the destroied filesystem after such a crash. 
So I run it with option "-a" and it reports some errors, 
fix it and tells me that I schould reboot the system.
(It really repairs it because when I run "e2fsck" imediately 
afterwards with option "-f" it will not find errors any more.) 

During the reboot the system comes up with the message 
"filesystem clean, but when I run "e2fsck" after the reboot 
there are the same errors again there!!!!

So it will destroy my filesystem peace by peace every time the 
system hangs because I cannot repair the errors permanently. 
My last system was so destroied that it refused 
"root"-login!!!!!!!! So I got the newest version of Linux over the net, 
reinstalled my system and now I have the same shit again. 

So I hope that I made a mistake and you can tell me which, 
otherwhise it's impossible to run such a shity operating system 
on my machine.


If you have any idea please e-mail me:

Add the following line to net/inet/tcp.c (this only logs tcp but thats the
main stuff .. udp is connectionless so hard to log). [Put it up at the top]

                printk("TCP connect attempt to %s port %d\n",

With enough tty/pty pairs about 64 and it ought to be easy enough to 
double but a bit harder to pass. I wouldn't want to pass 64 sessions on
a 386/486 box without some thought anyway.

I for one use tar and then gzip -9 to get smallest files, but gzip and then
tar in two cases

1.      When I want to pull odd files out without uncompressing 30Mb of data
2.      For backups. If you lose a chunk of a gzipped file you can throw it
        away pretty much. If you lose a chunk of tar you can get the other
        files out still.

You are a little out of your depth I assume. Get the SOCKS package from
sunsite, get the tis firewall package from ftp.tis.com and join the firewall
mailing list mentioned in its documentation. Prepare to learn a lot - but
yes it can be done. BTW allowing only outgoing telnet/ftp is pointless
anyone can telnet to a freenet site or a public service and use that to
access other services.

Yep. The internet is fundamentally insecure. Mail security is up to the end
user systems and agree policy between systems. Roughly speaking never trust
any kind of email. If you want trusted (and secure) email get PGP installed.

I can imagine 32 sessions each ttysnoop-ed through additional pair (ttysnoop
can't deallocate/reallocate tty/ptys, can it?).

Thanks to Terry Dawson who advise I should upgrade the ifconfig and give

[Quoted from his e-mail to me]

It is simply an indication that your 'ifconfig' doesn't know
what the PPP protocol type is. You could upgrade it to a newer version.

You can get newer versions from:

sunacm.swan.ac.uk
net-tools-1.1.nn

where nn is the latest prior to, or equalling your kernel version.
