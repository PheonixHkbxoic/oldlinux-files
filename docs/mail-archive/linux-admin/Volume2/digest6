On most modems I know about, 'AT&F' turns *OFF* error correction. Try AT&F2 
and see what happens.

Date: Wed, 31 Aug 1994 11:40:33 GMT


Hi Linuxers,
I'm planning to buy a Targa 17" monitor and of course a new VGA card. 
I'm concerned about speed, therefore I have some question about that:

1) Up to you, wich will be the best buy for a VGA card (price/performance)?
   (I don't want to spend too much, for example for a Viper chipset).
2) When using a 17" monitor, what's the resolution on it and will I be able
   to have a full screen display or will it still be a "dancing" virtual 
   screen?, do I need a particular VGA chipset?
3) Do you know the "Targa" monitor's brand? Is it good?
4) Will your adviced card be fast with DOS, also?
5) Will having 2M instead of 1M onboard really speed-up my display?


PS: at present I have a Trident 8900C, it's kind of slow, right?


Very thank you guys,
have a wonderful day.

Ciao Nicky

Date: Wed, 31 Aug 1994 12:28:55 GMT

Hi,

I have dial-in enabled on my box with uugetty. It works perfectly with an acient 2400
Bd modem (the caller).  When the caller has an 14400Bd modem too, the connection is
made, but uugetty dies with a segmentation fault.

I think it has to do with the missing 14400 speed line in /etc/gettydefs. Is it safe
to add it bluntly? or is there any other alternative (locked on 38400, for instance,
instead of auto-select through circulating speed lines in /etc/gettydefs)

Any hints welcome, i want them to call!!

Thanx,
Steef

Subject: Floppy disk errors
Date: 30 Aug 1994 19:57:13 GMT


Since several kernel revisions I've encountered some reproducable errors
with handling floppy disks. The procedure is as follows:

    1. fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
    2. mke2fs -c -v /dev/fd0H1440 1440
    3. remove disk from drive
    4. insert it again
    5. e2fsck -v -y -f /dev/fd0H1440

Step 5 shows the message
    Block bitmap -151587082 for group 0 not in group.
If I try to mount such a disk before checking it, I get the message
    ext2_check_descriptors: Block bitmap for group 0 not in group
                            (block 4143380214)!
Another time I copied some files to a disk after creating the file system and
mounting the disk. Then after unmounting, removing, inserting and mounting
the disk again I got the two messages: 
    ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free blocks count for group 0,
                              stored = 1241, counted = 1377
    ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free blocks count in super block,
                              stored = 1241, counted = 1377

The problem still exists if I'm using MSDOG formated floppy disks.

I'm using e2fsprogs-0.5a with kernel 1.1.49 on 386 and 486 systems with
Adaptec 1542C and on 486-PCI with NCR53c7,8xx.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Subject: PLIP: Laptop to Desktop
Date: 30 Aug 1994 20:07:34 GMT

I have been folloing the recent discussions on PLIP setup
and after reading the HOWTOs and getting a cable made (following
the pin-out as described in NET-2-HOWTO) dared to try:

the desktop (sierra) is a 486/66 running Linux 1.1.18,
the laptop (oblivion) is a 486/25 running Linux 1.0.8.

After recompiling the kernels with the PLIP option, the desktop reports
        plip0: configured for parallel port at 0x3bc, IRQ 5.
on boot-up, the laptop says
        plip1: configured for parallel port at 0x378, irq 7.

then on the desktop, I do:
        ifconfig plip0 sierra pointopoint oblivion up
        route add -host oblivion
and on the laptop:
        ifconfig plip1 oblivion pointopoint sierra up
        route add -host sierra

but no luck: none of the network services (ping, telnet, ...)
work. They just hang.

"dmesg" reports this on the desktop:
        plip0: Connect failed in send_packet().
"dmesg" reports this on the laptop:
        plip1: wrong header octet
        checksum error

What did I do wrong ?
Are the 2 kernel versions compatible in using PLIP ?
Could it be that my laptop has a wrong parallel port chip
(something to that effect was mentioned in the NET-2-HOWTO,
 the laptop is a Midwest Micro Elite subnotebook) ?

Any help is appreciated.

I don't use xdm, but I'll take a look. I've followed this thread for a while
and _finally_ got xconsole to work with: 

startx >& /dev/console

which I've now aliased startx to. No problems (tho' it's probably a major
security hole or something; inelegant at the very least).

Tss, tss, Alt-F6 ! When "shutdown kills X, you go back to VC1, where X was
started first, so you're on a text term. In runlevel 6, the only text terminal
available for login is the 6 one, so you might have type the command on
this terminal, don't you ? To go back to this terminal, hit the Alt-F6 key, it
should work. at least it works on my linux box...

Perhaps not related, but on a similar note, when I get done using ftape on my

All that is neccissary is to boot up in "single user mode". On a SUN
I think you would give "vmunix -s" to boot in singleuser. (I only had
to do it once :-) ) I don't know what the same command would be in Linux
though. I'm sure it is possible. Then you can re-edit your passwd file
with vi. After all this was done, then I think a CNTL-D switched from
single user to multi-user mode. All this was about 2 years ago, so I 
may be rusty.

No, it should not. It has no effect unless you run it as root. (Haven't 
we been through this already?)

This package has caused so many people to freak out for no good reason 
that I am going to move it into the contrib directory on the next 
release... but for the record, I don't consider it a security hole. On 
the other hand, ignorant and/or unalert sysadmins certainly are. :^)

There is way to avoid checking whole filesystem during boot. 
The followind rc script has been taken from Slackware 2.0.0. 
Before using that make this with your kernel image:

rdev -R /vmlinux 1

where
        /vmlinux is your kernel Image.


#!/bin/sh
#
# /etc/rc
#
# These commands are executed at boot time by init(8).
# User customization should go in /etc/rc.local.

PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

# enable swapping
/sbin/swapon -a

# Start update.
/sbin/update &

# Test to see if the root partition is read-only, like it ought to be.
READWRITE=no
if echo -n >> "Testing filesystem status"; then
 rm -f "Testing filesystem status"
 READWRITE=yes
fi

# Check the integrity of all filesystems
if [ ! $READWRITE = yes ]; then
 /sbin/fsck -A -a
 # If there was a failure, drop into single-user mode.
 if [ $? -gt 1 ] ; then
  echo
  echo
  echo "**************************************"
  echo "fsck returned error code - REBOOT NOW!"
  echo "**************************************"
  echo
  echo
  /bin/login 
 fi
 # Remount the root filesystem in read-write mode
 echo "Remounting root device with read-write enabled."
 /sbin/mount -w -n -o remount /
else
 cat << EOF

*** Root partition has already been mounted read-write. Cannot check!
For filesystem checking to work properly, your system must initially mount
the root partition as read only. Please modify your kernel with 'rdev' so that
it does this. If you're booting with LILO, type:
  rdev -R /vmlinuz 1
         (^^^^^^^^  ... or whatever your kernel name is.)

If you boot from a kernel on a floppy disk, put it in the drive and type:
  rdev -R /dev/fd0 1

This will fix the problem *AND* eliminate this annoying message. :^)

It depends on what program you're using to telnet in...it seems that 
every one is different.  I have a mostly functional termcap for QVT,
and I'm trying to work with a friend to get a termcap for QM Win working.

I'd really like to see some type of termcap repository so that others
don't have to duplicate my efforts and I don't have to duplicate others
work.  What do you netters think?

Hi,
The /usr/adm/wtmp file records all logins/logouts.  Upon examining the system, 
I found that there isn't a file like that.  How do you enable this process?.  
Can someone help me out.

TIA

Reply-To: mayfield@itd.adelaide.edu.au


Has anyone experience in getting future domain tmc950 cards to work properly under
linux ?

Ive followed the advice in the FAQ's, managed to fdisk the scsi drives ok, but when
setup calls fdisk with the -l option to list partitions, it fails 'coz fdisk
reports on needing to set heads/sect/cyls etc. I overcame this by hacking the script,
but then during the format phase, it all locks up.

controller is at ca00 int 5, and has v6.0 rom from future domain, but the card looks
like a clone of some sort. when the system boots from floppy it reports ST01/02, and
shows scsi devices correctly.

I'm figuring theres probably something obvious thats escaped me ...

Any help appreciated.

I use Dell 433s/P Netplex with the same type of ethercard and I discovered
no trouble. I use Slackware 2.0.0 with kernel 1.0.9. Works perfectly. So:
check out the settings if IRQ channel and I/O address at your card and
compare it to the defaults in kernel source.

Subject: 4P Serial on same IRQ ?
Date: 31 Aug 1994 04:09:31 GMT
Reply-To: mayfield@itd.adelaide.edu.au


Ive set up an MS400 card with all 4 ports on irq7, using the AA4RE interrupt
sharing mod (4x1n4148, 1x4.7kOhm etc).

Every time I use setserial to set the serial irq's to 7, it locks up the whole
machine (I know it warns about this).

I have no parallel ports, scsi is on 5. Ive tried it as ttyS0-3, and also with
a dual port S0-1 with the 4 port at S2-5, as well as removing the 2 port and
just trying the 4 port as ttyS4-7 et al. same results all the time. I also tried
the IRQ commoned to 2/9 instead of 7 (2 is a standard setting for the MS400, 7
has to be engineered :-)

any help would be greatly appreciated !
