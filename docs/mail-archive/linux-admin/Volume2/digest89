Subject: Printing broken since Linux 1.0
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994 18:43:29 GMT

Since upgrading to Linux kernels 1.0 or greater I have not been able to
print correctly.  If I send a file containing the following text:

this is a test file for printing

to the printer using "cat test_file > /dev/lp1" or lpr the following text
is printed:

this!is!a!tesu fime!fos priotiog

Printing worked correctly on this machine using 0.99 kernels.  Yesterday
I tried 0.99.pl7 and 0.99.pl9 and confirmed that printing works correctly
using them.  The incorrect text is printed using kernels 1.0, 1.0.8,
1.0.9 and 1.1.45.  I have tried using both the polling driver and
interrupt driver (IRQ 7).  Both produce the same result.  An ls -l of
lp1 indicates:

crw-rw----   1 root     lp         6,   1 Nov 30  1993 /dev/lp1

The parallel port is on a VESA Local Bus IDE & I/O controller.  The IDE
and serial ports work correctly.  The printer is a Star SG-10.

Has anyone else seen this or have any suggestions?

I use an old Linux package called mdmXX.tgz to resolve this one. With some
changes in it, the result is to directly start the bbs instead of a standard
login process (Xbbs has it's own login procedure) and I added a quick hack
to make it write a temp file with the detected speed that Xbbs reads before
to start so it knows about the link speed.
Just my 2 cents, Laurent.

Are you saying that following the instructions in your modem's manual
is not working? Normally the factory default is to ignore DTR (don't
ask me why they choose this silly default most often) so you will want
to find the correct command to change that, and write that setting into
NVRAM. There is probably a similar setting for your problem, which is whether
or not the DCD line follows the real carrier or is always on. In my
experience, the factory default setting for this one is sometimes "incorrect"
too.

Compiles fine for me. valid() is part of the shadow library from
John F. Haugh II, the module is called "valid.c".
(I use an old version (1991), I may be wrong).

It seems that the shadow library you use has been created without
this file; you'll have to build it yourself (or get a correct archive
from somewhere)...

Normally you will find these in the network technician's lab...
But when you have limited experience with these, it will be difficult
to get info from it.

I'm looking forward to what you find out from whatever source.

When I want to print out the man pages in a nice neat format,  I do the 
following:
    groff -man manpagefile.1 | lpr

By default, this will produce postscript output.  If you read the man 
page on groff you will see how to change the output format.

Date: 19 Sep 1994 19:05:14 GMT

I am trying to compile mh 6.8.3 on a Linux 1.1.8 486 box with the
SlackWare distribution. I am using only the BSD4x options and the
SYS5DIR and POSIX options apart from the mail-specific
options. Following the copious isntructions, using either GNU Make or
the BSD Make, Pmake, I am unable to successfully compile mh. Please
point me to the correct source if this is a FAQ. Otherwise,I would
appreciate knowing what the right options are for the MH file to pass
to mhconfig to compile under Linux.

GNU Make tells me that it has found Multiple Target patterns and
complains and eventually stops, while pmake fails while trying to link
direct.o in the sbr directory due to conflicting defn. of a variable.
I believe this is a problem with the options I have chosen and perhaps
if I use GNU Make. Any clues or experiences with the same will be
appreciated.

Answers will be summarized.

Thanks,
Aditya

But in the /usr/lib/smail/config file,  There are blanks (spaces) after
all of the backslash characters on the Recieved control lines.
Remove the blanks and it works correctly.

Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 18:36:40 GMT

AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHH. Religious wars. Every week I give a seminar on 
installing and setting up Linux here in the Bay area. I show both 
Slackware 2.0 and Yggdrasil. Both install easily. I do not have the afore 
mentioned problems. However, first time non-hackers prefer Yggdrasil. 
Both have their (minor) problems. (Like other OS's don't... ha).

Get off it people. This is your support for Linux. It is these newsgroups. 

Yggdrasil is aware of the problems with installing optional components 
*THE FIRST TIME*. They also have a solution. The problem with the CDU31A 
driver is not their problem. It was a problem with the kernel. THEY fixed 
the problem and had a solution available via anonymous ftp within hours 
after finding out the problem.

Yggdrasil has been very responsive to problems with their distribution 
and try to help with problems that are beyond their control. They did not 
write the whole Linux source. However, they have made significant 
contributions to the source base which has benefited us all.

Yggdrasil is to be commended for doing the job that they do with their 
limited resources. They have not deserved any of the flames posted here. 
As for someone trying to make a buck by shipping a faulty distribution, I 
recommend seeing someone and getting on Prozaic.

I am not affiliated with nor do I work for Yggdrasil. I know the people that 
work there professionally and I can insure you, they do their best. The 
entire Linux community benefits from their existance.

And also $79.00 each for 5 -- I order 5 and mentioned them to a friend
on the "geek repeater" (443.65 in ATL) and they got snarfed up in abt
2 minutes!

The same guy I talked with at CSC mentioned they are selling NEW 2.1GB
external (!) SCSI disks for less than 900 bucks!  That's definitely 
gonna give the IDE drives a bit of a run.       
The only complaint I've had with CSC is having to hang on the phone while
all their sales people were busy... you might want to lean on the 
receptionist a bit!  :)

And yes, I know Ultrastore's gone belly-up, but at these prices who cares?
A $400. board for $79.?  If you have to have vendor support, you pay the
price... for my money I just buy two of the cards.  :)  (wish I'd ordered
10 of 'em now... coulda made a couple bucks at the next hamfest!)
