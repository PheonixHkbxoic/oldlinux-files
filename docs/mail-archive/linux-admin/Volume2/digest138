Howdy!

I have problem installing my copy of Linux (Dec 93, InfoMagic Inc. CD-ROM) 
from Harddisk (c:\install\a2, \a3, \a4...etc).

The problem is, everytime I choose to install harddisk (dev/hda2) with msdos
filesystem, only part of the items selected are installed. The rest give me a 
message such as:

        installing emacssup...
        read error on stdin : Unkown error


Can anyone help??!!

Many thanks!

I am having exactly the same problem with my Logitech SoundMan 16

activity on the SCSI Disks controlled by the AHA1542B!  There is a section
in the Sound-HOWTO talking about the problems with the PAS16/1542 Combo.
But so far even with some suggestions from the contributor of that 
particular section in the HOWTO, my problems persist!  Adjusted the DMA
Bus On/Off times to 8/8, moved the AHA1542 to the alternate I/O Address
and disabled the MPU-401?  I do NOT get the parity errors that Stan talks
about and there are NO similar problems under DOS/Windows.  In terms of
having much control over the ISA Timing or understanding what the Symphony
Bus Chip is, I have little control.  There was some slight improvement
when I adjusted the DMA Bus On/Off Timings in drivers/scsi/aha1542.c 
(Linux 1.0.9), but it is still far from being satisfactory!

IMHO: if you're doing some real CPU intensive stuff (Like engineering

but for most huge block moves (Like X & fileserver apps) the DX/50 should
trash DX2/66 with PCI/VLB display & HD controllers

Here is yet another attempt at hacking scripts to make the best of the

                /pub/ppp

The machine is running on a ppp link so if you cant get to it wait for 
about 15 min and try again.  Thats the way I have my scripts hacked at
the moment.

Also maybe all of us how are writing/modifying these scripts could get
together and write some sort of a FAQ for PPP related stuff.  I am willing
to help coordinating the hole thing.  Those how are interested please send

Do you really think that 'dd' is the limiting factor.
With following example dd transports about 200 MByte in 12 seconds:

At the risk of getting more abuse, I answered a similar question
the other day. My way is simply to turn on Auto Answer on the modem.
(Usually DIP switch 5)

When I posted this the other day, I got a followup from someone saying
that was no good, because he didn't want the modem to answer the phone
when Linux was crashed. I don't understand. I have a dialup system
here in the office which I have set up as a Slip server. The modem
is set to Auto Answer, and I don't have any problems. 

Perhaps the person who replied before would care to expand his comments...

BTW, you could try reading the modem manual ! (grin ..)

With newer libc's, the location of the utmp file might have changed.

Run the following:
strace -o /tmp/who.trc /bin/who
This will generate a system call trace in /tmp/who.trc. Look at that
file, search for 'utmp' - you should see an open() system call with
the path listed.

I don't know SVGALIB, but either a program linked to it needs r/w access
to /dev/port, or it has to be setuid root (chown root prog;chmod 4711 prog)

If you have the choice, prefer X programs over SVGALIB ones.

Yes, do this:

chmod 4711 /usr/bin/chsh

These slipped by when I upgraded to util-linux-1.10.  The fixes were made

Subject: Linux and hard disk problems
Date: 3 Oct 1994 02:32:12 GMT

I just installed Slackware release of Linux from the InfoMagic CDROM.  I 
used a NEC 3X hooked to the SCSI connector on a SB16 card.  The install 
went fine, and the system boots.  The (problem or question) is that the CD 
ROM is no longer in my PC (it was just used for the install).  Will this 
cause a problem?  I am assuming no, because it boots ok.  I have been 
having trouble with the kernel detecting a Mitsumi CDROM (revision 00)  I 
think it is finding my BOCA Lan card... any help?
        On final question, what is the easiest way to get Linux to mark 
of bad blocks of the hard drive?  I ran fsck.extfs on it and it seemed to 
mark of bad blocks, would it be better to re lowlevel format (MFM) the 
drive and start over (not really a problem.... but would like to not have 
to reconfigure the system)

Thanks

That's the cause: no .plan file. Create a plain text file containing what you 
want others to know about yourself, and save it to the filename .plan - then 
when you're fingered, they'll see not only the contents of the .plan but the 
additional info, too.  Just make sure the file is accessible from "outside" :-)

Hi, we had one few months old slackware installation here which did just that

Most (but not all!) modems out there won't pick up the phone unless
they see DTR assserted by the PC. If Linux has crashed, (depending on
the crash :) DTR is likely to be low, so the modem won't answer.

However, for something a little more concrete here, check out the man
pages for uugetty; it will do nifty things like chat scripts on the
modem, so it won't answer until it sees a RING come back.

mgetty also has the same functionality.

Cheers,

Phil.

Pretty unlikely, I'd think, since Apple likes to keep internals to
itself...

I just stick in a floppy, choose "Erase Disk..." from the Finder's
Special menu,
and "DOS 1.4 MB" from the "Format" pop-up on the resulting dialog.  This
gives
me a DOS-format disk; I then copy whatever files I want directly to it. 
No need
for third-party software.  I'm running System 7.1.

This doesn't correct the newline conflicts, of course - the Mac uses a CR
(0x0D),
UNIX and Linux a linefeed (0x0A), and DOS uses both (0x0D0A).  But that's
a
trivial filter to write.
