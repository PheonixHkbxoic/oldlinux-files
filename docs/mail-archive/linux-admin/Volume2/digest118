Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 11:37:59 GMT

I've got linux (Slackware2.0) recently installed on a 468-66.  It has an 
ethernet card and is networked to Novell and and UNIX.  When ftp/telnetting 
from linux to elsewhere things generally work well.  However, when trying to 
ftp into the linux machine (most notably from the novell network) the 
session frequently freezes.  Pressing cntl-C returns the ftp prompt, but the 
last action ends up being truncated.  A good example of this is a file 
transfer.  All packet but the last one get through.  Then it freezes and the 
last packet it lost.

Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?

Subject: dosarch tape drive on linux???
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 11:49:48 GMT

I've got a tape Shuttle that runs DOSARCH on MS-DOS machines to back up 
data.  I'd like to use it to back up data from linux as well.  The tape 
shuttle is simply called "tape shuttle 525" and it has both SCSI III and 
parallel connectors.  The parallel connector is generally used with DOS 
machines, and since my linux machine doesn't have a SCSI port I'd like to 
use the parallel port.
Is there any way I can use this to back up data from linux?
If possible I'd like to use the same format (?) as Dosarch does on MS-DOS.

This misunderstanding probably comes from the fact that sendmail DEBUG
mode allowed remote execution of commands (worm etc) but smail's debug
mode simply allows to to specify the verbosity of it's commentry on
what it is doing.  I've pretty carfully checked through the smail
source and can't see anywhere where having the DEBUG on causes any
problems.

Subject: Term problems
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 21:03:21 GMT

Hi Folks,

        I'm having a tough time setting up 'term'.  When I run linecheck,
I get the following output (stderr) on the local and remote machines:

Local machine                   Remote machine
=============                   ==============
Handshaking                     Handshaking
                                Handshaking sucessful
                                  0 sending char

After that, both linechecks hang.  I start the remote linecheck as:

        $ linecheck 2> /tmp/linecheck.remote

and the local linecheck as:

        $ linecheck < /dev/modem > /dev/modem 2> /tmp/linecheck.local

When the remote linecheck first starts, it spits out an 'A' on the screen.
As soon as the local linecheck starts up, the remote linecheck spits out:


 B

  0 ABC

on the screen.

        The problem seems to lie with the remote machine.  Both remote and 
local machines are PCs running Linux.  If I make a connection to a remote
machine running Ultrix (via the same route) everything works fine.
A similar problem seems to afflict file transfers via 'sz' from the remote
system.  In this case the locally-running 'rz' creates a new, zero-length
file then hangs, waiting for data.  As with term, the problem goes away
when the remote host is a DECstation running Ultrix.

        Here's a description of the local and remote systems:

Gateway 4DX2-66V
Linux 1.0, 1.09 or 1.50 (same results with all)
Term 1.08
'setserial -a /dev/modem' yields:
/dev/modem, Line 1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3
        Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
        Flags: spd_normal skip_test
Same reults with a 14.4 kilobaud internal modem and a 2400 baud external modem.
Seyon 2.14b or minicom 1.5beta (same results with both)
Connection to the remote machine is made via a dial-in line connected to a
  Cisco terminal server.

        Does anyone have any suggestions?

                                Thanks in advance,
                                Bryan

nothing would appear on screen until I typed the last 't', and then the whole

I am trying to enable dial in access to my linux box here at home. I printed
out the README for getty_ps and as per the file I changed my inittab and
gettydefs as I felt appropriate.

The verdict ? I try calling from my other line and it doesn't pick up.

This is the deal.

my modem is on COM1 (under DOS) and is a USRobotics Courier Dual Standard 
(16.8k bps HST speed, 14.4k bps v32bis)

If somebody could either send me the appropriate config files or some
meaningful insight on getting this going I would appreciate it.

Thank you.

That's certainly a provincial attitude to take about it.  I, on the other
hand, have heard plenty about it, almost all inferior.  The system is not
standard enough to port 1/10th of the stuff we love Linux for, according to
those I have heard from.  So if you want a nearly-real-time fast unix that is
too nonstandard to use any but the vendor-supplied tools on, feel free but
don't come here for sympathy.

I stand ready to accept flames since I too have not actually used QNX, but
only accepted second-hand info on this.

Have you considered using the X Display Manager (xdm)?

Xdm provides services similar to those provided by  init,  getty
and  login  on character terminals: prompting for login name
and password, authenticating the user, and running a session.

To start a xdm session simple type "xdm" at your command prompt.

Last Sunday evening I made console resizing as an application
of dynamic virtual console allocation. Hope to put kbd-0.88
on funet tomorrow or so.
It works like this: (i) get svgalib, compile and put the program
restoretextmode in your path. (ii) get (by whatever means, e.g.
by rebooting linux with vga=ask in the lilo config file, or by
using something under dosemu) the console video in the desired
state(s), and say "restoretextmode -w file" to store the state
of the video hardware. (iii) After this preparation you can at
any moment change the console size by saying something like
"resize 50x80". The program resize will reallocate console
screen memory for all virtual consoles, send a SIGWINCH to
all programs involved, call "restoretextmode -r file" to set
the video hardware, and call "setfont font" to get reasonable
characters. For me it works beautifully.

So, it seems that this replaces the question "Can I get 50x80
text mode under Linux?" by "Can I get the video hardware into
50x80 text mode?".

We have had lots of problems with the Sliplogin program here: When a user 
disconnected, in some situations the program would not kill itself. The fault 
is in the:  close() function, which does sometimes not return. I have tried up 
to kernel 1.1.50.  I have written a patch in the source of sliplogin, which 
kills the program after 15 seconds, if close(0) does not return.  However, 
this must be a Kernel problem.
