I am running 1.0.9 and net connections stay around even though they are
long closed on the netstat table, and eventually I get a too many open
sockets error.  Is there a fix for this?  I tried upgrading to 1.1.46 and
1.1.50 but they both just hang after a while..so that's no help at all.
I may try 1.1.33 later.

Hallo all,

on my Linux machines I have the problem that
some people are using DD-Diskettes but others
HD. How can I let everyone mount the diskette
type he wants.
It's a permission question and I 'm generous but
not everyone should have the root-passwd.
I scanned already UNIX-FAQ(with grep) and there was
nothing about it. 

Help

In addition, the 33 MHz motherboard will allow for VESA local bus, which 
I would highly recommend getting.  Actually, every motherboard I've seen 
lately that'll go to 50 MHz is a 33/40/50 MHz (sometimes even 20 & 25) 
with local bus.  The VLB slots won't work at 50 MHz, though.

Don't cheat yourself.  Get a DX/33, DX/40, or a DX2/66.

We just picked up a couple Pipeline 50 boxes from Ascend. They run somewhere

If you have a process that is waiting for i/o, it won't see the kill
signal. I'm not sure how to get rid of it short of a shutdown. Sorry.

Hmmm, last I checked he is right.  CTRL+ALT+BS ==> change resolution.
Of course, I would prefere pixel doubling since:

  1. Change the resolution really confuses the Mach32 driver.  Once
     in a while after doing something like that it gets locked in a
     scrambled state and I must reboot befor I can use X again.
     (Restarting X doesn't help.  I aviod switching to VC's for the
     same reason.)

  2. Fvwm doesn't work properly with resized screens.

  3. My lower resolution modes aren't as clear as my high resolution
     modes.  (i.e. I can't fine-tune the screen edge positions or prevent wavy 
     screen edges below 1024x768.)

But, these are just minor inconviences that I can live with.

It _is_ included, but it's also described as "a pretty bonehead thing to do"
most likely due to the simple fact that it doesnt work!!

I've found better results using twm as it uses even less memory than fvwm and
the window manager doesn't count anyway.  I would suggest using a script which
calls xinit -exec twm & linuxxdoom or something of the sort.  (calling a
different resolution in the script should be trivial, too... ( I think...)).

This is correct. Both ping and rlogin need to open a socket lower than the 1024
mark. As only root can do this, they need to be SUID root in order to work.

    You might be able to kill off zombies by killing their

Isn't "gn" the server? I think you still need to run a Gopher client to
look at the data.

the command 'route add default gw $GATEWAY metric 1' at the end of

some such thing).

I have the latest version of tcpip from the slackware distribution,
and I am using kernel v 1.1.45 with an ne2000 clone.

ifconfig recognizes the hardware--I just can't set up the routing
table. I have the proper information (the gateway, nameservers, etc),
and, yes, the GATEWAY variable _is_ set to the gateway address by the
script.

respond wherever appropriate.

One word of warning with INN & linux; you definitely have to have

it came cfg'd in my installation. Read the INN FAQ carefully: you MUST
have your own site in your hosts.nntp; and your readers must either
know how to issue "mode reader" to innd; or read the spool file direct.

the version of rtin that comes with the slackware dist works ok - the 
version of nn is not nntp-aware by default, but works ok. with TIN, I 
had to configure it _not_ to use its inbuilt inews, whcih failed dismally.
also, be very anal about a search-and-destry mission for any cnews inews - 
slackware installs BOTH by default. oh, the version of nn that i got
doesn't seem to be NOV aware, so I'm still using nnmaster.

hope this helps you. ciao, scot.
