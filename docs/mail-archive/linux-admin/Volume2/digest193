I'd say also. We have a 486SX25 with 20M of RAM, on user sitting at
the local X Server and up to three users running a few clients from
X Terminals. Then this machine is e-mail/news/fax server. We don't experience
problems except when sometimes (bad luck if everything tries to start
at the same time) the load hits 6 or above. Then the response time
degrades (but what would you expect??)

I have a similar problem with 1.0.9 and the problem was fixed
by changing  out an el-cheapo LAN card.

I rebuilt the kernal a couple of times, even up to 1.1.21 and still
had the same problem.  FTP freezes up, can't log in, can't ping...

HARD BOOT !! (Which BTW really bothers me..)

Changed to an SMC card and never had the problem again.  Maybe its
in the generic device driver, maybe the H/W, but spending 50 more
bucks on a good card is well worth it.

The output gets mailed to the user who submitted the cron job.  This

Improbable.

DAT/DDS drives employ similar rotating head technology as
videotape drives, which are known to be capable of "assemble cutting"
subsequent recordings.

There is, of course, the time penalty for stopping tape motion,
backing up, re-scanning the previous record for synchronization, and
on the fly switching to writing just in time.

Breaking into computers and 'looking around' was somewhat socially acceptable
when computers cost megabucks.  Today, when you can buy powerful OS like linux
for the cost of a telephone call and fast processors for a few hundred bucks,
hacking and cracking is rapidly losing its status.

Subject: Tool to find bad blocks?
Date: 14 Oct 1994 13:50:58 GMT

I recently upgraded my hard disk, but this involved a swap of drives in
the lab.  Since the swap of drives, I have been having a stream of
sudden and complete freeze-ups.  These freezes occur only when I'm
doing something live at the computer -- typically (although not always) when
running X, frequently initiated by a launch of some large program (such
as something using Motif).  (I can leave the machine on overnight, and 
return to find it running -- it doesn't crash if I don't do anything).

My suspicion is that there are bad blocks, maybe even in the swap
partition.  Does anyone know of a tool that can identify bad blocks
under linux?  My read through the man page for e2fsck tells me that
it can mark the bad blocks, but one has to supply the list first.

Any other thoughts are welcome.

More details on my system:
 linux 1.1.51, gcc 2.5.8, libc 4.5.26, ld.so 1.4.4

I installed the new drive by mounting both the old and new, and then
running cp -a from the root of the first.  It gagged when it got to the proc
directory (no surprise), but I then subsequently cp'd over the usr, var,
and tmp directories.  

Thanks for any help.... John

Here lies the heart of your problem.  Mixing netmasks is a no-no.  You need
to have a netmask of 0xffffff00 for *ALL* of the network, with routers to
each of the sub-nets.  Thus, 152.52.0.0 is a *SEPARATE NETWORK* from
152.52.1.0.  There is no real way to sub-net a sub-net, if you know what
I mean.

You may be able to fool it into working, however.
Try (from the linux box)
  route add -net 152.52.0.0 gw 152.52.9.1    (or similar).
This would be a kludgy kind of thing, though.

For every other machine on the network (big network) that wants to talk to
linux, you would need:
  route add -net 152.52.9.0 gw 152.52.2.241   (or similar).

All warranties, both express and implied, are *VOID*.
