Check out ipfirewall0.1.... I found it either on sunacm or sunsite anon ftp.
(Full site names in NET-HOWTO) If it works.. it looks like it would give total

I am in some trouble here!!!!

I got a CDROM version of Slackware 2.0 and I tried installing it on my
system. THe problem is that the disk will not recognize my SCSI controler.

What I have is a FOREX VLB - SCSI 2 controler. It works great with dos and
windows but Linux will not recognize it!!!


If anyone has any experineces with it please let me know!!! I would really
hate to get rid of it for another controler.... but I do need to run
Linux! 

BTW: Forex does have an SCO UNIX driver if that helps!!! And the company
seemed real friendly and said they were going to try and look in to it.
But you know it is a company... and they really had no idea what Lynix
was!

I believe defining a domain and a class C network for just for a slip/ppp 
connection is unnecessary (as well as wasteful of class C address space). On my 
PPP link to my net provider, the local side of PPP is my host/router address, 
and the remote side is my providers host/router address, no additional net 
addresses needed. (This information according to my net provider)

I am having a problem getting packets to forward between PPP and my Ethernet 
using the above configuration (despite an apparently correct routing table) 
even though both local and remote hosts have no problems reaching Linux.

Can someone using Linux as a router please clarify this???

Did you compile your kernel with the IP Forwarding/Gatewaying option turned
on?  You need to do this for it to work as a router.  Not sure what kernel
this appeared in, but it may not be in older ones.  It's definitely been
there since the 1.1.4xs, and my 1.1.50 has it too.

OK.OK.  It was a wrong DNS entry that caused the previous stint.
BUT, WinTrump is sending requests to the Linux Box or Sun with the
default gateway appended to the address.  It does not go away.  This is the 
real problem.  it tries to resolve sunsite.unc.edu.test.bed.  When named
responds with 'invalid network' WinTrump should drop the test.bed default
domain name and try again.  It doesn't.
gate.test.bed.test.bed IN CNAME gate.test.bed. just doesn't work either.
It's not smart enough to understand CNAME responses.
ACK!  Am I stuck!???

This is of course the problem. Some clown^H^H^H^H^H character sees a question
they believe is characteristic of a recent DOS/WIN user and has to show how
unix/linux they are... a kind of "pc pc", I guess. Fact is I still use DOS/WIN,
altho' most of my time's spent on Linux (which actually surprised me, altho' I
was told to expect it). But that is because there is so much to learn. And it
shines in anything to do with programming/development. I had yearned to use
emacs as it should be used, and was not disappointed. 

Still, my job involves PageMaker/ATM etc -- and until the unix release of this
package, I'm afraid there is nothing else I can do. And when it is released
(soon I believe), I wouldn't be surprised to discover that on the same hardware
performance will be worse that DOS/WIN. And it won't be free, anything but.

Nor do I find the situation cause for shame -- PM5 in windows is fast,
immediate and *useable* -- and well-supported -- and paid for by my boss. I
mean imagine doing it in TeX (and then finding a bureau). Design by tag is no
fun, except for long, very consistent documents (look at all those man pages
where noone's noticed that the heading's too long, and it runs into another).
Not to mention TeX disk space requirements. 

In summary -- horses for courses. And I thought the idea of Linux was to free
us from the tyranny of *one* operating system -- not merely to impose a new
master, a new dogma.

I remember the thread about passwords longer than 8 chars, does it also apply 
to user names?

Here's the deal:

I installed NCSA httpd 1.3 and want to set up an account "webmaster" that has 
jurisdiction over the whole thing (its kinda the standard thing to call such 
an account).  Everything on that front is A.O.K.

I can log in at the console as "webmaster" and "su webmaster" however, I 
cannot telnet or rlogin in as "webmaster"  I get the standard "invalid login 
name or password" jazz

I've verified that the password is right; I've also changed the /etc/passwd
entry to "foobar" and can log in using foobar and the "webmaster" password 
(foobar owns everything its supposed to, etc).

I'm using Ygg Summer94, with updated kernel 1.1.45

(Come to think of it, I sucessfully proto'd my setup about 8 months ago using 
0.99.14 from TransAmeritech, and it worked ok to my recollection)


Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: disappearing kernel?
Date: 11 Sep 1994 15:29:17 GMT

I just had something strange happen to me...  First of all, Linux crashed
last night after months of flawless operation.  I could still switch to
other screens with Alt-f*, but I couldn't type anything.  So, I rebooted.
This morning, after playing a little while, it crashed again, but this
time, I couldn't even switch to another screen.

So, I decided it was time to try out a new kernel (I was using 1.1.35),
and I ftp'd 1.1.45 from tsx-11...  Well, after I untarred the file, I
went to go backup my /vmlinuz file, and IT WAS GONE!  No trace whatsoever.
All that was left was /vmlinuz.old, my backup from 1.0.9!

Does anyone know of a bug in DOSEMU, ncftp, tar, or gunzip that could have
caused this?  I believe those are the only programs that I ran before I
noticed the kernel missing...

Here's what /var/adm/messages reported:

Apparently the printer's language-autodetection is off.
If you can't turn it on or if it is on but doesn't work
for some reason (I've found it quite reliable, though), you can
(1) convert your ASCII files to Postscript
    (filters for that shouldn't be hard to find)
(2) prepend ASCII files with
    <esc>%-12345X@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = PCL<lf>
    which forces the printer to PCL mode.
    How to hack that into a printcap I've no idea
    (note that it mustn't be done with PS files).
