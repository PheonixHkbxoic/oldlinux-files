I would expect it to work that way.  I have used such a card myself in the
past, but not with Linux.  The card I use now is not that different from it.

Note that you must pass the flag '^fourport' to all setserial commands
on ttyS4 and above, as they are defaulting to AST Fourport cards which will
cause trouble.
I would put the board in the ttyS4-7 region to avoid it being autodetected
with the wrong interrupts at boottime.

Subject: DNS & 'format error no SOA record...'
Date: 31 Aug 1994 14:37:23 GMT


I'm trying to setup named on a linux system (it will be on the
internet in a week or so).  I try to run named but I get errors in my
syslog saying that I haven't defined a SOA record.  I followed the
examples in the NAG and I've stared at named.boot & named.hosts but I
still can't see whats wrong (I do have a SOA record, makes perfect
sense to me...)  Are there file permissions that need to be set?

Is there something stupid that I'm overlooking?

My SOA record looks like this: (from memory)
;
; Origin : crocker.com
;
@       IN      SOA     dns.crocker.com. (
                        matthew.crocker.com.
                        1       ; serial
                        4000    ; refresh
                        4000    ; expire
                        4000    ; minimum
                        )
        IN      A       dns.crocker.com.
        IN      MX      rmc1.crocker.com.

[...]
        
The numbers for refresh & expire etc are not what I have in the file,
I'll have to get the actual files and post them in a few days...

Any hints?  Can anybody send me their working named.boot etc?
just tar & gz & uuencode them to my email...

There are several things that you need to think about:

1.  As mentioned, the 'CONNERBUG' flag may need to be defined in the
    source.  When the CONNER (DOS and WINDOWS) program formats the
    floppy, it writes an incorrect value in the header.  If you
    bought a preformatted tape, you shouldn't have this problem.
2.  Look at the messages produced by the driver.  I'm pretty sure you
    can see them by running dmesg, or maybe they end up in a file
    in /var/adm - I forget.  In any case, they'll tell you a lot.
3.  I often have to erase the tape - mt -f /dev/ftape erase before
    using tar.

By sheer coincidence, I was reading this newsgroup to ask this very
question (which probably isn't limited to smail, but it's the one I'll
be using).

How should one configure hostname/return address on SLIP connections?
The hostname/ip address I'm assigned changes everytime I make the
connection; besides, I don't really want replies sent here - I want
them sent to a host that's up most of the time.  And other users may
want to have replies sent to other hosts.  And having something like
"myhost.subdomain.domain" in the headers looks ugly, even if replies
aren't going there.

So...is there a way to have the From: field (or alternately, the
Reply-to: field) set differently on a user-by-user basis?  I'm using
the version that came with Linux Slackware 1.2 (version 3.something,
maybe?) but I'm assuming this is a fairly generic question.

[I realize a thorough reading of the smail manual would answer most of
this, but I've only been able to locate a 1988-vintage copy of it, and
it won't print on our laser printer for some reason.  Can someone
point me to where I can get the latest manual, without having to
download the whole distribution?]

Thanks.

It really is no big deal. One time in the 33 days your system needed
all the real memory, so some *unused* processes got swapped out.
Since then they are *sleeping* in swap because nobody woke they up :-)
Of what use would it be to swap those *sleeping* processes back into
real memory?
Look at a ps -ax from my box:

  PID TTY STAT  TIME COMMAND
[snip]
   38 con S     0:00 /usr/sbin/syslogd
   40 con SW    0:00 (klogd)             # <- look here
   42 con SW    0:00 (inetd)             # <- and here
   44 con SW    0:00 (lpd)               # <- and here, too
   56 p 4 S     0:00 -bash
   47 con S     0:00 /usr/sbin/crond
   57 p 5 S     0:00 /sbin/agetty 38400 tty5
[snip]

Processes 40, 42 and 44 are swapped out.
42 [ inetd ] is in swap because the other system in my 2 boxes mini net
   is off.
44 [ lpd ] is in swap because I have not printed anything since I needed
   real memory for something serious ( viewing dirty pictures with xv ;-) )
40 [ klogd ] is in swap because the kernel didn't want to talk to me
   in the meantime.

As soon as any of these -swapped out- processes gets a "WAKE-UP" by the
kernel they will return into real memory.

For best compression on previously uncompressed files,
which is better: tar * | gzip, or gzip * | tar?
IE, is it best to tar compressed files, or compress
a tar file of uncompressed files?  Does gzip -r * work
better than either solution?

I am not too certain about this but I remember having read somewhere that NFS
is a connectionless protocol and term is only for connection priented

Well, a bit of a brute force method.  But you could try the following:

- Use brk() to obtain the end of the BSS area.  If your pointer is
  below that address, it is valid (except for QMAGIC executables,
  which start at address 0x1000, not 0).

- Write a function, which declares one automatic variable, and returns
  the address of that variable as a void *.  Then compare your pointer
  to that address.  If your pointer is higher than this, and lower than
  0xc0000000, then it is on the stack.
