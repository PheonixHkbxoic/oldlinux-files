Immediately after boot, do swapoff -a to disable swapping. Then delete the swap
partition and recreate it as extended. Then create two logical partitions within- one for swap and one for what else you want it.

Upgrade to Linux-1.1>=49. There was a problem with spaces in MS-DOS-Filenames.
(The Spaces were cut off and random bytes were added).

I don't know why this has worked in 1.0.x and early 1.1.x, but it did so.
(I think the only change was the namecache).

I have Linux running on a Gateway 2000 P5/90 PCI bus machine (90mhz Pentium).
The only problems I've encountered have had little to do with it being
a pentium. My two basic problems have been I have an ATI GX Mach 64 PCI
video board and my IDE hard disk has > 1024 cylinders. The video board
problem is temporarily solved with the *unaccelerated* Mach64 Xserver
on sunsite.unc.edu, and the hard disk problem was solved by reading
all the info on EIDE drives available on sunsite.unc.ede and
tsx-11.mit.edu. Otherwise I've had no problems getting linux up and
running on this beast. I only wish the Xfree folks would hurry up and
get an accelerated Mach64 X server!!! (please, pretty please :-)

Yous houdl both upgrade your net-tools to a release suitable for your
kernel version.

They are available on sunacm.swan.ac.uk, and are called:

net-tools-m.m.nn.tar.gz

Where m.m.nn represents your kernel version. Please choose the version
that is the highest that is not higher than your kernel.

I have a question on the configuration of chooser.
I have an xterminal where a want to have a list of machines I want to login to.
This includes the machine where xdm is running . It is this that gives me
problems. Using CHOOSER BROADCAST in the Xaccess file gives a list of machines
excluding the machine that is used by chooser.
Using CHOOSER machine-a machine-b, in which machine-a is the machine which runs
xdm and chooser I get a localhost entry. When using this entry I get an non
access right error from xdm in its log file.

What is the trick to also get the machine used by the xterminal to run chooser
and xdm?

This seems like a 'no-permission' Problem. Try to find the file 'nntp_access'.
If you don't find create it in /usr/local/lib/news or /usr/lib/news (depends on
your installation).

e.g.: dns.novanet.com both post 
                      ^^^^-- both means xfer/read

Maybe there is a manpage for 'nntp_access' on your system.

Date: Mon, 26 Sep 1994 12:34:49 GMT


Hi Linuxers,

    again and again I see postings about filesystems that are mounted, without
    being clean.

    For those interested in a cookbook-like description and necessary
    binaries to set up a linux-box in such a way that the system knows
    whether the filesystem is clean or not, the following information is
    probably worth reading:


    From our anonymous ftp-site ftp.icce.rug.nl the files
            clean.filesystem
    and
            clean.tar.gz
    can be retrieved from the directory /pub/unix. In the file
    'clean.filesystem' the procedure on how to implement the fs-checking is
    described, in the tar.gz some binaries are included.

    Also, our URL http://www.icce.rug.nl may be interrogated: in the
    documents - our own - softwaredescriptions entry you'll find information
    comparable to the info given in clean.filesystem.

    That's it, I hope it's useful to some of you.
    
    Have a nice day :-)

Subject: SCSI card dilemma
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 1994 12:51:17 GMT

        Hi everyone.  I have "successfully" installed linux on my primary
IDE drive, but have encountered a tiny problem accessing my SCSI drives.  The
partition that I have for linux on my IDE drive is only 60 megs, so I really
can't put too much in there.  I have a 300 meg SCSI drive that is just waiting
to be used but I cannot get to it because of a slight problem that I have
with my SCSI card.

        I was wondering if there were some kind soul out there who may have
the specs for a 1989 Future Domain TMC-845 SCSI controller card.  The real
underlying problem is that I cannot get the card to recognize any interrupts.
I have the feeling that I may have to hardwire something, which is fine, but
I do not know what I would have to do to get the card to recognize interrupt 5.

        The SCSI faq said that the TMC-8xx cards would work on interrupts 3
or 5, but since 3 is being used by my serial devices, 5 is my only alternative.

        Please e-mail any help you can offer me (the SCSI faq only gave jumper
settings for a TMC-880, and I don't have all the pins that it mentioned, so
that was of little use).  I will post only the final results, just in case
there is some other poor soul who is stuck with ancient equipment.
