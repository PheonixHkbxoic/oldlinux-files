'unknown host' sounds like a name server problem.  Is your resolver set
up properly?  Check the file /etc/resolv.conf.

To confirm this, try connecting to the system by specifying it's IP
address instead of it's name.

I don't understand your question at all.
- You have network A with a workstation - (a PC????)
- You want to setup a small linux pc with ethernet card in it ????
- This PC running linux and the other workstation have different IP address

Now is the part that's confusing - "being able to access network A via the 
workstation".  Do you mean can the Linux box access network A through the 
workstation"?.

Yes, just attach your linux box directly to network A. Configure the network 
interface.  That's it.  Your linux box doesn't go through workstation A.

Subject: ftape, Mountain drive, Mach2 controller
Date: 29 Sep 1994 17:19:58 GMT

I have a Mountain 250MB tape drive with a Summit Mach2, high speed compression controller. It uses a normal FDC chipset, but has selectable I/O address, IRQ and DMA channels. This controller, when used with Mountain Filesafe tm. Software, allows me to store 330+ MB on a TD2120 tape and increases DTR from 2MB per min. to 6-8MB per min. Under Dos it also allows formatting on the fly. I know most of this will never work under Linux, but if I could just get the higher DTR Id be happy.

Has anyone else out there tried/been successful in getting ftape to talk to this configuration?

If so, please let me know where I could get an archive of your sorce directory and a mini-howto of how you got things working.

Thanks!

Subject: Window managers
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 09:59:25 GMT

I'm using xdm to boot into Xwindows.  I finally got it so it loads Motif
as the windows manager.  However, if a user wants to user another
manager, they can't.  If they kill the Motifwm process, the system goes
back to the login screen.  You can't simply run another wm, since one's
already running.  If you tell Motif to quit, it does just that, and
you're placed at the login screen again.

I'd like some suggestions on allowing the user to switch managers.
I am already aware that they can edit the $HOME/.Xsession file to set
whichever manager they want.  But, I would like to be able to switch 'on
the fly'.

Thanks.

That's IF (big if) all your VLB slots support 50Mhz, as well as all your VLB
cards.  Most only support up to 40Mhz for two slots, 33Mhz for three.  The
optimal is to overclock a DX2/66 to a DX2/80 (which I do).  This smokes both
and gives optimal VLB performance for my three VLB controllers (all bus-master).
Even if you don't overclock, since the bus speeds are limited to 8Mhz/ISA and
33-40Mhz for VLB (and even 12Mhz for EISA), then the speed of the cpu will not 
affect performance on the bus as much as you think.  A faster interal speed
seems to increase performance for everything.

Set the modem to Auto Answer using DIP switch 5.

After that, read the Serial-HOWTO. There is a section in it just
for you.

Mail me if you can't find the HOWTO and I will send it to you, (its

I have a 1542B and a ProAudioBasic 16 (PAS16 without SCSI) and
had the same Problem. I fixed it by reducing the BUSON-time
and increasuing the BUSOFF time of the 1542B (this was suggested
in the Sound HOWTO). This can e.g. be done in the kernel
in the file drivers/scsi/aha1542.c in the following part:

                    
            /* Set the Bus on/off-times as not to ruin floppy performance */
    {
            unchar oncmd[] = {CMD_BUSON_TIME, 7};
            unchar offcmd[] = {CMD_BUSOFF_TIME, 5};
                    

You have to experiment which values are working well for your system.
The suggested modification will slow down the IO-Performance 
between the 1542B and the system. 

Hope this helps,
Chris

Wondering how you did that. All my dos & os/2 partitions have always

Digiboard will be releasing a Linux driver (1.1.50 kernel) for their PC/Xe
board in about two weeks. I don't know if theirs is 16-port or not. You
probably don't want to run 16 ports without using an intelligent I/O
product such as Digiboards. There is also the Cyclades Cyclom, which is
being advertised in Linux Journal. The driver is on sunsite in pub/Linux
/kernel/misc, I think, with the name cyclad*. I believe they have an 8-port
and 16-port version, and they are co-processed boards.

Not to prolong the war, but suprisingly I DO agree with Mark's basic 
sentiment, even if I suggested he coudl be a little more laid back about it
(the 2001 quote.)

Games are fine, but continual postings all over ALL of the linux groups 
gets to be rather annoying.  It is NOT a development issue, nor is it an 
OS issue (unless someone is plannign on writing a DOOM-kernel;) )

Postings about this or any other game should really be kept in the help, 
misc or game-specific topics.

Nuff said.

        I compiled ncurses 1.8, and it seems to work fine, except

When you do this, the process simply hangs there; you can only
^C it.

        act.sa_handler = cont;
        act.sa_flags = 0;
        sigaction(SIGCONT, &act, &oact);
        sigdelset(&act.sa_mask, SIGCONT);
        creceived = 0;
/* This is the problem */
        while (!creceived)
                {
                sigsuspend(&act.sa_mask);
                }
        sigaction(SIGCONT, &oact, NULL);
}

static void cont(int signo)
{
        creceived = 1;
}

        See the line marked /* This is the problem */?  It gets
to that point and hangs.
        What's going on here?  I can't see why it's not working...
any help appreciated.  Thanks.

If you can get the connect string, what about using "file" on what the
punter's after to see if it's ascii or a zip/whatever? It should be
relatively easy to to make a guesstimate of how long a file will take
to transmit based on the connect string and size/type of file.

I had this same problem, the answer for me was to upgrade ifconfig.
After all, the kernel probe found the currect HWaddr, it only makes sense 
that there is a problem with ifconfig.

BTW, I too was using a NE2000 clone.
