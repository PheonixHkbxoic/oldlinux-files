Subject: Big IDE- fdisk 'different phys/log...'
Date: 9 Oct 1994 19:30:55 GMT

I've been following the discussions of large IDE drives, but am
running into an fdisk message which I haven't seen mentioned.  I'd
like to know if I'm safe ignoring it, or if it means something 
significant.

After trying a number of configurations, I decided to install the
drive (a Western Digital AC2540, 540 Mb) on a second IDE card, so that
I could rule out the possibility of wierd interactions with AT BIOS.  The
drive geometry is hard coded into the kernel (1.1.52 w/ atdisk2-1.1.47+).

After partitioning the drive, fdisk 1.5 reports-

Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/hd1a: 16 heads, 63 sectors, 1048 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 bytes

    Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hd1a1           1       1     246  123983+  83  Linux native
Partition 1 does not start on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(0, 0, 2) should be (0, 1, 1)
/dev/hd1a2         247     247     285   19656   83  Linux native
/dev/hd1a3         286     286     895  307440   83  Linux native
/dev/hd1a4         896     896    1048   77112   83  Linux native
Partition 4 has different physical/logical endings:
     phys=(1023, 15, 63) logical=(1047, 15, 63)


Is the message about different physical/logical endings significant?  The
logical information is correct.  I don't know where the physical information
is coming from.

In the words of an infamous operating system- abort, retry, or ignore?

Hello,

I figure out a way to make openwin/olvwm work under XFree86-3.1.  Here is a
ps -aux, just to prove you it is working...

Now, to make this work, I changed the 'openwin' script in the /usr/openwin/bin
Here is the new script (name it openwin3.1):

=-======================That's it.

Now, let me tell you that in the Virtual Desktop manager, the horizontal line
is missing...??? Would someone else know why?

And, your "Workspace" need to be edited also.  Otherwise, you will run 'old'
binaries.  I did not change this 'yet' and I will not have the time until
maybe tonight or tomorrow.  I will post it here when I change it.

Now just type: openwin3.1 (don't forget to put chmod 755 openwin3.1).

has I said, when I'll have the time to modify the Workspace mouse-menu, I will
post it here.

Subject: Re: shutdown without root access  --  SUMMARY
Date: 9 Oct 1994 19:50:26 GMT

A few days ago I posted this note:

> I am trying to set up my system so that others in my family can start
> and stop it without root privileges.  

Thanks to all the respondents!  I will summarize the ideas, starting with
the simpler ones and proceeding to the more elaborate.

Greck Cannon <greck@scaredy.catt.ncsu.edu> suggests:
> Make a group containing the people you want to be able to shut the
> machine down.  Then change /sbin/shutdown to suid [change its owner to
> root,] and change its group to the shutdown people group.  You may also
> have to suid and chgrp halt and reboot...

> The shutdown, halt, etc users aren't really for manual use.

Tony Peterman <automata@netcom.com> suggested changing the login shell
to "shutdown -r now".  (Unfortunately my version of login apparently
doesn't allow the login shell to have command line arguments.)  He also
cautions "make sure the login dir is /, or you might have to fsck
filesystems on reboot".

Andrew R. Tefft <teffta@crypt.erie.ge.com> thinks my scheme for linking
control-alt-del to shutdown is safe, but:

> I prefer logging in as shutdown because you can assign a password to
> that account. On the other hand, the CAD [cntl-alt-del] can only be
> done at the console, while if you were on the network, anyone could
> login as shutdown (if they knew the password, if any).

He also suggests that users "sync" and "halt" should be used only in
emergencies, and that user "shutdown" needs a script wrapper:

>> Can you really run shutdown as a login shell?

> Yes.  BUT.  many 'login's cannot take options to the login shell.
> You may have to actually have it run a script 'doshutdown' which calls
> shutdown with the proper arguments. Your version of /sbin/shutdown
> apparently needs arguments.

Peter <PSA@thor.lfs.hamburg.cap-debis.de> allows users to reboot from
the login prompt by defining a user "reboot" with no password, UID and
GID of 0, login shell of bash, and a startup file ~reboot/.bash_profile
containing the command "/sbin/reboot".  He cautions that passwd(1)
considers root and reboot to be the same user: 

> after changing root's password vi [edit] /etc/passwd and remove
> reboot's password, cause it's changed to root's also!

Marc Heinzmann <heinzman@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.DE> posted source code
for a program shudown.login which gives a regular user the privilege of
shutting the system down.  The authorization is based on a UID which
is defined in the source code.

Lars Hofhansl <lars@hboix1> offered a more general program:
> I have written a small program which ... gives ordinary users
> limited root access.  It reads a configuration file which
> contains a list of users and the commands they are allowed to
> use, and a flag that (if set) requires the user to enter the
> password again on each invokation.  Every command execution is
> logged to the syslog daemon.

> I called it "priv". So to shut down I simply type "priv shutdown
> -h now".  This also reduces the need to log in as root over and
> over again.

Lars, Robert Moser <araw@iplab.health.ufl.edu> and Randy Hootman
<rph@netcom.com> also suggested the even more general program sudo(8)
which is in the Slackware distribution.  Quoting from its manual page:

       Sudo  allows  a permitted user to execute a command as the
       superuser.  Sudo determines who is an authorized  user  by
       consulting  the file /etc/sudoers.  Sudo will prompt for a
       user's password to initiate a validation period of N  min-
       utes (where N is defined at installation time and defaults
       to 5 minutes).
 
Privileges can be restricted based on username, command, and/or host.

Thanks again to everyone!

Well, I guess I was a bit unclear...I don't care as much as posting the fix
as posting the bug itself (with or without the fix).  The smail bug was
known on various platforms besides Linux, but since it relies on the user
having an account on the machine in question, it wasn't as big an issue
as it could have been.

All the attempts to hack my machine originated from a remote machine, in
fact a single user workstation which has only one account besides root
on it, who was in addition an employee of thenearby University.  There was
also the usual attempts to try and hack the ftp, nntp, rsh and rexec
systems, and a quick identity trap easily tracjed the culprit down.

At this time I'm undecided as to what action to take since this person
isn't a student but a full time employee of the school.

Since my system does run in a commercial enviroment (well, non-profit,
so things aren't quite as sensitve)  All users are well aware of security,
and I also keep a tight handle on any networking access.  Of course
mail is something which you pretty much have to have free access to.

If someone just wants to mention there was a security hole, in lets say
inetd, and just post the fix, thats fine with me.  Yes, people in the know 
will see the fix and be able to figure out what the hole is, but at least
its a shade more secure than posting step by step instructions on how
to actually exploit the hole.

What is wrong with a little discretion about security issues?
Some people are way too busy to scan all the linux groups every 
day to look for security holes.  Maybe someday somebody will
start a linux-security mailing list that would inform ppl of
vulnerabilities and fixes, so at least one could be warned.

If there was a security developers group, then the holes could
be emailed to them for evaluation so as not to publicize the hole
long before the fix.  Or make a moderated comp.os.linux.security
group?

Just a few thoughts for discussion...

fputs(line) would not normally be expected to return the number
of characters in the line. The following is an exerpt from "man fputs"
on my Linux machine:

RETURN VALUES
       fputc(), putc() and putchar() return the character written
       as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF on error.

       puts() and fputs() return a non - negative number on  suc-
       cess, or EOF on error.

The following is quoted from "C: A Reference Manual" by Harbison & Steele.

" ... (A typical implementation of 'fputs' actually does use 'fputc'
  to write out the characters of the string, and returns whatever
  value is returned by the last call to 'fputc'. Unfortunately, if
  the string is empty, no call is made to 'fputc' and that implementation
  of 'fputs' will return an unpredictable result ... ) "

I haven't managed to track down how GCC implements fputs (it's butried
a lot deeper than /usr/include/stdio.h); maybe someone who knows would
be good enough to tell us ... ?

Meanwhile, it wouild appear that the bug which Tim Bass has astutely
corrected is an instance of somewhat rash programming.
