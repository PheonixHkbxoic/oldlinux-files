Although I understand your frustrations, I think people SHOULD post detailed
information about wholes that exist. I don't know if you remember, but the
"worm" incident on the internet on the 80's got worse than it should have been
because key usenet/email nodes decided the best way to defeat it was to
disconnect themselves from the net. But they didn't realize that this also
prevented them from receiving very important informations about the worm. The
pointer here is that, yes there will always be these loosers who with malice
try to break into other people's machines, but the best way, as far as I know,
is to educate people about why and what is wrong with the security system, not
just provide ambiguous patches. Things like COPS or any network tracers can be
very dangerous in the hands of the wrong people, but that doesn't mean that
we should eliminate them.

Reply-To: KROCULICK@bng.ge.com

Recently, I've noticed an increase in postings where the
authors e-mail address is showing up as:

        (some name) @myhost.subdomain.domain

or other non-legal Internet addresses.  Could you please fix
this problem as soon as possible?  If you are able to post 
messages, you must have some type of valid address, whether it
passes through a gateway or not.  I'm sure that this is an 
oversight by some new sysadmin, and not an attempt at deceit.

There was a bit of a controversy a few months ago, when America
On-Line added Internet access to its service.  The Internet 
old-timers were upset because thousands of people who were naive
in the ways of nettiquette began to flood the Internet.  With 
competition between Internet service providers lowering prices,
and Linux having stable TCP/IP code, many Linux users are putting
their boxes on the Internet.  We must remember to act responsibly
with our machines, because now, instead of practicing poor 
nettiquette, we have root privledges, and we could cause some 
problems.

SUMMARY:  If you're on the net, act responsibly.  If you're
           clueless, don't put your machine on the net - pay to
           be a user on someone else's machine.

Date: 11 Oct 1994 03:37:23 GMT

I like what I have seen of Linux so far and would like to try it on the side. 
Can I install it in some empty space set aside at the end of my drive? Can I use Bootman (os/ two) sorry, no number keys running) and boot into linux. I would just use my dos fat and os-too partitions mounted in the normal way. If it is set as a bootable partition, but not the primary one will it work or just be 
confused?

Sounds like you need more RAM.  I have run Linux on a bunch of
different machines from a a 20 Mhz. 386 to a 90 Mhz. Pentium.  They
all seem to run much faster with at least 16M of RAM.

Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 13:54:14 GMT

I just installed the latest release of Slackware (2.0.1 I think) and am
having problems with LateX/TeX. In particular dvips. First time through
I only installed what I needed. I re-installed again this time installing
everything (to play it safe). 
Basicall, it looks like dvips is not finding any fonts and when it
run Make...PK it fails on every font.

I thought I would ask first before I go throught the hassle of starting
from scratch and installing myself.  All the fonts seem to be in place
and latex has no problems assemling my document.

And you have to do it after every time the printer gets a software reset.
A bit tricky if you want to have the same printer configuration work for
DOS and Linux at the same time.  I have a set of configuration switches on
my DJ550C that can select the CR/LF interpretation at reset time.  I leave
it in DOS mode, then I send a reset string during system startup, and I
modified the output filter that LPR uses to send the same string after it
decides to do a reset (like after sending a postscript file, before it returns
to text mode).  Does the LJ printer also have these configuration switches?
If you only run under Linux, you can configure the printer for Linux and
not worry about it anymore.  If you want Linux and DOS to share, then
you need a more complicated solution.

Just buy one 'o those small 1-2 cubic foot refrigerators and modify it
into a PC enclosure.  That way, your WHOLE machine runs cooler, and you
have someplace for beer besides.......


This is only half a joke, BTW - I actually considered doing this to try
to get my (Intel) DX2-66 to run at 100 MHz.  It runs fine at 80; when I
try to speed it up more the external cache fails.  Chips run faster at
the cooler end of their environmental range, by a factor of 20% or more.

Another way to speed things up is to crank the voltage up a bit.  5V chips
often work fine up past 7V; works fine in the lab, though I'm hesitant to
do it to my machine at home.  Heat becomes an even worse problem as well.

(I know the above from job-related testing of standard commercial devices
in liquid nitrogen.  At -200 C we would routinely get a 2X improvement in
device speed.)


PS: Ran some benchmarks on my nominally 80 MHz machine; I saw only a 6%
speedup in CPU-intensive tasks.  This implies that I'm RAM limited, not
CPU limited.  BUT my video performance went up 16%; I suspect because my
VLB is running at the new bus rate.

HI,

OK... here is the question!

I don't seem to have a "network node hostname"
ie.  if I enter the "uname -a " command  I get

        Linux (none) 1.0 #2 Sat Apr 2 03:15:37 CST 1994 i386

BTW , WHAT Version of Linux am I on?  I don't seem to be able to 
tell iff I am using the Slackware 2.0 or not.

So right now my "network node hostname is (none).

This is different from /etc/HOSTNAME which I have set to 'home.calleson.com'
and it is also in my /etc/hosts file.

Someone mentioned that there were two different versions of hostname/domainname
that are installed with Slackware 1.0 and Slackware 2.0...
Can someone who knows what is going on please expound on this?

Thanks

The reason I need to have a network node hostname is so I can 
run slip !  right now everytime I enter the DIP command I get
the response '(none): host name lookup failure


THANKS FOR ANY AND ALL HELP!

Sure,  you need to create the file /usr/local/lib/news/nntp_access.
You might need to make the /usr/local/lib/news directory first, too.
To allow access from your local host, you might have a nntp_access
file like this:

localhost read post

I think if you try a man nntpd, you'll probably get information on
this file format...
