That was the reason for the suspicion, no sources, never referred to

I can support these statements; in trying to avoid just that, a
"character assassination" on hearsay, I specifically did not mention
a name, but asked the emailer of these statements to follow up on my
posting as soon as possible and to elaborate his first hand
experiences, to which he agreed.  He emailed me back that he had in
fact posted that followup, but I have not seen it in any of the
threads, including this one.

Btw, stating someone asked for an account, for the password file, or
is bragging about violating computer security can hardly be called an
attempt at character assassination - as you appear to admit yourself;
they may be, however, relevant facts to the issue. I had no reason to
doubt that what the emailer said had in fact happened to him.

I'm not sure now if I should reveal the emailer's name.  I hope he
would speak up. I will not disclose his email to me here in public,
but will send it to Mohan Kokal.
Anyway, given these statements, I felt it warranted a warning about
the shadow-mk package; I was not alone in this.

If, in fact, my remarks are interpreted by you and others to be an
unfounded "character assassination", I apologize to Mohan Kokal.

Bull. This is quite common for "fake" users, who have a a program installed
as a shell which is not so very shell-like.

Examples: uucp (sometimes), halt, sync ...
Very common: to halt the system from the login prompt, you just log in as
halt.

Subject: warm reboot w/ ethernet card troubles...
Date: 8 Sep 1994 14:21:23 -0400

I recently installed a d-link D200 ethernet card (an NE*000 clone)
in my box and I've been having troubles with warm boots ever since.  
If I reboot using shutdown -r it hangs right after configuring plip 
(i.e. at the probe for ethernet cards), same if I use the reset 
button from any of the 'safe' places.  I do not have any problem 
with cold boots.
Does anybody know of any way to fix this *without* recompiling the
kernel?  The card is at 0x300, irq 11.  I'm not real happy about leaving
my box in state where it can't bring itself up after a reboot...

Thanks,

townsend

http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/misc/multicard.html

I've included it here:

<html>
<title>Multiple Linux ethercard HowTo</title>
<h1><a name="top">Mini-HowTo on using multiple ethercards with Linux</h1>
<body>

<P>This is an short note on configuring  Linux to recognize multiple ethernet
adapters. 

<P>For most people running a standard Linux distribution, just add this
line to the top of your <i>/etc/lilo.conf</i> file and re-run `lilo': 

<listing>
append = "ether=0,0,eth1"
</listing>

<P>That's all there is to it.  The next time you boot Linux should
recognize your second ethercard.

<h2>What you did, and how you did it.</h2>

<P>By default a stock Linux kernel probes for a single ethercard, and once
one is found the probe ceases.  There are three defined ways to cause the
kernel to probe for additional cards.  In increasing order of difficulty and
permanence they are:

<ul>
<li>Passing parameters to your kernel at boot time.
<li>Configuring your boot loader to always pass those parameters.
<li>Modifying the kernel netcard probe tables in <b>drivers/net/Space.c</b>.
</ul>

<P>For most people the second method is most appropriate, and it's the
one that was described above.

<h2>Passing parameters using your boot loader</h2>

<P>In the following instructions it's assumed that you are using the standard
Linux boot loader, `<i>LILO</i>'.

<P>The Linux kernel recognizes certain parameters passed at boot-time.  Most
often these parameters specify aspects of the configuration that cannot be
determined at boot-time.  For network adaptors the following parameter is
recognized: 
<listing>
ether=<IRQ>,<IO-ADDR>,<PARAM1>,<PARAM2>,<NAME>
</listing>

Valid numeric arguments may be in decimal, octal (with a leading '0')
or hexadecimal (preceded by a '0x').  The first non-numeric argument
is taken to be the <i>NAME</i> of the device.  Empty arguments are
taken to be zero, and any omitted arguments before the name are left
unchanged.
<dl>
<dt>IRQ
<dd>This entry specifies the IRQ value to be set (on boards with
software-settable IRQs) or used (on boards with jumpered IRQs).  A
value of '0' means to read the IRQ line from the board (if possible)
or use autoIRQ if the board doesn't provide a way to read the IRQ.
<dt>IO-ADDR
<dd>This entry specifies a single base I/O address to probe.
A value of zero specifies that all reasonable I/O address are to be probed.

<P>Normally an I/O region reservation map is used to decide if a
location can be probed.  This map is ignored if an I/O address is specified.
This allows the "reserve=<IO-ADDR>,<EXTENT>" parameter to exclude
other device probes from an IO region. 

<dt>PARAM1,PARAM2
<dd>Originally these entries were for specifying the memory address of
adaptors that use shared memory, like the WD8013.  Over time they have
been extended to provide other driver-specific information.

<dt>NAME
<dd>The name of a predefined device.  The stock kernel defines at
least "eth0", "eth1", "eth2", and "eth3".  Other devices names (e.g.
for PPP, SLIP, or a pocket ethernet device) may exist but will have
different semantics.

</dl>

<P>LILO provides two ways to pass these boot-time parameters to the kernel.
The most common way to do this is to type them immediately after specifying
the name of the boot image.  The following example enables all four of the
available probe slots.
<listing>
linux ether=0,0,eth1 ether=0,0,eth2 ether=0,0,eth3
</listing>

<P>Of course this is pretty complicated to type in at each boot, and
would preclude unattended reboots.  You can make the kernel parameters
permanent by adding an "append" line to your LILO configuration file,
<i>/etc/lilo.conf</i>, and running LILO to install your updated configuration.
<listing>
append = "ether=0,0,eth1 ether=0,0,eth2 ether=0,0,eth3"
</listing>


<h2>Modifying your kernel</h2>

<P>If it's possible for you to configure your system without modifying
the kernel source, I recommend that you do so.  Modifying the source
code isn't self-documenting and results in extra complications at
upgrade time.  Still there are a few instances where it is
appropriate:

<ul>
<li>When you need to enable more than four devices.  (The
drivers/net/Space.c only has entries for eth0...eth3.)
<li>When you must limit the probe types to a subset of possible card types
e.g. when a probe confuses a different type of device.
<li>When you want a device name other than eth<i>N</i>.
</ul>

If you've decided to go this route, edit the device list in
drivers/net/Space.c to insert your desired values.  If you need to add
a new device take care that you preserve the chaining: use the
existing list entries as a guide.

<h2><a name="cardnotes">Special notes on the specific device probes</h2>

<h3>The 3c509 in ISA mode</h3>

<P>The 3c509 has a unique feature that allows truly safe probing on the
ISA bus.  This is great, but unfortunately for us this method doesn't
mix well with the rest of the probes.

<P>The most noticeable aspect is that it's difficult to predict
<i>a priori</i> which card will be accepted "first" -- the order is based
on the hardware ethernet address.  That means that the ethercard with the
lowest ethernet address will be assigned to "eth0", and the next to "eth1",
etc.  If the "eth0" ethercard is removed, they all shift down one number.

<P>A related aspect is that it's not possible to leave an "earlier"
card disabled, enable a card at an address or IRQ different than the
EEPROM setting, or enable a card at a specific address. 

<h3>The EISA 3c579 and the 3c509 in EISA mode</h3>

Kernels before 1.1.25 will not correctly probe for multiple EISA-mode cards.
If multiple "ethN" entries are specified the *same* 3c5*9 card will be
found multiple times.
The work-around is to specify the slot-based I/O address explicitly.

Kernels after 1.1.25 will correctly find multiple EISA-mode cards, and
will continue to find additional ISA-mode adaptors after all of the
potential EISA-mode addresses are checked.

If you have LILO on the Master Boot Record of your first hard drive
/dev/hda you can remove it by booting DOS and running "fdisk /mbr".
This restores the MBR on the drive, but this may be a DOS 6.0 specific
option, I can't quite remember.  You may want to check it out before
going in boots n' all.

However make sure you have both a bootable DOS floppy and a bootable
Linux floppy handy, in particular the Linux floppy as you will have no
way of booting your linux partition.

Cheers,

Thank you all very much for your help in fixing this e2fsck problem!
The problem was really that I used it on a mounted filesystem.

And please excuse my hard words about Linux in my first post, but
I was too angry this morning. I was at the same stage as 3 month ago!
Your help was really great and I withdraw everything I said about Linux

But there is still a advantage of it: The feedback was much better

Do you get the 'staircase'-effect, where following line starts right below
the end of the previous line?  No need to fiddle with tftp and so on!

Simply make a second entry in your printcap with a different
printername and the line :rp=text: instead of :rp=raw:. I use another
queue-directory as well, but don't think that this is mandatory.
Your JetDirect manual should have a chapter "configuring for lpd",
where you will find more details.

I have 8Mb RAM, 8Mb Swap, and actually 9 Xterm's on the screen.
(well, not really xterm, rxvt to be honest).

Verify that your swap is used; you must have somewhere in an "rc"
file something like "swapon /dev/swap-partition", or "swapon -a",
in this case  the partition must be declared in /etc/fstab, for
exemple:
 
# device        directory       type    options        
/dev/hda2       none            swap    swap
