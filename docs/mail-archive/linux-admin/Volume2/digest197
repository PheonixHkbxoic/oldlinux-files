Same here, also if you've used the floppy before ftape.. then ftape 
refuses to work, basically the kernel doesn't release the floppy after 
umount (or so I believe) thought there was a patch or something but 
haven't come across it. Also the floppy_hack option in ftape causes it to 
hang on use with my system (1.1.53).

The lbx stuff is still in early development. I tried it and couldn't
tell much difference, and it crashed my X server once. There has also
for a while been sxpc which does pretty much the same thing, only it
doesn't need any bits compiled into the X server, and does not require
the X11R6 server.

Display postscript is a proprietary extension in X available to Sun's/Solaris
X11 servers only. This mean you can't view the likes of answerbook/sunsolve 
eaisly. However if you have a older version of sunsolve/answerbook you can use 
the perl script "xdocviewer" available on most X archives which just uses 
ghostview as a front end for displaying those postscript pages. Alternatively
if you have a more recent answerbook/sunsolve version, there is a Viewer option
on the Properties menu which lets you select ghostview as the postscript viewer.
Obviously you must have ghostview installed on the Sun also.

Works for me.

The info is just left lying around in /etc/utmp, which is why finger catches

(took me a while to track it down as a /bin/login problem...)

The real problem is that different people have different ideas on how utmp
should work.  BSD says one way.  SYSV says another, and linux is somewhere
in the middle. 

If you are running an early version of linux, you could try upgrading.

I hate to followup myself, but I found that getty_ps-2.0.7e solves
the problem by denying login names starting with a '-'.

Well, one reason to do this is to save the batteries in a laptop,

I'd like to know specifically where you added the delay. One user reported that
changing all of the calls of outw() to outw_p() [which adds a small delay] fixed
his problem. I tried that, but it didn't work for me. I ended up switching to
a NE2000 clone board and all works fine now.

I've recenltly installed shadow on my system and have managed to
fix most of the programs for shadow.
Ie login, ftp, pop but now I need a fix for rexecd.
I got the sources for rexecd and recompiled with -lshadow but it

As soon as I put an encripted passwd in the passwd file it works again.

Can any one help.
Is there a full list of standard progs that need to be recompiled for shadow

I've done this before:

I order to use the Netware print queues you need to have NFS for Ntware 
installed.


You then set up your /etc/printcap for remote printers and define them
as the queues on the NW server.  Set upi the filters.



Everything sould be fine.

Good Luck

Subject: Problem Running rcp.rstatd from rc.inet2
Date: 14 Oct 1994 13:16:35 -0500

I posted this to comp.os.linux.help and didn't get a response, so I
thought I'd try here.

I'm running the slackware 1.0.9 distribution.

I added code to my rc.inet2 to run rpc.rstatd in the last section with
runs various daemons needing portmap.  I had run rpc.rstatd from a
virtual console and got the perf meter to display the data, so I
rebooted Linux and my system stopped processing the scripts and inittab
entries after it started rpc.rstatd.  I had no virtual consoles and the
main console was locked up and I do not know how to terminate the
running script on the main console. I thought I had not put an & after
it and thought that was the problem, but none of the other processes
use an &.  

I reinstalled the network disks from the slackware distribution to
overwrite the rc.inet2 and was able to start up my system.  I've looked
in the man pages that have anything to do with RPC or rstat and I've
come up dry about how to keep this from happening again.

Did I missing something in the documents or what?

Hi all,

I am a fairly novice linux user, and am running into a problem.

I am running linux on a 486/40 with 8 megs of ram.  Upon boot up this 
morning, Immediately after running the multiprocess routines, and before 
login, a message stating something such as:

Process C3 was out of sync,  not running for 5 minutes.

The system was hung, and I didn't wait for 5 minutes, I just 
rebooted.(reset button).  

Now, whenever I try to boot linux, after the hard drive is mounted, it 
hangs eternally with no error message.  

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to remedy this situation 
without starting over from scratch?  I've got a few hours into the setup 
and xconfig and such, and I haven't got a backup.

Thanks,

Jake Sanderson

Patrick,

please have a look at the maintenance scripts from BSD. I have installed them
on our Slackware Installations and they spare me a lot of work...

Also there are some minor bugs:

- the installation script defines gr*.map to be a german keytable, while
  the installed package has them renamed to de*.map

- The installation script should recognize if the user does not define
  a /var partition. Then it should offer to possibilites:
    a) install /var stuff on root partition (useful for CD-ROM mounted /usr)
    b) make /var a symlink to /usr and install those things to /usr.

- in.rwalld is missing from rc.inet2.

- netconfig should ask for more than one name server. Also if yp is installed,
  it should be configured as well.

Also i would suggest that you have a look at the netstart script of BSD
it shows nicely how to configure networking without having to uncomment
whole passages of the script.

Also you carry some obsolete binaries around, like ifsetup/iflink.
I would also suggest that you include dosfsck and mkdosfs in the distribution,
those would fit nicely into the fdisk.*/mkfs.* scheme.

I have a list of other things somewhere near my computer, when i find it, i
will send it to you :)

Keep on going

I am running slackware 1.2 with kernel 1.1.49.
smail version 3.1.28.1 
(yes I know of the security bug).

Basically what I want to do is the following :

If I receive mail at my domain for a user who is not defined,
I need to forward that mail to postmaster.

The man page indicates that the entry

default_user = postmaster

be inserted in the directors file. However, when I used this
entry , smail gives me an error.

I tried the smart_user entry in the config file but this did not
help.

Essentially, I do not want mail from outside my domain to bounce
with an UNKNOWN-USER error message. I would like to intercept these
messages and have them sent to the postmaster.

Can smail do this ?
