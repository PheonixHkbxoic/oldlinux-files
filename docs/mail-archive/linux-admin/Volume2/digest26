I had a similar problem with the DEPCA driver in some 1.1.1x or 2x
version of the kernel, now it's fixed, but what I did that time was to
hard code the IRQ value in the Space.c file in ~linux/drivers/net.

Better still, try killall.  It's in the latest procps suite and does
exactly what you want.

Subject: ALEX, AFS on Linux? [Was: Is it possible to have NFS via TERM]
Date: 05 Sep 1994 18:17:29 GMT


I recall some references to ALEX, some ftp-based filesystem.
I asked archie, and came up empty. I can't find any more
info on the ALEX filesystem. Anybody out there wanna send
me some pointers?

By the way... has anybody tried AFS on Linux? I'm curious
to know what folks' experiences were.

[AFS has the advantage of replicated fileservers... plus,
I think you could use it's local write-back cache as a way
to use the files while you're not connected to the server...
then when you reestablish the network link, AFS would go
like crazy updating all the files. Fantasy mabye? ]

   That was true with term 1.X versions.  Term 2.X supports
   connectionless protocals.  However, NFS requires binding
   to a port < 1024 on a machine that is connected with a
   networking protocal supported by the kerenel.  So for right
   now, NFS still won't work over term.

I just compiled the shadow package from sunsite.  (3.3.2 maybe?) 
The file config.h is what you want to edit;  it has a define
to allow DOUBLE_LENGTH_PW or something like that.

Subject: How to set up a Linux PC as an X-terminal
Reply-To: hm@ix.de
Date: Mon, 5 Sep 1994 17:15:33 GMT

It may have been mentioned here already. I didn't find it in one of the
HOWTOs (although this would fit into the Installation-HOWTO or the 
XFree86-HOWTO). I apologize if you find this is not the right group for 
that.

To setup a Linux PC as an X-terminal, you simply have to call the 
X server with the option "-indirect <hostname>" to get a chooser 
and "-query <hostname>" to get an xdm login from that host. I added
those options to the xinit call in startx which is probably not the 
right place but at least something to start with. 

Does anyone have a complete Xterminal setup, i.e. boot the PC and
get the chooser/xdm login? Omitting all stuff that is not needed?

I know that there is a software named "Peek & Spy" from Networking

but then was adapted for Unix, Software makes a spy over any tty,
