Subject: An idea for running dos
Date: 2 Sep 1994 22:38:22 GMT



In an Ideal world some one would write a dos/windows emulator
for linux but I have a simpler idea.

Most people who want a dos emulator have at least a partition with dos
on it, a partition with linux and a swap partition.

What if two commands could be add to the kernel: 

save_stop which put ever process into the swap,
          saved its internal state, the screen etc..

resume (a boot option) which would load its internal stat
       from the swap and resume the processs.


Then a program could be written whic save/stoped unix and ran dos.
Is this possible?

You can get 0.53 from tsx-11.  It's in a directory 
pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/private/devel.  Everything in private is hidden so you 
have to jump over it ( i.e cd ALPHA/dosemu/private/devel instead of cd private 
ls).  Once you get to devel you can ftp the file.  I don't know what the delay 
in releasing it is.  It seems fairly stable and functional to me.

On the same subject does anyone know where there is some documentation on 
pdipx.  I couldn't get it to work (at least netx failed to find a server and I 
assume that's because pdipx failed).  I couldn't find any information about 
command line parameters or troubleshooting.

Subject: another /usr howto?
Date: 2 Sep 1994 21:44:04 -0400

I have my 1st disk with a minimal linux on one of its partitions.  I have
a 2nd disk with LOTS of disk space on it and I would like to have it come
up as /usr.

I would like to mount this 2nd disk as /usr and install all kinds of stuff
on it.  Then use it as the /usr instead of the minimal one on the 1st
disk.

How do I do it?

Here is what I think ought to be done, but I need some good advice to make
sure this will work:

1.  create the minimal /usr on the 2nd disk
     a.  mount 2nd disk on /mnt
     b.  cd /usr
     c.  cp -Rd /mnt
     d.  edit /etc/fstab and add the following line after the root
partition
          /dev/sda1 /usr ext2 defaults
     e.  reboot to make 2nd /usr happen

2.  install all my other packages.

Is the above how I would do it?  Any snags on the above?

We have a machine with an Intel EtherExpress at the university.
I took a 1.1.24 kernel, enabled ALPHA drivers and the EtherExpress
driver and tried to install Slackware 2.0 via NFS. The reason this did
not work right away was a lack of knowledge about IP, ifconfig, route
etc on my behalf. Sitting down with the Network Administrators Guide
1.0 (this is a must have) solved every problem.

I don't think it is like that...
The task cannot be killed because it is hanging in a device driver.  However,
device drivers should never hang.  When the disk is corrupted, the read
or write should return with an errorcode.  It is the responsability
of the filesystem code to make sure that the filesystem is not further
corrupted.  (e.g. by setting the disk to read-only)

Most likely some mistake in the configuration of networking, and/or a
mismatch between the kernel version and the version of the networking
utilities.

Hi,

        I am still stuck since a week with a network problem and I pull my hairs
off (and eat my nails also). Please help !!!!!!!!

        I was running slackware 1.2 without problem for a while and upgraded
my system WITH THE ORIGINAL/FULL DISTRIBUTION from sunsite.unc.edu. Since, I
can't anymore boot my new kernel with my 3C503 card.

        I get this #$&#*$&!   SIOCADDRT Invalid Argument ass soon as I try to
access it.

o I have tried to install NetKit A and B and noticed that ifconfig
  returns something like

        IRQ=0 and BaseAddr=0.

        Also HWaddr=00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00

o What is REALLY wired is that the kernel boot and probe the card 
  correctely

        3C503 probe at 0x2e0: not found
        3C503 probe at 0x310: 02 60 8c 8d cb 6e
        eth0: 3C503 with shared memory at 0xdc000-0xddfff       

        What does it mean ??? I am not a linux newbie and installed
successfully many systems (SLS and Slackware) without any kind of problem.

        I don't believe there is an IRQ conflict somewhere (I have check the
BIOS also) and IT WAS WORKING BEFORE.


I have:
        o make config
          with correct setup
        o edit ./drivers/net/CONFIG
        o make zImage.


        Note that it does THE SAME THING if I replace my 3c503 with a 3c509.


        ARGGHHHH !!!! Please help me so I will not return to Slackware 1.2.

If you have the newer DOS client software for Netware, it is better
to use it instead of PDIPX.  Get PDETHER 1.3 from the Novell site, and
create a NET.CFG file as documented in its docs.
Then start the networking like this:

        cd \nwclient
        lh lsl
        lh pdether
        lh ipxodi
        lh vlm

When your network is using 802.3 instead of Ethernet-II (the latter is
preferred but the former is still de default provided by Novell, unfortunately)
include the following in dosemu.conf:

        pktdriver novell_hack


All the above assumes you are using the packetdriver method of accessing
the network.  So you can have "ipxsupport off" in dosemu.conf, and you
don't need to include IPX in the kernel.

Actually I'd recommend getting it from:

    ftp.uwa.edu.au                    /pub/nn/beta/nn-6.5.0.b3.tar.gz

Kim Storm no longer maintains nn and the version that most places have
is still 6.4.18. This newer nn is much nicer I have found as it
supports NOV so you don't have to run all the extra database programs
with nn. I had very little problems compiling nn-6.5.0 on Linux, but
you will have to make your own s-linux.h file. If the other site uses
NOV then you will get to see NN speed along over the nntp connection.

I tried the redirection thing (and yes I do know what the proc fs is)
and it did set the kcore size to zero.

Question: Since the file is marked as readonly, shouldn't the redirection
return some sort of error? If I create a normal file with 400 perm's
and try re-directing over it I get 'Persmission denied'. Also I can't
think of any reason why the size should be reset to zero.

P.S. trying to do this sort of stuff to a /proc file is silly, however
maybe this has uncovered a bug/feature in the /proc filesystem.

Catchya round, like a dohnut.

Or even better yet, check out the following package. Be sure to check

=================
                                        
APSFILTER is a lineprinter input filter for systems with a BSD alike
printing mechanism (lpd, /etc/printcap), that saves users a lot of work 
when printing different file types no matter if compressed or not !!!

Additionally it enables non Postscript printers, that are supported
by the public domain postscript emulator "ghostscript" (gs), to
print postscript files !

You bet they are broken. They are the same program and it's suppose to

Add you're host name to the above mentioned file as step 1.

Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.M and look for the lines that mention hostname and
domain name. Remove all references to domainname from this file as
step 2. Change the hostname line to say:
        /bin/hostname -F /etc/HOSTNAME
or if that doesn't work use this:
        /bin/hostname `cat /etc/HOSTNAME`
Also the line that says /bin/hostname_notcp you can change to:
        /bin/hostname_notcp `cat /etc/HOSTNAME`

Also make sure that all files in /etc/rc.d have execute persmission.
Then edit /etc/resolv.conf and set your domain name in this file.

If you don't run named (or use an named on another machine) then remove
the 'nameserver' line from /etc/resolv.conf. Also edit /etc/host.conf and
change the first line to 'order hosts, bind'. Then add your host to
/etc/hosts and this should complete the setup.

Now you should be able to type hostname and get your correct name, also
hostname -f should give the FQDN and hostname -d the domainname. And if
I were you get the net-tools package and hack hostname.c to work
properly when called domainname.
