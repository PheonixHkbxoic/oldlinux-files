   THEREF(tm) is a comprehensive Directory of Hard Drives, Floppy Drives,
Optical Drives, and Drive Controllers & Host Adapters.  It is designed to
help the novice and pro alike with integration problems and system setups.
   Information is provided in two handy formats; Portrait mode, for those
who prefer a normal book-binding type print format, and(or) do not have a
printer with Landscape capability.  And Landscape mode, for those who pre-
fer a computer-printout type format.
   For printing, a Laserjet is preferred, but not necessary, and setup
info is provided.  For viewing, LIST(tm) by Vernon Buerg, will provide an
excellent result, and allow text searches for finding specific models.


REVISION HISTORY
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

VERSION 1.00   This version was a preliminary attempt to start to compile
(early '89)    a list of drives in ASCII.  It was intended for in-house
               use only, not released publicly. 

VERSION 2.00   Decided to use File Express(tm) as the database of choice
(mid '89)      for building a listing of drives and controllers.  Used
               portrait mode for all specs.  Still an in-house publication.
               
VERSION 3.00   Changed to Landscape mode for the Drives List.  Stayed with
11-21-89       portrait mode for controllers.  First distribution to close
               friends.  Listed 431 drives and 134 controllers.
               
VERSION 3.10   Not released.  

VERSION 3.20   First official public release on BBSs.   Went to landscape 
04-01-90       mode for both listings.  Listed 973 drives and 231 control-
               lers.

VERSION 4.00   This major release was formatted to support Laserjet type
07-25-90       printers, for maximum impact and clarity.  Portrait and
               Landscape of printing were included for each file.  The file
               "Diagrams.Doc" was started after the initial release, but 
               found it's way public, and so was released as an unfinished,
               "running" document with all future releases of THEREF(tm).
               This version listed 1,055 drives and 286 controllers.
               
VERSION 4.10   This version brought sections on Floppy Drives and Optical
01-04-91       Drives.  "Diagrams.Doc" was offically released with this 
               version.  The Manufacturers Directory was expanded to four
               parts to cover the new sections, and page 5 was added to the
               Diagrams.doc file.  This version listed 1,282 Hard Drives,
               86 Floppy Drives, 140 Optical Drives, and 315 Controllers.
               
VERSION 4.11   Important correction to Diagrams.doc file.  A "bug fix" file
               was sent to distribution points for insertion.                   
               
VERSION 4.12   Minor correction to Diagrams.doc file.  No corrections sent
               out.

VERSION 4.20   This version...for better or worse...I hope you think that
10-01-91       it's better.  If not, I'd like to know why.
