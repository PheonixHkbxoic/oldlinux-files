Under most operating systems (UNIX included), there is the concept of a 
<b>file</b>, which is just a bundle of information which is given a 
name (called a <b>filename</b>). Examples of files would be your
history term paper, an e-mail message, or an actual program which can be
executed. Essentially, anything which is saved on disk is saved in 
an individual file.
<P>
<A NAME=1901>&#160;</A>
Files are identified by their filenames. For example, the file containing 
your history paper might be saved with the filename <tt>history-paper</tt>. 
These names usually identify the file and its contents in some form
which is meaningful to you. There is no standard format for filenames
as there is under MS-DOS and other operating systems; in general, filenames
may contain any character (except <tt>/</tt>---see the discussion of
pathnames, below), and are limited to 256 characters in length.
<P>
<A NAME=1904>&#160;</A>
With the concept of files comes the concept of directories. A
<b>directory</b> is just a collection of files. It can be thought of
as a ``folder'' which contains many different files. Directories
themselves are given names, with which you can identify them. 
Furthermore, directories are maintained in a tree-like structure;
that is, directories may contain other directories.
<P>
<A NAME=1906>&#160;</A>
A file may be referred to by its <b>pathname</b>, which is made up of
the filename, preceded by the name of the directory which contains the file.
For example, let's say that Larry has a directory called <tt>papers</tt>,
which contains three files: <tt>history-final</tt>, <tt>english-lit</tt>,
and <tt>masters-thesis</tt>. (Each of these three files contains information
for three of Larry's ongoing projects.) To refer to the file
<tt>english-lit</tt>, Larry can specify the file's pathname: 
<P><TT> papers/english-lit
 <P></TT>
<P>
<A NAME=2075>&#160;</A>
As you can see, the directory and file names are separated by a single
slash (<tt>/</tt>). For this reason, filenames themselves cannot contain the
<tt>/</tt> character.  MS-DOS users will find this convention familiar, 
although in the MS-DOS world, the backslash (<code>\</code>) is used instead.
<P>
<A NAME=1918>&#160;</A>
As mentioned, directories can be nested within each other as well. For
example, let's say that Larry has another directory, within <tt>papers</tt>, 
called <tt>notes</tt>. This directory contains the files <tt>math-notes</tt>
and <tt>cheat-sheet</tt>. The pathname of the file <tt>cheat-sheet</tt> would be
<P><TT> papers/notes/cheat-sheet
 <P></TT>
<P>
<A NAME=1926>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=1927>&#160;</A>
Therefore, the pathname really is a ``path'' which you take to
locate a certain file. The directory above a given subdirectory is
known as the <b>parent directory</b>. Here, the directory <tt>papers</tt>
is the parent of the <tt>notes</tt> directory.
