<P>
These documents should be available on any of the Linux FTP archive sites
(see Appendix <A HREF="node235.html#appftplistnum">C</A> for a list). If you do not have direct
access to FTP, you may be able to locate these documents on other online
services (such as CompuServe, local BBS's, and so on). If you have access
to Internet mail, you can use the <tt>ftpmail</tt> service to receive these
docucments. See Appendix <A HREF="node235.html#appftplistnum">C</A> for more information.
<P>
In particular, the following documents may be found on <tt>sunsite.unc.edu</tt>
in the directory <tt>/pub/Linux/docs</tt>. Many sites mirror this
directory; however, if you're unable to locate a mirror site near you,
this is a good one to fall back on.
<P>
You can also access Linux files and documentation using <tt>gopher</tt>.
Just point your <tt>gopher</tt> client to port 70 on <tt>sunsite.unc.edu</tt>,
and follow the menus to the Linux archive. This is a good way to 
browse Linux documentation interactively.

<DL COMPACT><DT><em>The Linux Frequently Asked Questions List</em>
<DD>
<A NAME=6225>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=6226>&#160;</A>
The Linux Frequently Asked Questions list, or ``FAQ'', is a list of 
common questions (and answers!) about Linux. This document is meant to 
provide a general source of information about Linux, common problems and
solutions, and a list of other sources of information. Every new Linux
user should read this document. It is available in a number of formats,
including plain ASCII, PostScript, and Lout typesetter format. The Linux
FAQ is maintained by Ian Jackson, <tt>ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu</tt>.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux META-FAQ</em>
<DD>
The META-FAQ is a collection of ``metaquestions'' about Linux; that is, 
sources of information about the Linux system, and other general topics.
It is a good starting place for the Internet user wishing to find more
information about the system. It is maintained by Michael K. Johnson,
<tt>johnsonm@sunsite.unc.edu</tt>.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux INFO-SHEET</em>
<DD>
The Linux INFO-SHEET is a technical introduction to the Linux system. It
gives an overview of the system's features and available software, and
also provides a list of other sources of Linux information. The format and
content is similar in nature to the META-FAQ; incidentally, it is also
maintained by Michael K. Johnson.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Software Map</em>
<DD>
<A NAME=6232>&#160;</A>
The Linux Software Map is a list of many applications available for
Linux, where to get them, who maintains them, and so forth. It is far
from complete---to compile a complete list of Linux software would be
nearly impossible. However, it does include many of the most popular
Linux software packages. If you can't find a particular application
to suit your needs, the LSM is a good place to start. It is maintained
by Lars Wirzenius, <tt>lars.wirzenius@helsinki.fi</tt>.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux HOWTO Index</em>
<DD>
<A NAME=6235>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=6236>&#160;</A>
The Linux HOWTOs are a collection of ``how to'' documents, each describing
in detail a certain aspect of the Linux system. They are maintained by
Matt Welsh, <tt>mdw@sunsite.unc.edu</tt>. The HOWTO Index lists the HOWTO
documents which are available (several of which are listed below).
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Installation HOWTO</em>
<DD>
The Linux Installation HOWTO describes
how to obtain and install a distribution of Linux, similar to the information
presented in Chapter <A HREF="node50.html#chapinstallnum">2</A>.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Distribution HOWTO</em>
<DD>
This document is a list of Linux distributions available via mail order and
anonymous FTP. It also includes information on other Linux-related goodies
and services. Appendix <A HREF="node234.html#appvendornum">B</A> contains a list of Linux
vendors, many of which are listed in the <em>Distribution HOWTO</em>.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux XFree86 HOWTO</em>
<DD>
This document describes how to install and configure the X Window System
software for Linux. See the section ``<A HREF="node198.html#secxwindows">5.1</A>'' for more about
the X Window System.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Mail, News, and UUCP HOWTOs</em>
<DD>
These three HOWTO documents describe configuration and setup of electronic
mail, news, and UUCP communications on a Linux system. Because these
three subjects are often intertwined, you may wish to read all three of
these HOWTOs together.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Hardware HOWTO</em>
<DD>
This HOWTO contains an extensive list of hardware supported by Linux.
While this list is far from complete, it should give you a general picture
of which hardware devices should be supported by the system.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux SCSI HOWTO</em>
<DD>
The Linux SCSI HOWTO is a complete guide to configuration and usage of
SCSI devices under Linux, such as hard drives, tape drives and CD-ROM.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux NET-2-HOWTO</em>
<DD>
The Linux NET-2-HOWTO describes installation, setup, and configuration of
the ``NET-2'' TCP/IP software under Linux, including SLIP. If you 
want to use TCP/IP on your Linux system, this document is a must read.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Ethernet HOWTO</em>
<DD>
Closely related to the NET-2-HOWTO, the Ethernet HOWTO describes the various
Ethernet devices supported by Linux, and explains how to configure each of
them for use by the Linux TCP/IP software.
<P>
<DT><em>The Linux Printing HOWTO</em>
<DD>
This document describes how to configure printing software under Linux, 
such as <tt>lpr</tt>. Configuration of printers and printing software under
UNIX can be very confusing at times; this document sheds some light on the
subject.
<P>
<DT><em>Other online documents</em>
<DD>
If you browse the <tt>docs</tt> subdirectory of any Linux FTP site, you'll
see many other documents which are not listed here: A slew of FAQ's, 
interesting tidbits, and other important information. This miscellany
is difficult to categorize here; if you don't see what you're looking for
on the list above, just take a look at one of the Linux archive sites
listed in Appendix <A HREF="node235.html#appftplistnum">C</A>.
