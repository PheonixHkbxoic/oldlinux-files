SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) allows you to use TCP/IP 
over a serial line, be that a phone line, with a dialup modem, or
a leased asynchronous line of some sort. Of course, to use SLIP you'll
need access to a dial-in SLIP server in your area. Many universities
and businesses provide SLIP access for a modest fee.

There are two major SLIP-related programs available---<tt>dip</tt> and
<tt>slattach</tt>. Both of these programs are used to initiate a SLIP
connection over a serial device. It is <em>necessary</em> to use one 
of these programs in order to enable SLIP---it will not suffice to
dial up the SLIP server (with a communications program such as 
<tt>kermit</tt>) and issue <tt>ifconfig</tt> and <tt>route</tt> commands. 
This is because <tt>dip</tt> and <tt>slattach</tt> issue a special 
<em>ioctl()</em> system call to seize control of the serial device to
be used as a SLIP interface.
<P>
<tt>dip</tt> can be used to dial up a SLIP server, 
do some handshaking to login to the server (exchanging your username
and password, for example) and then initate the SLIP connection over the
open serial line. <tt>slattach</tt>, on the other hand, does very little
other than grab the serial device for use by SLIP. It is useful if you
have a permanent line to your SLIP server and no modem dialup or handshaking
is necessary to initiate the connection. Most dialup SLIP users should
use <tt>dip</tt>, on the other hand.
<P>
<tt>dip</tt> can also be used to configure your Linux system as a SLIP
server, where other machines can dial into your own and connect to the
network through a secondary Ethernet connection on your machine.
See the documentation and man pages for <tt>dip</tt> for more information
on this procedure.

SLIP is quite unlike Ethernet, in that there are only two machines
on the ``network''---the SLIP host (that's you) and the SLIP server. 
For this reason, SLIP is often referred to as a ``point-to-point'' 
connection. A generalization of this idea, known as PPP (Point to Point
Protocol) has also been implemented for Linux.
<P>
When you initiate a connection to a SLIP server, the SLIP server will
give you an IP address based on (usually) one of two methods. Some
SLIP servers allocate ``static'' IP addresses---in which case your
IP address will be the same every time you connect to the server.
However, many SLIP servers allocate IP addresses dynamically---in which
case you receive a different IP address each time you connect. 
In general, the SLIP server will print the values of your IP and
gateway addresses when you connect. <tt>dip</tt> is capable of reading
these values from the output of the SLIP server login session and
using them to configure the SLIP device.
<P>
Essentially, configuring a SLIP connection is just like configuring
for loopback or ethernet. The main differences are discussed below.
Read the previous section on configuring the basic TCP/IP files, 
and apply the changes described below.
