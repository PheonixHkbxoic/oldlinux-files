<P>
Why use Linux instead of a well-known, well-tested, and well-documented
commercial operating system? We could give you a thousand reasons. One of
the most important, however, is that Linux is an excellent choice for
personal UNIX computing. If you're a UNIX software developer, why use 
MS-DOS at home? Linux will allow you to develop and test UNIX software
on your PC, including database and X Windows applications.
If you're a student, chances are that your university
computing systems run UNIX. With Linux, you can run your own UNIX system
and tailor it to your own needs. Installing and running Linux is also an
excellent way to learn UNIX if you don't have access to other UNIX machines.
<P>
But let's not lose sight. Linux isn't just for personal UNIX users. It is
robust and complete enough to handle large tasks, as well as distributed 
computing needs. Many businesses---especially small ones---are moving to
Linux in lieu of other UNIX-based workstation environments. 
Universities are finding Linux to be perfect for teaching courses in 
operating systems design. Larger commercial software vendors are starting
to realize the opportunities that a free operating system can provide.
<P>
The following sections should point out the most
important differences between Linux and other operating systems. We hope
that you'll find that Linux can meet your computing needs, or (at least)
enhance your current computing environment. Keep in mind that they best way 
to get a taste for Linux is just to try it out---you 
needn't even install a complete system to get a feel for it. In 
Chapter <A HREF="node50.html#chapinstallnum">2</A>, we'll show you how.
