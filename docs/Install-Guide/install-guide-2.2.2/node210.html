<tt>rc</tt> files are systemwide configuration scripts executed at boot
time by <tt>init</tt>, which start up all of the basic system daemons
(such as <tt>sendmail</tt>, <tt>cron</tt>, etc.) and configure things
such as the network parameters, system hostname, and so on.
<tt>rc</tt> files are usually found in the directory <tt>/etc/rc.d</tt> but
on other systems may be in <tt>/etc</tt>.

<A NAME=6063>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=6064>&#160;</A>
Here, we're going to describe the <tt>rc</tt> files used to configure
TCP/IP. There are two of them: <tt>rc.inet1</tt> and <tt>rc.inet2</tt>.
<tt>rc.inet1</tt> is used to configure the basic network parameters
(such as IP addresses and routing information) and <tt>rc.inet2</tt> 
fires up the TCP/IP daemons (<tt>telnetd</tt>, <tt>ftpd</tt>, and so forth).

<A NAME=6066>&#160;</A>

<A NAME=6068>&#160;</A>
Many systems combine these two files into one, usually called <tt>rc.inet</tt>
or <tt>rc.net</tt>. The names given to your <tt>rc</tt> files doesn't matter, 
as long as they perform the correct functions and are executed at boot time by
<tt>init</tt>. To ensure this, you may need to edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> 
and uncomment lines to execute the appropriate <tt>rc</tt> file(s). In the
worst case you will have to create the <tt>rc.inet1</tt>  and <tt>rc.inet2</tt>
files from scratch and add entries for them to <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>.
<P>
As we said, <tt>rc.inet1</tt> configures the basic network interface.
This includes your IP and network address, and the routing table information
for your network. The routing tables are used to route outgoing (and
incoming) network datagrams to other machines. On most simple configurations,
you have three routes: One for sending packets to your own machine, 
another for sending packets to other machines on your network, and
another for sending packets to machines outside of your network (through
the gateway machine). Two programs are used to configure these parameters:
<tt>ifconfig</tt> and <tt>route</tt>. Both of these are usually found in <tt>/etc</tt>.

<A NAME=6071>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=6072>&#160;</A>
<tt>ifconfig</tt> is used for configuring the network device interface with 
the parameters that it requires to function, such as the IP address, network 
mask, broadcast address and the like.
<tt>route</tt> is used to create and modify entries in the routing table.

For most configurations, an <tt>rc.inet1</tt> file that looks like the following
should work. You will, of course, have to edit this for your own system.
Do <em>not</em> use the sample IP and network addresses listed here for
your own system; they correspond to an actual machine on the Internet.

<P><TT> <PRE>#!/bin/sh
# This is /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 -- Configure the TCP/IP interfaces

# First, configure the loopback device

HOSTNAME=`hostname`

/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1      # uses default netmask 255.0.0.0
/etc/route add 127.0.0.1        # a route to point to the loopback device

# Next, configure the ethernet device. If you're only using loopback or 
# SLIP, comment out the rest of these lines.

# Edit for your setup.
IPADDR=&quot;128.253.154.32&quot;         # REPLACE with YOUR IP address
NETMASK=&quot;255.255.255.0&quot;	        # REPLACE with YOUR netmask
NETWORK=&quot;128.253.154.0&quot;         # REPLACE with YOUR network address
BROADCAST=&quot;128.253.154.255&quot;     # REPLACE with YOUR broadcast address, if you
                                # have one. If not, leave blank and edit below.
GATEWAY=&quot;128.253.154.1&quot;         # REPLACE with YOUR gateway address!

/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}

# If you don't have a broadcast address, change the above line to just:
# /etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} 

/etc/route add ${NETWORK}

# The following is only necessary if you have a gateway; that is, your
# network is connected to the outside world.
/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1

# End of Ethernet Configuration

Again, you may have to tweak this file somewhat to get it
to work. The above should be sufficient for the majority of simple
network configurations, but certainly not all.

<tt>rc.inet2</tt> starts up various servers used by the TCP/IP suite. 
The most important of these is <tt>inetd</tt>. <tt>inetd</tt> sits in the
background and listens to various network ports. When a machine
tries to make a connection to a certain port (for example, the
incoming <tt>telnet</tt> port), <tt>inetd</tt> forks off a copy of the
appropriate daemon for that port (in the case of the <tt>telnet</tt>
port, <tt>inetd</tt> starts <tt>in.telnetd</tt>). This is simpler than
running many separate, standalone daemons (e.g., individual copies
of <tt>telnetd</tt>, <tt>ftpd</tt>, and so forth)---<tt>inetd</tt> starts up
the daemons only when they are needed.

<tt>syslogd</tt> is the system logging daemon---it accumulates log messages
from various applications and stores them into log files based on
the configuration information in <tt>/etc/syslogd.conf</tt>.
<tt>routed</tt> is a server used to maintain dynamic routing information.
When your system attempts to send packets to another network, it may
require additional routing table entries in order to do so. 
<tt>routed</tt> takes care of manipulating the routing table without
the need for user intervention.

Our example <tt>rc.inet2</tt>, below, only starts up the bare minimum
of servers. There are many other servers as well---many of which have
to do with NFS configuration. When attempting to setup TCP/IP on your
system, it's usually best to start with a minimal configuration and
add more complex pieces (such as NFS) when you have things working.
<P>
Note that in the below file, we assume that all of the network daemons
are held in <tt>/etc</tt>. As usual, edit this for your own configuration.

# Sample /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2

# Start syslogd

then

# Start inetd

then
      /etc/inetd

# Start routed
if [ -f /etc/routed ]
then

Among the various additional servers that you may want to start in
<tt>rc.inet2</tt> is <tt>named</tt>. <tt>named</tt> is a name server---it 
is responsible for translating (local) IP addresses to names, and vice
versa. If you don't have a nameserver elsewhere on the network, or
want to provide local machine names to other machines in your domain,
it may be necessary to run <tt>named</tt>. (For most configurations it
is not necessary, however.) <tt>named</tt> configuration is somewhat
complex and requires planning; we refer interested readers to a good
book on TCP/IP network administration.
