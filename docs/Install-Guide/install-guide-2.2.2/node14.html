Almost every computer user has a need for some kind of document preparation
system. (How many computer enthusiasts do you know who still use pen and 
paper? Not many, we'll wager.)
In the PC world, <em>word processing</em> is the norm: it involves
editing and manipulating text (often in a 
``What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get'' environment) and 
producing printed copies of the text, complete with figures, tables, and 
other garnishes.
<A NAME=263>&#160;</A>
<P>
In the UNIX world, <em>text processing</em> is much more common, which is
quite different than the classical concept of word processing. 
With a text processing system, text is entered by the
author using a ``typesetting language'', which describes how the
text should be formatted. Instead of entering the text within a special
word processing environment, the source may be modified with any text 
editor such as <tt>vi</tt> or Emacs. Once the source text (in the typesetting 
language) is complete, the user formats the text with a separate program, 
which converts the source to a format suitable for printing.
This is somewhat analogous to programming in a language such as C, and
``compiling'' the document into a printable form.
<P>

There are many text processing systems available for Linux. One is 
<tt>groff</tt>, the GNU version of the classic <tt>nroff</tt> text formatter
originally developed by Bell Labs and still used on many UNIX systems
worldwide. Another modern text processing system is <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img13.gif">, developed by
Donald Knuth of computer science fame.
Dialects of <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img14.gif">, such as <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img15.gif">, are also available.
<P>
Text processors such as <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img16.gif"> and <tt>groff</tt> differ mostly in the syntax
of their formatting languages. 
The choice of one formatting system over
another is also based upon what utilities are available to satisfy your needs,
as well as personal taste.
<P>
For example, some people consider the <tt>groff</tt> formatting language to
be a bit obscure, so they use <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img17.gif">, which is more readable by humans. 
However, <tt>groff</tt> is capable of producing plain ASCII output, viewable
on a terminal, while <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img18.gif"> is intended primarily for output to a printing
device. However, various programs exist to produce plain ASCII from 
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img19.gif">-formatted documents, or to convert <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img20.gif"> to <tt>groff</tt>, for example.
<P>
Another text processing system is <tt>texinfo</tt>, an extension to 
<A NAME=303>&#160;</A>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img21.gif"> used for software documentation by the Free Software Foundation.
<tt>texinfo</tt> is capable of producing a printed document, or
an online-browsable hypertext ``Info'' document from a single source
file. Info files are the main format of documentation used by GNU software
such as Emacs.
<A NAME=278>&#160;</A>

<P>
Text processors are used widely in the computing community
for producing papers, theses, magazine articles, and books (in fact, this
book was produced using <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img22.gif">). The ability to process the source
language as a plain text file opens the door to many extensions to the
text processor itself. Because source documents are not stored in an 
obscure format, readable only by a particular word processor, programmers
are able to write parsers and translators for the formatting language,
extending the system.
<P>
What does such a formatting language look like? In general, the
formatting language source consists mostly of the text itself, along with
``control codes'' to produce a particular effect, such as changing fonts,
setting margins, creating lists, and so on.
<P>
As an example, take the following text:
<blockquote> Mr. Torvalds:
<P>
We are very upset with your current plans to implement <em>post-hypnotic
suggestion</em> in the <b>Linux</b> terminal driver code. We feel this
way for three reasons:
<OL><LI> Planting subliminal messages in the terminal driver is not only
      immoral, it is a waste of time;
<LI> It has been proven that ``post-hypnotic suggestions'' are ineffective
      when used upon unsuspecting UNIX hackers;
<LI> We have already implemented high-voltage electric shocks, as a 
      security measure, in the code for <tt>login</tt>.
</OL>
We hope you will reconsider. 
</blockquote>
<P>
This text would appear in the <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img23.gif"> formatting language as the following:
<P><TT> <PRE>\begin{quote}
Mr. Torvalds:

      when used upon unsuspecting UNIX hackers;

<P>
The author enters the above ``source'' text using any text editor, and
generates the formatted output by processing the source with <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img24.gif">. 
At first glance, the typesetting language may appear to be obscure, but
it's actually quite easy to learn. Using a text processing system 
enforces typographical standards when writing. For example, all
enumerated lists within a document will look the same, unless the author 
modifies the definition of the enumerated list ``environment''. The
primary goal is to allow the author to concentrate on writing the
actual text, instead of worrying about typesetting conventions.
<P>
WYSIWYG word processors are attractive for many reasons; they provide a
<A NAME=289>&#160;</A>
powerful (and sometimes complex) visual interface for editing the
document. However, this interface is inherently limited to those aspects
of text layout which are accessible to the user. For example, many word
processors provide a special ``format language'' for producing complicated
expressions such as mathematical formulae. This is identical 
text processing, albeit on a much smaller scale.
<P>
The subtle benefit of text processing is that the system allows you to specify
exactly what you mean. Also, text processing systems allow you to edit the 
source text with any text editor, and the source is easily converted to 
other formats. 
The tradeoff for this flexibility and power is the lack of a 
WYSIWYG interface.
<P>
Many users of word processors are used to seeing the formatted text as
they edit it. On the other hand, when writing with a text processor, 
one generally does not worry about how the text will appear when formatted.
The writer learns to expect how the text should look from the formatting
commands used in the source.
<P>
There are programs which allow you to view the formatted document on 
a graphics display before printing. For example, the <tt>xdvi</tt> program 
displays a ``device independent'' file generated by the <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img25.gif"> system under
the X Windows environment. Other software applications, such as <tt>xfig</tt>,
provide a WYSIWYG graphics interface for drawing figures and diagrams, which
are subsequently converted to the text processing language for inclusion in
your document.
<P>
Admittedly, text processors such as <tt>nroff</tt> were around long before
word processing was available. However, many people still prefer to use
text processing, because it is more versatile and independent of
a graphics environment. In either case, the <tt>idoc</tt> word processor
is also available for Linux, and before long we expect to see commercial
word processors becoming available as well. If you absolutely don't want to
give up word processing for text processing, you can always run MS-DOS,
or some other operating system, in addition to Linux.
<P>

<P>
There are many other text-processing-related utilities available. The
powerful METAFONT system, used for designing fonts for <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img26.gif">, is included
<A NAME=294>&#160;</A>
with the Linux port of <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img27.gif">. Other programs include <tt>ispell</tt>, an 
interactive spell checker and corrector; <tt>makeindex</tt>, used for 
generating indicies in <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img28.gif"> documents; as well as many <tt>groff</tt> 
and <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img29.gif">-based macro packages for formatting many types of documents
and mathematical texts. Conversion programs to translate between
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img30.gif"> or <tt>groff</tt> source to a myriad of other formats are available.
