Now you must be convinced of how wonderful Linux is, and all of the great
things that it can do for you. However, before you rush out and install
the software, you need to be aware of the hardware requirements and 
limitations that Linux has. 
<A NAME=516>&#160;</A>
<P>
Keep in mind that Linux was developed by its users. This means, for the
most part, that the hardware which is supported by Linux is only the
hardware which the users and developers actually have access to. As it turns
out, most of the popular hardware and peripherals for 80386/80486 systems
are supported (in fact, Linux supports more hardware than some
commercial implementations of UNIX). However, some of the more obscure and
esoteric devices aren't supported yet. As time goes on, a wider
range of hardware is supported, so if your favorite devices aren't
listed here, chances are that support for them is forthcoming.
<P>
Another drawback for hardware support under Linux is that many companies
have decided to keep the hardware interface proprietary. The upshot of this
is that volunteer Linux developers simply can't write drivers for those
devices (if they could, those drivers would be owned by the company that
owned the interface, which would violate the GPL). The companies that
maintain proprietary interfaces write their own drivers for operating systems
such as MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows; the end user (that's you) never
needs to know about the interface. Unfortunately, this does not allow Linux
developers to write drivers for those devices.
<P>
There is very little that can be done about the situation. In some cases,
programmers have attempted to write hackish drivers based on assumptions
about the interface. In other cases, developers will work with the company
in question and attempt to obtain information about the device interface,
with varying degrees of success.
<P>
In the following sections, we'll attempt to summarize the hardware 
requirements for Linux. The Linux <em>Hardware HOWTO</em> (see
Section <A HREF="node43.html#secintrosources">1.9</A>) contains a more complete listing of 
hardware supported by Linux.
<P>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> a good deal of hardware
support for Linux is currently in the development stage. Some distributions
may or may not support these experimental features. This section primarily
lists hardware which has been supported for some time and is known to be
stable. When in doubt, consult the documentation for the distribution of
Linux you are using (see Section <A HREF="node51.html#secinstalldistrib">2.1</A> for 
more information on Linux distributions).
