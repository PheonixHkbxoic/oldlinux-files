Let's look at an example to demonstrate file permissions. Using the
<tt>ls</tt> command with the <tt>-l</tt> option will display a ``long''
listing of the file, including file permissions. 
<P><TT> /home/larry/foo# <em>ls -l stuff</em>
<PRE>-rw-r--r--   1 larry    users         505 Mar 13 19:05 stuff
</PRE>
/home/larry/foo#
 <P></TT>
<P>
The first field printed in the listing represents the file permissions.
The third field is the owner of the file (<tt>larry</tt>), and the fourth
field is the group to which the file belongs (<tt>users</tt>). Obviously,
the last field is the name of the file (<tt>stuff</tt>), and we'll cover the
other fields later.
<P>
This file is owned by <tt>larry</tt>, and belongs to the group <tt>users</tt>.
Let's look at the file permissions. The string <tt>-rw-r--r--</tt> lists,
in order, the permissions granted to the file's owner, the file's group,
and everybody else.
<P>
The first character of the permissions string (``<tt>-</tt>'') represents the
type of file. A ``<tt>-</tt>'' just means that this is a regular file (as
opposed to a directory or device driver). The next three letters 
(``<tt>rw-</tt>'') represent the permissions granted to the file's owner,
<tt>larry</tt>. The ``<tt>r</tt>'' stands for ``read'' and the ``<tt>w</tt>''
stands for ``write''. Thus, <tt>larry</tt> has read and write permission
to the file <tt>stuff</tt>.
<P>
As we mentioned, besides read and write permission, there is also
``execute'' permission---represented by an ``<tt>x</tt>''. However, there
is a ``<tt>-</tt>'' here in place of the ``<tt>x</tt>'', so Larry doesn't
have execute permission on this file. This is fine, the file <tt>stuff</tt>
isn't a program of any kind. Of course, because Larry owns the file,
he may grant himself execute permission for the file if he so desires.
This will be covered shortly.
<P>
The next three characters, <tt>r--</tt>, represent the group's permissions
on the file. The group which owns this file is <tt>users</tt>. Because
only an ``<tt>r</tt>'' appears here, any user which belongs to the group
<tt>users</tt> may read this file.
<P>
The last three characters, also <tt>r--</tt>, represent the permissions
granted to every other user on the system (other than the owner of the
file and those in the group <tt>users</tt>). Again, because only an
``<tt>r</tt>'' is present, other users may read the file, but not write to
it or execute it.
<P>
Here are some other examples of group permissions.
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>-rwxr-xr-x</tt>
<DD>
The owner of the file may
read, write, and execute the file. Users in the file's group, and all other 
users, may read and execute the file.
<P>
<DT><tt>-rw-------</tt>
<DD>
The owner of the file may 
read and write the file. No other user can access the file.
<P>
<DT><tt>-rwxrwxrwx</tt>
<DD>
All users may read, write, and execute the file.
