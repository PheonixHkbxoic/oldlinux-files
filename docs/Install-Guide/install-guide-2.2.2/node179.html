Another duty of the system administrator is upgrading and installing 
new software.
<P>
The Linux community is very dynamic. New kernel releases come out every
few weeks, and other software is updated almost as often. Because of
this, new Linux users often feel the need to upgrade their systems 
constantly to keep up the the rapidly changing pace. Not only is this
unnecessary, it's a waste of time: to keep up with all of the changes
in the Linux world, you would be spending all of your time upgrading and
none of your time using the system.
<P>
So, when should you upgrade? Some people feel that you should upgrade 
when a new distribution release is made---for example, when Slackware comes
out with a new version. Many Linux users completely reinstall their
system with the newest Slackware release every time. This, also, is a waste
of time. In general, changes to Slackware releases are small. Downloading
and reinstalling 30 disks when only 10% of the software has been actually
modified is, of course, pointless.
<P>
The best way to upgrade your system is to do it by hand: only upgrade
those software packages which you know that you should upgrade. This
scares a lot of people: they want to know what to upgrade, and how, and
what will break if they don't upgrade. In order to be successful with
Linux, it's important to overcome your fears of ``doing it yourself''---
which is what Linux is all about. In fact, once you have your system
working and all software correctly configured, reinstalling with
the newest release will no doubt wipe all of your configuration and
things will be broken again, just as they were when you first installed
your system. Setting yourself back in this manner is unnecessary---all
that is needed is some know-how about upgrading your system, and how to
do it right.
<P>
You'll find that when you upgrade one component of your
system, other things should not break. For example, most of the
software on my system is left over from an ancient 0.96 MCC Interim
installation. Yet, I run the newest version of the kernel and libraries
with this software with no problem. For the most part, senselessly
upgrading to ``keep up with the trend'' is not important at all. This
isn't MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows. There is no important reason to 
run the newest version of all of the software. If you find that you
would like or need features in a new version, then upgrade. If not,
then don't. In other words, only upgrade what you have to, and when
you have to. Don't just upgrade for the sake of upgrading. That will waste
a lot of time and effort trying to keep up.
<P>
The most important software to upgrade on your system is the kernel,
the libraries, and the <tt>gcc</tt> compiler. These are the three
essential parts of your system, and in some cases they all depend on
each other for everything to work successfully. Most of the other
software on your system does not need to be upgraded periodically.
