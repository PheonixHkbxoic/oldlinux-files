<P>
Your <tt>XF86Config</tt> file is now ready to go, with the exception of
complete information on the video card. What we're going to do is
use the X server to probe for the rest of this information, and fill it
into <tt>XF86Config</tt>.
<P>
Instead of probing for this information with the X server, the
<tt>XF86Config</tt> values for many cards are listed in the files
<tt>modeDB.txt</tt>, <tt>AccelCards</tt>, and <tt>Devices</tt>. These files
are all found in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</tt>. In addition, there
are various <tt>README</tt> files for certain chipsets. You should
look in these files for information on your video card, and use
that information (the clock values, chipset type, and any options)
in the <tt>XF86Config</tt> file. If any information is missing, you
can probe for it as described here.
<P>
In these examples we will demonstrate configuration for a 
#9 GXE 64 video card, which uses the <tt>XF86_S3</tt> chipset.
This card happens to be the one which the author uses, but
the discussion here applies to any video card.
<P>
The first thing to do is to determine the video chipset used on the card.
Running <tt>SuperProbe</tt> (found in <tt>/usr/X11R6/bin</tt>) will tell you
this information, but you need to know the chipset name as it is known to
the X server.
<P>
To do this, run the command
<P><TT> X -showconfig
 <P></TT>
This will give the chipset names known to your X server. (The man pages
for each X server list these as well.)  For example, with the
accelerated <tt>XF86_S3</tt> server, we obtain:
<P><TT> <PRE>XFree86 Version 3.1 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6000)
Operating System: Linux 
Configured drivers:
  S3: accelerated server for S3 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0)
      mmio_928, s3_generic
</PRE> <P></TT>
<P>
The valid chipset names for this server are <tt>mmio_928</tt> and
<tt>s3_generic</tt>. The <tt>XF86_S3</tt> man page describes these chipsets
and which videocards use them. In the case of the #9 GXE 64 video
card, <tt>mmio_928</tt> is appropriate.
<P>
If you don't know which chipset to use, the X server can probe it 
for you. To do this, run the command
<P><TT> <code>X -probeonly &gt; /tmp/x.out 2&gt;&amp;1 </code>
 <P></TT>
if you use <tt>bash</tt> as your shell. If you use <tt>csh</tt>, try:
<P><TT> <code>X -probeonly &amp;&gt; /tmp/x.out </code>
 <P></TT>
<P>
You should run this command while the system is unloaded, that is,
while no other activity is occurring on the system. This command will also
probe for your video card dot clocks (as seen below), and system load can 
throw off this calculation.
<P>
The output from the above (in <tt>/tmp/x.out</tt> should contain lines such
as the following:
<P><TT> <code>XFree86 Version 3.1 / X Window System </code><BR>
<code>(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6000) </code><BR>
<code>Operating System: Linux  </code><BR>
<code>Configured drivers: </code><BR>
<code>  S3: accelerated server for S3 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0) </code><BR>
<code>      mmio_928, s3_generic </code><BR>
<em>Several lines deleted...</em> <BR>
<code>(--) S3: card type: 386/486 localbus </code><BR>
<code>(--) S3: chipset:   864 rev. 0 </code><BR>
<code>(--) S3: chipset driver: mmio_928 </code>
 <P></TT>
Here, we see that the two valid chipsets for this server (in this case,
<tt>XF86_S3</tt>) are <tt>mmio_928</tt> and <tt>s3_generic</tt>. The server
probed for and found a video card using the <tt>mmio_928</tt> chipset.
<P>
In the <tt>Device</tt> section of the <tt>XF86Config</tt> file, add a <tt>Chipset</tt> 
line, containing the name of the chipset as determined above. For example,
<P><TT> <PRE>Section &quot;Device&quot; 
        # We already had Identifier here...
        Identifier &quot;#9 GXE 64&quot;  
        # Add this line:
        Chipset &quot;mmio_928&quot;
EndSection
</PRE> <P></TT>
<P>
Now we need to determine the driving clock frequencies used by the video card. 
A driving clock frequency, or dot clock, is simply a rate at which the
video card can send pixels to the monitor. As we have seen, each monitor
resolution has a dot clock associated with it. Now we need to determine
which dot clocks are made available by the video card.
<P>
First you should look into the files (<tt>modeDB.txt</tt>, and so forth) 
mentioned above and see if your card's clocks are listed there. 
The dot clocks will usually be a list of 8 or 16 values, all of which
are in MHz. For example, when looking at <tt>modeDB.txt</tt> we see an
entry for the Cardinal ET4000 video board, which looks like this:
<P><TT> <PRE># chip    ram   virtual   clocks                           default-mode  flags
 ET4000   1024  1024 768   25  28  38  36  40  45  32   0  &quot;1024x768&quot;
</PRE> <P></TT>
As we can see, the dot clocks for this card are 25, 28, 38, 36, 40, 45, 32, 
and 0 MHz.
<P>
In the <tt>Devices</tt> section of the <tt>XF86Config</tt> file, you should
add a <tt>Clocks</tt> line containing the list of dot clocks for your card.
For example, for the clocks above, we would add the line
<P><TT> <PRE>        Clocks 25 28 38 36 40 45 32 0
</PRE> <P></TT>
to the <tt>Devices</tt> section of the file, after <tt>Chipset</tt>.
Note that the order of the clocks is important! Don't resort the list
of clocks or remove duplicates.
<P>
If you cannot find the dot clocks associated with your card, the X server
can probe for these as well. Using the <tt>X -probeonly</tt> command described
above, the output should contain lines which look like the following:
<P><TT> <PRE>(--) S3: clocks:  25.18  28.32  38.02  36.15  40.33  45.32  32.00  00.00
</PRE> <P></TT>
We could then add a <tt>Clocks</tt> line containing all of these values,
as printed. You can use more than one <tt>Clocks</tt> line in <tt>XF86Config</tt>
should all of the values (sometimes there are more than 8 clock values
printed) not fit onto one line. Again, be sure to keep the list of clocks
in order as they are printed.
<P>
Be sure that there is no <tt>Clocks</tt> line (or that it is commented out)
in the <tt>Devices</tt> section of the file when using <tt>X -probeonly</tt>
to probe for the clocks. If there is a <tt>Clocks</tt> line present, the
server will <em>not</em> probe for the clocks---it will use the values
given in <tt>XF86Config</tt>.
<P>
Note that some accelerated video boards use a programmable clock chip.
(See the <tt>XF86_Accel</tt> man page for details; this generally applies
to S3, AGX, and XGA-2 boards.)
This chip essentially allows the X server to tell the card which dot clocks
to use. If this is the case, then you may not find a list of dot clocks
for the card in any of the above files. Or, the list of dot clocks printed
when using <tt>X -probeonly</tt> will only contain one or two discrete clock 
values, with the rest being duplicates or zero.
<P>
For boards which use a programmable clock chip, you would use a 
<tt>ClockChip</tt> line, instead of a <tt>Clocks</tt> line, in your
<tt>XF86Config</tt> file. <tt>ClockChip</tt> gives the name of the clock chip
as used by the video card; the man pages for each server describe what
these are. For example, in the file <tt>README.S3</tt>, we see that 
several S3-864 video cards use an ``ICD2061A'' clock chip, and that we
should use the line
<P><TT> <code>        ClockChip &quot;icd2061a&quot; </code>
 <P></TT>
instead of <tt>Clocks</tt> in the <tt>XF86Config</tt> file. As with <tt>Clocks</tt>,
this line should go in the <tt>Devices</tt> section, after <tt>Chipset</tt>.
<P>
Similarly, some accelerated cards require you to specify the RAMDAC chip
type in the <tt>XF86Config</tt> file, using a <tt>Ramdac</tt> line.
The <tt>XF86_Accel</tt> man page describes this option. Usually, the X
server will correctly probe for the RAMDAC.
<P>
Some video card types require you to specify several options in the 
<tt>Devices</tt> section of <tt>XF86Config</tt>. These options will be 
described in the man page for your server, as well as in the various
files (such as <tt>README.cirrus</tt> or <tt>README.S3</tt>. These options
are enabled using the <tt>Option</tt> line. For example, the #9 GXE 64 
card requires two options:
<P><TT> <code>        Option &quot;number_nine&quot; </code><BR>
<code>        Option &quot;dac_8_bit&quot; </code>
 <P></TT>
Usually, the X server will work without these options, but they are
necessary to obtain the best performance. There are too many such options
to list here, and they each depend on the particular video card being
used. If you must use one of these options, fear not---the X server
man pages and various files in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</tt> will
tell you what they are.
<P>
So, when you're finished, you should end up with a <tt>Devices</tt>
section which looks something like this:
<P><TT> <code>Section &quot;Device&quot;  </code><BR>
<code>        # Device section for the #9 GXE 64 only</code> !<BR>
<code>        Identifier &quot;#9 GXE 64&quot; </code><BR>
<code>        Chipset &quot;mmio_928&quot; </code><BR>
<code>        ClockChip &quot;icd2061a&quot; </code><BR>
<code>        Option &quot;number_nine&quot; </code><BR>
<code>        Option &quot;dac_8_bit&quot; </code><BR>
<code>EndSection </code>
 <P></TT>
Most video cards will require a <tt>Clocks</tt> line, instead of 
<tt>ClockChip</tt>, as described above. The above <tt>Device</tt> entry
is only valid for a particular video card, the #9 GXE 64. It is 
given here only as an example.
<P>
There are other options that you can include in the <tt>Devices</tt> 
entry. Check the X server man pages for the gritty details, but the
above should suffice for most systems.
