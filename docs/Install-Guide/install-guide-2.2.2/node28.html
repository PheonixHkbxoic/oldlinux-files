A number of other advanced operating systems are on the rise
in the PC world. Specifically, IBM's OS/2 and Microsoft's Windows NT are
becoming very popular as more users move away from MS-DOS.
<P>
<A NAME=487>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=488>&#160;</A>
Both OS/2 and Windows NT are full multitasking operating systems, much like
Linux. Technically, OS/2, Windows NT, and Linux are quite similar: they
support roughly the same features in terms of user interface,
networking, security, and so forth. However, the real difference between Linux 
and The Other Guys is the fact that Linux is a version of UNIX, and hence 
benefits from the contributions of the UNIX community at large.
<P>
What makes UNIX so important? Not only is it the most popular operating 
system for multiuser machines, it is also the foundation for the
majority of the free software world. If you have access to the Internet, 
nearly all of the free software available there is written specifically
for UNIX systems. (The Internet itself is largely UNIX-based.)
<P>
There are many implementations of UNIX, from many vendors, and no single
organization is responsible for distribution.
There is a large push in the UNIX community for standardization in the form
of open systems, but no single corporation controls this design. 
Hence, any vendor (or, as it turns out, any hacker) may implement these 
standards in an implementation of UNIX.
<P>
OS/2 and Windows NT, on the other hand, are proprietary systems. The
interface and design are controlled by a single corporation,
and only that corporation may implement that design. (Don't expect to see
a free version of OS/2 anytime in the near future.) In one sense, this
kind of organization is beneficial: it sets a strict standard for the
programming and user interface unlike that found even in the open systems
community.  OS/2 is OS/2 wherever you go---the same holds for Windows NT.
<P>
However, the UNIX interface is constantly developing and changing. Several 
organizations are attempting to standardize the programming model,
but the task is very difficult. Linux, in particular, is mostly compliant with 
the POSIX.1 standard for the UNIX programming interface. As time goes on, 
it is expected that the system will adhere to other such standards, but 
standardization is not the primary issue in the Linux development community.
