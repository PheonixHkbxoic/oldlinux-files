As of XFree86 version 3.1, released in September 1994, the following video 
chipsets are supported. The documentation included with your video adaptor 
should specify the chipset used. If you are in the market for a new video
card, or are buying a new machine that comes with a video card, have the
vendor find out exactly what the make, model, and chipset of the video
card is. This may require the vendor to call technical support on your
behalf; in general vendors will be happy to do this. Many PC hardware vendors
will state that the video card is a ``standard SVGA card'' which ``should
work'' on your system. Explain that your software (mention Linux and XFree86!)
does not support all video chipsets and that you must have detailed 
information.
<P>
You can also determine your videocard chipset by running the <tt>
SuperProbe</tt> program included with the XFree86 distribution. This is
covered in more detail below.

</UL>
<P>
Video cards using these chipsets are supported on all bus types, including 
VLB and PCI.
<P>
All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with
the exception of the Avance Logic, MX and Video 7 chipsets, which are only
supported in 256 color mode. If your video card has enough DRAM installed,
many of the above chipsets are supported in 16 and 32 bits-per-pixel mode 
(specifically, some Mach32, P9000, S3 and Cirrus boards). The usual
configuration is 8 bits per pixel (that is, 256 colors).
<P>
The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, the Hercules 
monochrome card, the Hyundai HGC1280, Sigma LaserView, and Apollo monochrome 
cards. On the Compaq AVGA, only 64k of video memory is supported for the 
monochrome server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.
<P>
This list will undoubtedly expand as time passes. The release notes for the 
current version of XFree86 should contain the complete list of supported
video chipsets.
<P>
One problem faced by the XFree86 developers is that 
some video card manufacturers use non-standard mechanisms for determining
clock frequencies used to drive the card. Some of these manufacturers 
either don't release specifications describing how to program the card,
or they require developers to sign a non-disclosure statement to obtain
the information. This would obviously restrict the free distribution of
the XFree86 software, something that the XFree86 development team is
not willing to do. For a long time, this has been a problem with
certain video cards manufactured by Diamond, but as of release 3.1
of XFree86, Diamond has started to work with the development team to
release free drivers for these cards.
<P>
The suggested setup for XFree86 under Linux is a 486 machine with at least 
8 megabytes of RAM, and a video card with a chipset listed above. For 
optimal performance, we suggest using an accelerated card, such as an
S3-chipset card. You should check the documentation
for XFree86 and verify that your particular card is supported before
taking the plunge and purchasing expensive hardware. Benchmark ratings
comparisons for various video cards under XFree86 are posted routinely
to the USENET newsgroups <tt>comp.windows.x.i386unix</tt> and 
<tt>comp.os.linux.misc</tt>.
<P>
As a side note, my personal Linux system is a 486DX2-66, 20 megabytes of 
RAM, and is equipped with a VLB S3-864 chipset card with 2 megabytes of DRAM.
I have run X benchmarks on this machine as well as on Sun Sparc IPX 
workstations. The Linux system is roughly 7 times faster than the Sparc IPX
(for the curious, XFree86-3.1 under Linux, with this video card, runs
at around 171,000 xstones; the Sparc IPX at around 24,000). In general,
XFree86 on a Linux system with an accelerated SVGA card will give you
much greater performance than that found on commercial UNIX workstations
(which usually employ simple framebuffers for graphics).
<P>
<A NAME=5199>&#160;</A>
Your machine will need at least 4 megabytes of physical RAM, and 16 megabytes 
of virtual RAM (for example, 8 megs physical and 8 megs swap). 
Remember that the more physical RAM that you have, the less that the system 
will swap to and from disk when memory is low. Because swapping is inherently 
slow (disks are very slow compared to memory), having 8 megabytes of RAM or 
more is necessary to run XFree86 comfortably.
A system with 4 megabytes of physical RAM could run <em>much</em>
(up to 10 times) more slowly than one with 8 megs or more.
