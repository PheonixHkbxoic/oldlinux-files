Many distributions require you to create Linux partitions by hand using
the <tt>fdisk</tt> program. Others may automatically create partitions for
you. Either way, you should know the following information about
Linux partitions and device names.
<P>
Drives and partitions under Linux are given different names than their
counterparts under other operating systems. Under MS-DOS, floppy drives are 
referred to as 
<tt>A:</tt> and <tt>B:</tt>, while hard drive partitions are named <tt>C:</tt>, 
<tt>D:</tt>, and so on. Under Linux, the naming convention is quite 
different.
<P>
<b>Device drivers</b>, found in the directory <tt>/dev</tt>, are used to 
communicate with devices on your system (such as hard drives, mice, and so on).
For example, if you have a mouse on your system, you access it through the 
driver <tt>/dev/mouse</tt>. Floppy drives, hard drives, and individual partitions 
are all given individual device drivers of their own. Don't worry about 
the device driver interface for now; it is important only to understand how 
the various devices are named in order to use them.
<P>
Table <A HREF="node72.html#tablepartnames">2.1</A> lists the names of these various device drivers.

<P>
<P>
A few notes about this table. Note that <tt>/dev/fd0</tt> corresponds to the 
first floppy drive (<tt>A:</tt> under MS-DOS) and <tt>/dev/fd1</tt> corresponds to 
the second floppy (<tt>B:</tt>).
<P>
Also, SCSI hard drives are named differently than other drives. IDE, MFM,
and RLL drives are accessed through the devices <tt>/dev/hda</tt>, 
<tt>/dev/hdb</tt>, and
so on. The individual partitions on the drive <tt>/dev/hda</tt> are  
<tt>/dev/hda1</tt>, <tt>/dev/hda2</tt>, and so on. However, SCSI drives are named 
<tt>/dev/sda</tt>, <tt>/dev/sdb</tt>, etc., with partition names such as
<tt>/dev/sda1</tt> and <tt>/dev/sda2</tt>.
<P>
Here's an example. Let's say that you have a single IDE hard drive,
with 3 primary partitions. The first two are set aside for MS-DOS, and the
third is an extended partition which contains two logical partitions, both 
for use by Linux. The devices referring to these
partitions would be:

<P>
Note that <tt>/dev/hda4</tt> is skipped; it corresponds to the fourth
primary partition, which we don't have in this example.
Logical partitions are named consecutively starting with <tt>/dev/hda5</tt>.
