It's not uncommon to run both Linux and MS-DOS on the same system.
Many Linux users rely on MS-DOS for applications such as word processing. 
While Linux provides its own analogues for these applications (for 
example, <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img31.gif">), there are various reasons
why a particular user would want to run MS-DOS as well as Linux.
If your entire dissertation is written using WordPerfect
for MS-DOS, you may not be able to easily convert it to <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img32.gif"> or some other
format. There are many commercial applications for MS-DOS which aren't 
available for Linux, and there's no reason why you can't use both.
<P>
As you might know, MS-DOS does not fully utilize the functionality of the 
80386 and 80486 processors. On the other hand, Linux runs
completely in the processor's protected mode, and exploits all of the 
features of the processor. You can directly access all of your 
available memory (and beyond, using virtual RAM). Linux provides a 
complete UNIX interface not available under MS-DOS---developing and
porting UNIX applications under Linux is easily done, while under MS-DOS 
you are limited to a small subset of the UNIX programming functionality.
Because Linux is a true UNIX system, you do not have these limitations.
<P>
We could debate the pros and cons of MS-DOS and Linux for pages on end.
However, let it suffice to say that Linux and MS-DOS are completely
different entities. MS-DOS is inexpensive (compared to other commercial
operating systems), and has a strong foothold in the PC computing world.
No other operating system for the PC has reached the
level of popularity of MS-DOS---largely because the cost of these other 
operating systems is unapproachable to most personal computer users. Very 
few PC users can imagine spending $1000 or more on the operating system 
alone. Linux, however, is free, and you finally have the chance to decide.
<P>
We will allow you to make your own judgments of Linux and MS-DOS based on
your expectations and needs. Linux is not for everybody. If you have always
wanted to run a complete UNIX system at home, without the high cost of 
other UNIX implementations for the PC, Linux may be what you're looking for.
<P>
There are tools available to allow you to interact between Linux and MS-DOS. 
For example, it is easy to access MS-DOS files from Linux. There is also an
MS-DOS emulator available, which allows you to run many popular
MS-DOS applications. A Microsoft Windows emulator is currently under
development.
