UNIX is one of the most popular operating systems worldwide because of its
large support base and distribution. It was originally developed as a
multitasking system for minicomputers and mainframes in the mid-1970's, but 
has since grown to become one of the most widely used operating systems 
anywhere, despite its sometimes confusing interface and lack of central 
standardization.
<P>
<A NAME=150>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=151>&#160;</A>
The real reason for UNIX's popularity? Many hackers feel that UNIX is the
Right Thing---the One True Operating System. Hence, the development of Linux
by an expanding group of UNIX hackers who want to get their hands dirty with
their own system.
<P>
Versions of UNIX exist for many systems---ranging from personal computers 
to supercomputers such as the Cray Y-MP.
Most versions of UNIX for personal computers are quite expensive and 
cumbersome. At the time of this writing, a one-machine version of AT&amp;T's
System V for the 386 runs at about US$1500.
<P>
Linux is a freely distributable version of UNIX developed primarily by Linus
Torvalds <A NAME=tex2html6 HREF="footnode.html#170"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> 
<A NAME=153>&#160;</A>
at the University of 
Helsinki in Finland. Linux was developed with the help of many UNIX 
programmers and wizards across the Internet, allowing anyone with
enough know-how and gumption the ability to
develop and change the system.  The Linux kernel uses no code from AT&amp;T or
any other proprietary source, and much of the software available for Linux is
developed by the GNU project at the Free Software Foundation in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. However, programmers all over the world have
contributed to the growing pool of Linux software.
<P>
Linux was originally developed as a hobby project by Linus Torvalds. 
It was inspired by Minix, a small UNIX system developed by
Andy Tanenbaum, and
<A NAME=154>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=155>&#160;</A>
the first discussions about Linux were on the USENET newsgroup 
<tt>comp.os.minix</tt>. These discussions were concerned mostly with the 
development of a small, academic UNIX system for Minix users who wanted 
more.
<P>
The very early development of Linux was mostly dealing with the 
task-switching features of the 80386 protected-mode interface, all written
in assembly code. Linus writes, 
<blockquote> ``After that it was plain sailing: hairy coding still, but I had some devices, 
and debugging was easier.  I started using C at this stage, and it certainly 
speeds up developement. This is also when I start to get serious about my 
megalomaniac ideas to make `a better Minix than Minix'. I was hoping I'd be 
able to recompile <tt>gcc</tt> under Linux some day...
<P>
``Two months for basic setup, but then only slightly longer 
until I had a disk-driver (seriously buggy, but it happened to work on my 
machine) and a small filesystem.  That was about when I made 0.01 available 
[around late August of 1991]: it wasn't pretty, it had no floppy
driver, and it couldn't do much anything.  I don't think anybody ever
compiled that version.  But by then I was hooked, and didn't want to
stop until I could chuck out Minix.''
</blockquote>
<P>
No announcement was ever made for Linux version 0.01. The 0.01 sources
weren't even executable: they contained only the bare rudiments of the kernel
source, and assumed that you had access to a Minix machine to compile and
play with them.
<P>
On 5 October 1991, Linus announced the first ``official'' version of Linux,
version 0.02. At this point, Linus was able to run <tt>bash</tt> (the GNU
Bourne Again Shell) and <tt>gcc</tt> (the GNU C compiler), but not very much
else was working. Again, this was intended as a hacker's system. The primary
focus was kernel development---none of the issues of user support, 
documentation, distribution, and so on had even been addressed. Today, 
the Linux community still seems to treat these ergonomic issues as 
secondary to the ``real programming''---kernel development.
<P>
Linus wrote in <tt>comp.os.minix</tt>,
<blockquote> ``Do you pine for the nice days of Minix-1.1, when men were men and wrote
their own device drivers? Are you without a nice project and just dying
to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs? Are you
finding it frustrating when everything works on Minix? No more all-nighters 
to get a nifty program working? Then this post might be just
for you.
<P>
``As I mentioned a month ago, I'm working on a free version of a
Minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers.  It has finally reached the stage
where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want),
and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution.  It is
just version 0.02...but I've successfully
run <tt>bash</tt>, <tt>gcc</tt>, <tt>gnu-make</tt>, <tt>gnu-sed</tt>, 
<tt>compress</tt>, etc. under it.''
</blockquote>
<P>
After version 0.03, Linus bumped the version number up to 0.10, as more people
started to work on the system. After several further revisions, Linus 
increased the version number to 0.95, to reflect his expectation that the
system was ready for an ``official'' release very soon. (Generally, software
is not assigned the version number 1.0 until it is theoretically complete
or bug-free.) This was in March of 1992. Almost a year and a half later,
in late December of 1993, the Linux kernel was still at version 
0.99.pl14---asymptotically approaching 1.0. As of the time of this
writing, the current kernel version is 1.1 patchlevel 52, and 1.2 is
right around the corner.
<P>
Today, Linux is a complete UNIX clone, capable of running X Windows, TCP/IP, Emacs,
UUCP, mail and news software, you name it. Almost all of the major free 
software packages have been ported to Linux, and commercial software is 
becoming available.
Much more hardware is supported
than in original versions of the kernel.  Many people have executed benchmarks
on 80486 Linux systems and found them comparable with mid-range workstations
from Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment Corporation. Who would have ever
guessed that this ``little'' UNIX clone would have grown up to take on the
entire world of personal computing?
