You will undoubtedly require some degree of assistance during
your adventures in the Linux world. Even the most wizardly of UNIX wizards
occasionally is stumped by some quirk or feature of Linux, and it's important
to know how and where to find help when you need it.
<P>
<A NAME=655>&#160;</A>
The primary means of getting help in the Linux world are via Internet
mailing lists and USENET newsgroups, as discussed in 
Section <A HREF="node43.html#secintrosources">1.9</A>. If you don't have online access 
to these
sources, you might be able to find comparable Linux discussion forums on
other online services, such as on local BBS's, CompuServe, and so on.

A number of businesses are providing commercial support for Linux. This 
will allow you to pay a ``subscription fee'' which will allow you to call
the consultants for help with your Linux problems. 
Appendix <A HREF="node234.html#appvendornum">B</A> contains a list of Linux vendors, some of
which provide commercial support.
However, if you have access to USENET and Internet
mail, you may find the free support found there to be just as useful.
<P>
Keeping the following suggestions in mind will greatly improve your 
experiences with Linux and will guarantee you more success in finding help 
to your problems.
<P>
<em>Consult all available documentation...first!</em>
The first thing you should do when encountering a problem is consult the 
various sources of information listed in
Section <A HREF="node43.html#secintrosources">1.9</A> and 
Appendix <A HREF="node225.html#appsourcesnum">A</A>. These documents were laboriously written for 
people 
like you---people who need help with the Linux system. Even books written for 
UNIX in general are applicable to Linux, and you should take advantage of them. 
More than likely, you will find the answer to your problems somewhere in this 
documentation, as impossible as it may seem.
<P>
If you have access to USENET news or any of the Linux-related mailing lists,
be sure to actually <em>read</em> the information there before posting for
help with your problem. Many times, solutions to common problems are not
easy to find in documentation, and instead are well-covered in the newsgroups
and mailing lists devoted to Linux. If you only post to these groups, and
don't actually read them, you are asking for trouble.
<P>
<em>Learn to appreciate self-maintenance.</em>
In most cases, it is preferable to do as much independent research and
investigation into the problem as possible before seeking outside help.
After all, you asked for it, by running Linux in the first place! Remember 
that Linux is all about hacking and fixing problems yourself. It is not a 
commercial operating system, nor does it try to look like one. Hacking won't
kill you. In fact, it will teach you a great deal about the system to
investigate and solve problems yourself---maybe even enough to one day 
call yourself a Linux guru. Learn to appreciate the value of hacking the
system, and how to fix problems yourself. You can't expect to run a 
complete, homebrew Linux system without some degree of handiwork.
<P>
<em>Remain calm.</em>
It is vital to refrain from getting frustrated with the system, at all
costs. Nothing is earned by taking an axe---or worse, a powerful 
electromagnet---to your Linux system in a fit of anger. The authors have
found that a large punching bag or similar inanimate object is a wonderful
way to relieve the occasional stress attack. As Linux matures and distributions
become more reliable, we hope that this problem will go away. However, even
commercial UNIX implementations can be tricky at times. When all else fails,
sit back, take a few deep breaths, and go after the problem again when you
feel relaxed. Your mind and conscience will be clearer.
<P>
<em>Refrain from posting spuriously.</em>
<A NAME=667>&#160;</A>
Many people make the mistake of posting or mailing messages pleading
for help prematurely. When encountering a problem, do not---we repeat,
do <em>not</em>---rush immediately to your nearest terminal and post a
message to one of the Linux USENET newsgroups. Often, you will catch
your own mistake five minutes later and find yourself in the curious
situation of defending your own sanity in a public forum. Before posting
anything any of the Linux mailing lists or newsgroups, first attempt to
resolve the problem yourself and be absolutely certain what the problem
is. Does your system not respond when switched on? Perhaps the machine is
unplugged.
<P>
<em>If you do post for help, make it worthwhile.</em>
If all else fails, you may wish to post a message for help in any of the
number of electronic forums dedicated to Linux, such as USENET newsgroups
and mailing lists. When posting, remember that the people reading your
post are not there to help you. The network is not your personal consulting
service. Therefore, it is important to remain as polite, terse, and
informative as possible.
<P>
How can one accomplish this? First, you should include as much (relevant)
information about your system and your problem as possible. Posting the
simple request, ``I cannot seem to get e-mail to work'' will probably
get you nowhere unless you include information on your system, what software
you are using, what you have attempted to do so far and what the results were. 
When including technical information, it is usually a good idea to include
general information on the version(s) of your software (Linux kernel version,
for example), as well as a brief summary of your hardware configuration.
However, don't overdo it---including information on the brand and type of
monitor that you have probably is irrelevant if you're trying to configure 
networking software.
<P>
Secondly, remember that you need to make some attempt---however feeble---at
solving your problem before you go to the Net. If you have never attempted
to set up electronic mail, for instance, and first decide to ask folks on 
the Net how to go about doing it, you are making a big mistake. There are a 
number of documents available (see the Section <A HREF="node43.html#secintrosources">1.9</A>) 
on how to get started with many common tasks under Linux. The idea is 
to get as far
along as possible on your own and <em>then</em> ask for help if and when you
get stuck.
<P>
Also remember that the people reading your message, however helpful, may
occasionally get frustrated by seeing the same problem over and over again.
Be sure to actually read the Linux newsgroups and mailing lists before
posting your problems. Many times, the solution to your problem has been
discussed repeatedly, and all that's required to find it is to browse the 
current messages.
<P>
Lastly, when posting to electronic newsgroups and mailing lists, try to be
as polite as possible. It is much more effective and worthwhile to be
polite, direct, and informative---more people will be willing to help you
if you master a humble tone. To be sure, the flame war is an art form 
across many forms of electronic communication, but don't allow that to
preoccupy your and other people's time. Save the network undue wear and
tear by keeping bandwidth as low as possible, and by paying as much attention
to other sources of information which are available to you. The network
is an excellent way to get help with your Linux problems---but it is
important to know how to use the network <em>effectively</em>.
