Along with the feeling of power comes the tendency to do harm. This
is one of the grey areas of UNIX system administration, but everyone 
goes through it at some point in time. Most users of UNIX systems never
have the ability to wield this power---on university and business UNIX 
systems, only the highly-paid and highly-qualified system administrators ever
login as <tt>root</tt>. In fact, at many such institutions, the <tt>root</tt>
password is a highly guarded secret: it is treated as the Holy Grail of the
institution. A large amount of hubbub is made about logging in as <tt>root</tt>;
it is portrayed as a wise and fearsome power, given only to an exclusive
cabal.
<P>
This kind of attitude towards the <tt>root</tt> account is, quite simply, the
kind of thing which breeds malice and contempt. Because <tt>root</tt> is so
fluffed-up, when some users have their first opportunity to login as 
<tt>root</tt> (either on a Linux system or elsewhere), the tendency is to
use <tt>root</tt>'s privileges in a harmful manner. I have known so-called
``system administrators'' who read other user's mail, delete user's files
without warning, and generally behave like children when given such a
powerful ``toy''.
<P>
Because <tt>root</tt> has such privilege on the system, it takes a
certain amount of maturity and self-control to use the account as it 
was intended---to
run the system. There is an unspoken code of honor which exists between
the system administrator and the users on the system. How would you feel
if your system administrator was reading your e-mail or looking over your
files? There is still no strong legal precedent for electronic privacy on 
time-sharing computer systems. On UNIX systems, the <tt>root</tt> user has
the ability to forego all security and privacy mechanisms on the system.
It is important that the system administrator develop a trusting relationship
with the users on the system. I can't stress that enough.
