At this time, there are few published works specifically about Linux.
Most noteworthy are the books from the Linux Documentation
Project, a project carried out over the Internet to write and distribute
a bona fide set of ``manuals'' for Linux. These manuals are analogues to
the documentation sets available with commercial versions of UNIX: they
cover everything from installing Linux, to using and running the system,
programming, networking, kernel development, and more.

The Linux Documentation Project manuals are available via anonymous FTP from 
the Internet, as well as via mail order from several sources. 
Appendix <A HREF="node225.html#appsourcesnum">A</A> lists the manuals which are available and covers 
means of obtaining them in detail.
<P>
There are not many books specifically about Linux currently available.
However, there are a large number of books about UNIX in general which
are certainly applicable to Linux---as far as using and programming the
system is concerned, Linux does not differ greatly from other
implementations of UNIX. In short, almost
everything you want to know about using and programming Linux can be found
in sources meant for a general UNIX audience. In fact, this book is meant
to be complemented by the large library of UNIX books currently available;
here, we present the most important Linux-specific details and hope 
that you will look to other sources for more in-depth information.
<P>
Armed with a number of good books about using UNIX, as well as the book
you hold in your hands, you should be able to tackle just about anything.
Appendix <A HREF="node225.html#appsourcesnum">A</A> includes a list of highly-recommended UNIX books,
both for UNIX newcomers and UNIX wizards alike.
<P>
There is also a monthly magazine about Linux, called the <em>Linux Journal</em>.
It is distributed worldwide, and is an excellent way to keep in touch
with the many goings-on in the Linux community---especially if you do not
have access to USENET news (see below). See Appendix <A HREF="node225.html#appsourcesnum">A</A>
for information on subscribing to the <em>Linux Journal</em>.
