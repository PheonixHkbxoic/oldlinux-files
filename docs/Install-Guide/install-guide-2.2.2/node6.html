The Linux Documentation Project is a loose team of writers, proofreaders, 
and editors who are working on a set of definitive Linux manuals.
The overall coordinator of the project is
Matt Welsh, aided by Lars Wirzenius and Michael K. Johnson.
<P>
This manual is but one in a set of several being distributed
by the Linux Documentation Project, including a Linux User's Guide, System
Administrator's Guide, and Kernel Hacker's Guide. These manuals are all 
available in <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img2.gif"> source format and Postscript output for anonymous FTP
from <tt>sunsite.unc.edu</tt>, in the directory <tt>/pub/Linux/docs/LDP</tt>.
<P>
We encourage anyone with a penchant for writing or editing to join us in
improving Linux documentation. If you have Internet e-mail access, you can
join the <tt>DOC</tt> channel of the <tt>Linux-Activists</tt> mailing list by 
sending mail to

 <P></TT>
with the line
<P><TT> X-Mn-Admin: join DOC
 <P></TT> 
as the first line of the message body.
<P>
Feel free to get in touch with the author and coordinator of this manual if
you have questions, postcards, money, or ideas. Matt Welsh can be reached
