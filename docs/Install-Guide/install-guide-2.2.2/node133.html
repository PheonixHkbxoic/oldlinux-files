<b>Job control</b> is a feature provided by many shells (Bash and Tcsh
included) which allows you to control multiple running commands, or 
<b>jobs</b>, at once. Before we can delve much further, we need to talk
about <b>processes</b>.

Every time you run a program, you start what is known as a 
<em>process</em>---which is just a fancy name for a running program.
The command <tt>ps</tt> displays a list
of currently running processes. Here's an example:
<P><TT> /home/larry# <em>ps</em>
<PRE>  PID TT STAT  TIME COMMAND 
   24  3 S     0:03 (bash) 
  161  3 R     0:00 ps
</PRE>
/home/larry#
 <P></TT>
<A NAME=3390>&#160;</A>
The <tt>PID</tt> listed in the first column is the <b>process ID</b>,
a unique number given to every running process. The last column,
<tt>COMMAND</tt>, is the name of the running command. Here, we're only looking
at the processes which Larry is currently running<A NAME=tex2html629 HREF="footnode.html#3567"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>. These are <tt>bash</tt>
(Larry's shell), and the <tt>ps</tt> command itself. As you can see, 
<tt>bash</tt> is running concurrently with the <tt>ps</tt> command.
<tt>bash</tt> executed <tt>ps</tt> when Larry typed the command. After
<tt>ps</tt> is finished running (after the table of processes is displayed),
control is returned to the <tt>bash</tt> process, which displays the
prompt, ready for another command.

A running process is known as a <em>job</em> to the shell. The terms
<em>process</em> and <em>job</em> are interchangeable. However, a process
is usually referred to as a ``job'' when used in conjunction with <b>
job control</b>---a feature of the shell which allows you to switch between
several independent jobs.
<P>
In most cases users are only running a single job at a time---that
being whatever command they last typed to the shell. However, using job
control, you can run several jobs at once, switching between them as
needed. How might this be useful? Let's say that you're editing
a text file and need to suddenly interrupt your editing and do something
else. With job control, you can temporarily suspend the editor, 
and back at the shell prompt start to work on something else. When you're
done, you can start the editor back up, and be back where you
started, as if you never left the editor. This is just one example. There
are many practical uses for job control.
