Jobs can either be in the <b>foreground</b> or in the <b>background</b>.
There can only be one job in the foreground at any one time. The foreground
job is the job which you interact with---it receives input from the keyboard
and sends output to your screen. (Unless, of course, you have redirected
input or output, as described in Section <A HREF="node119.html#secplumbing">3.8</A>). On the other
hand, jobs in the background do not receive input from the terminal---in
general, they run along quietly without need for interaction.
<P>
Some jobs take a long time to finish, and don't do anything
interesting while they are running.  Compiling programs is one such
job, as is compressing a large file.  There's no reason why you
should sit around being bored while these jobs complete their tasks;
you can just run them in the background. While the jobs are running
in the background, you are free to run other programs.
<P>
<A NAME=3418>&#160;</A>
Jobs may also be <b>suspended</b>. A suspended job is a job that 
is not currently running, but is temporarily stopped. After you
suspend a job, you can tell the job to continue, in the foreground
or the background as needed. Resuming a suspended job will not change
the state of the job in any way---the job will continue to run where
it left off.

Note that suspending a job is not equal to <em>interrupting</em>
a job. When you interrupt a running process (by hitting your interrupt
key, which is usually <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img190.gif">)<A NAME=tex2html640 HREF="footnode.html#3568"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>, 
it kills the process, for good.
Once the job is killed, there's no hope of resuming it; you'll have
to re-run the command. Also note that some programs trap the interrupt,
so that hitting <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img192.gif"> won't immediately kill the job. This is to 
allow the program to perform any necessary cleanup operations before exiting.
In fact, some programs simply don't allow you to kill 
them with an interrupt at all.
