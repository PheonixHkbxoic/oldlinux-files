<P>
If you are installing Slackware, after creating partitions (and
possibly swap space), use the command
<P><TT> # <em>setup</em>
 <P></TT>
This will present you will a menu-based procedure
to walk you through the remaining steps of installation.
<P>
The procedure described here corresponds to that found on
the <tt>color144</tt> and <tt>colrlite</tt> root disks; the other
root disks may have slightly different procedures.
<P>
The <tt>setup</tt> menu consists of the following items. Use the
arrow keys to move over the items, and press <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img66.gif"> or
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img67.gif"> to select an item.
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>Help</tt>
<DD> 
View the <tt>setup</tt> help file.
<P>
<DT><tt>Keymap</tt>
<DD>
This option allows you to specify the keyboard mapping for your
system if you do not have a US keyboard. A list of keymaps will
be presented; select the appropriate item from the list.
<P>
<DT><tt>Quick</tt>
<DD>
This allows you to select between ``quick'' and ``verbose'' 
installation modes. ``Verbose'' is the default, and is recommended
for most installations (unless you've installed Slackware 
a dozen times, in which case you already know this).
<P>
<DT><tt>Make tags</tt>
<DD>
This allows Slackware installation experts to create customized
``tag files'' for preselecting packages. This is only necessary
for customizing the installation procedure in some way; you shouldn't
have to concern yourself with this.
<P>
<DT><tt>Addswap</tt>
<DD>
This will be the first item that most users will select to
install Slackware. A list of available swap partitions will
be displayed (those partitions with type ``Linux swap'' as
set in <tt>fdisk</tt>). You will be able to specify which 
partitions you wish to use for swap space. You will then
be asked if you wish to run <tt>mkswap</tt> on these partitions.
<P>
If you have already executed <tt>mkswap</tt> and <tt>swapon</tt>
(as described in Section <A HREF="node74.html#secinstalllinuxmkswap">2.3.4</A>)
on your swap partitions, then you should <em>not</em> allow
<tt>setup</tt> to execute <tt>mkswap</tt> on these partitions.
<P>
Even if you have already executed <tt>mkswap</tt> and <tt>swapon</tt>,
it is necessary to use the <tt>Addswap</tt> menu item: This
ensures that your swap partitions will be available once you
have the system installed.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="(WARN)" SRC="bdt.gif">Be warned! Creating swap space on a partition will 
destroy data on that partition. Be sure that you're not wiping
out data that you want to keep.
<P>
If you select this menu item, you will be automatically
prompted if you wish to proceed with the following items.
In general, you should do this.
<P>
<DT><tt>Target</tt>
<DD> 
This item allows you to specify the partitions upon which 
Linux is to be installed. A list of available partitions
(those with type ``Linux native'', as specified by 
<tt>fdisk</tt>) will be displayed, and you will be asked to
enter the name of your Linux root partition, such as
<tt>/dev/hda2</tt>. You will then be prompted for the 
type of filesystem that you wish to create; we suggest
using the <tt>ext2fs</tt> filesystem type as described in
Section <A HREF="node75.html#secinstalllinuxmkfs">2.3.5</A>. This will 
create a filesystem on the named partition---somewhat
analogous to ``formatting'' the partition under MS-DOS.
<P>
You will also be prompted for any other partitions
that you might wish to use for Linux. For example, if you
created a separate partition for <tt>/usr</tt> (see
Section <A HREF="node68.html#secinstalllinuxreqs">2.2.3</A>), you will be 
able to specify the name of the partition and the location
where it should be mounted (as in <tt>/usr</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin</tt>).
<P>
 Be warned! Creating a filesystem on a partition will
destroy all data on that partition. Be sure that you're
not wiping out data that you want to keep.
<P>
Even if you already created your filesystems using <tt>mke2fs</tt> 
(see Section <A HREF="node75.html#secinstalllinuxmkfs">2.3.5</A>), you must use the
<tt>Target</tt> menu item to specify the partitions where Linux
will be installed.
<P>
<DT><tt>Source</tt>
<DD>
This menu item allows you to specify where you will be
installing Slackware from, such as floppy, hard drive,
or CD-ROM.
<P>
If you are installing from hard drive, you will be asked
what partition the Slackware files are found on, as well
as the type of partition. For example, if you have the
Slackware files on an MS-DOS partition, enter the name
of the partition (such as <tt>/dev/hda1</tt>) and select
<tt>MS-DOS FAT</tt> as the type. You will then be asked what
directory the files may be found under on this partition.
For example, if you have the Slackware files stored
under the directory <tt>C:<code>\</code>SLACK</tt> on your
MS-DOS partition, enter 
<P><TT> /slack
 <P></TT>
as the location. Note that you should use forward
slashes, not backslashes, in the pathname.
<P>
If you are installing from CD-ROM, you will be
asked the type of CD-ROM device that you are using,
as well as what directory on the CD-ROM the files
may be found in. Many CD-ROMs have the files 
contained within the directory <tt>/slakware</tt>,
but this depends on the release.
<P>
If you are installing Slackware Professional,<A NAME=tex2html282 HREF="footnode.html#1464"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> two directories are used on the
CD-ROM. <tt>slakware</tt> is used for the standard system
which will install the files directly to your hard drive.
<tt>slackpro</tt> is used for the CD-ROM-based system where
many files are accessed directly from the CD-ROM. This
can save diskspace, but accessing many files is also
noticeably slower. Several other Slackware vendors provide
the ability to run the software from the CD-ROM as well.
However, if you have the diskspace to spare, we recommend not 
running Slackware from the CD-ROM itself. Performance is generally
slower.
<P>
If you are attempting a hard drive or CD-ROM install, Slackware may 
report that there is a <tt>mount</tt> error at this point. This is usually 
an indication that there was a problem accessing the hard drive or 
CD-ROM. See Section <A HREF="node87.html#secinstallprobsinstall">2.5.3</A> for more information 
if you see such an error message.
<P>
<DT><tt>Disk sets</tt>
<DD>
This menu option allows you to select the disk sets that you
wish to install. You must install at least the <tt>A</tt> disk
set. Simply use the arrow keys and spacebar to select which
disk sets you wish to install.
<P>
Note that selecting a particular disk set does not mean that all 
packages on the disk set will be installed; you will be
prompted before installing packages on the disk set marked as 
``optional'' or ``recommended.''
<P>
<DT><tt>Install</tt>
<DD>
<P>
At long last, this menu item will install the software on your
system. You will be prompted for the prompting method; most
users should select ``normal.'' For each disk set that you
selected, the ``required'' packages will be installed, and
you will be prompted when installing the ``optional'' and
``recommended'' packages. If you are installing from
floppy you will be asked to insert each floppy in succession.
<P>
As each package is installed a short description will be
printed. Unless you have background in UNIX or Linux, many
of these descriptions will not mean much to you. Take note
of which packages are being installed, so you know what's
there, but don't worry about trying to jot down everything
that's printed on the display.
<P>
The most common error encountered here is that a file cannot
be found on a floppy, or an I/O error when attempting to
read the floppy. The former is an indication that the files on 
your floppy might be corrupted or incomplete; the latter that
the floppy itself is bad. Any floppies which give these
errors should be replaced, and you should re-install the disk
set containing those floppies. See 
Section <A HREF="node87.html#secinstallprobsinstall">2.5.3</A> for suggestions.
<P>
You may also have read errors when attempting to access a
CD-ROM; be sure that the CD-ROM is clean, has no fingerprints, etc.
<P>
<DT><tt>Configure</tt>
<DD>
<P>
This menu item performs some post-installation configuration of
your system. This is covered in the following section.
