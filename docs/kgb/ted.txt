A quick scan using Archie shows that none of the FTP sites for Linux
that it knows about are on the U.S. side of the Atlantic.  In the hopes
of reducing inter-atlantic traffic and reducing the load on
nic.funet.fi, I've made Linux-0.10 available for anonymous FTP on
TSX-11.MIT.EDU (18.172.1.2).  I will make an attempt to keeps things
reasonably current.

I've just recently heard about Linux from the Hurd mailing list, and
from looking at the source code it looks very, very exciting.  I haven't
managed to install it on my hard disk yet (it looks like I'll need to
blow away OS/2 in order to reclaim one of the four primary partitions
--- shucks), but just from looking at the source code there are a bunch
of things which look like interesting projects --- like supporting DOS
extended partitions and multiple threads per task.  Now, all I need to
do is find some time to do some playing....  :-)
