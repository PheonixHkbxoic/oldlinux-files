Try looking on sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/system/Network. IF
you poke around down there you should be able to find it. Alternatively,
get the INDEX.whole or 00-find.linux and grep for 2000.

Sorry this isn't a better reference, but I'm at work and can't get to sunsite
from here :-(

Try sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/X11/xapps

I just compiled rzsz9202 from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/apps/comm, and
got it to work fine by changing a line that read 'open("/dev/tty" ...' to
open /dev/ttys1 instead (the line should be in rbsb.c, but I'd grep
all of the c stuff for /dev/tty to be sure). Now I can just ctrl-z out
of kermit and type "rz" and everything's happy as a clam.

Btw, there are some rzsz patches in /pub/Linux/apps/comm, but I haven't  
looked to see what they patch. Those may be the same ones referred to
above.

Look at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/apps/math. It should be in there. If
not, grep 00-find.Linux for "spice".

First of all, yes there is one. Secondly, sunsite.unc.edu has it. I just
don't remember quite where it is (as I downloaded it last night though, I
probably should). Look in /pub/Linux/apps/graphics or /pub/Linux/graphics.
If that doesn't help, grep for "pbm" in 00-find.Linux - the viewer is one
directory underneath pbm. If you still can't find it, send a note to me
at ewt@sunsite.unc.edu and I'll find it for you.

Sorry for not being more specific,

Erik
