Having downloaded the SLS release (0.98.1), I find that although I define 
/dev/sda4 of my scsi drive as a swap space and indead when the kernel boots
I have the helpful message that the 8 Meg swap space is being added, I find
that the 'free' command doesn't find the swap device at all 'free -s'
returns 'swap: No swap device' and swapon -a reports that /dev/sda4 is
already busy / mounted (presuably as a swap area)

Having read through the FAQ supplied in the release I found nothing to
indicate any flags that might have been needed in /etc/fstab

/dev/sda4       none    swap   <???flags???>

I then thougt that this might be a case of recompile the kernel and run ps -U
again but 25 min later and the same problem,.... the kernel reports that it is 
adding the swap space and free refuses to believe that I have, which is telling
the truth?.

I was in the middle of downloading ps-0.98.tar.Z from sunsite when my network
went down for nightly backups (pah) so I haven't recompiled the memory utils

does anyone spot where I've gone wrong?
