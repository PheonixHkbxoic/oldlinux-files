But! Other's do need a nice clean journal. They don't have Usenet.

The whole world isn't on internet. Any effort that can be made that doesn't
cost ME or YOU anything is a good idea. Don't discourage anyone from 
spreading the word about linux. Think about all of those poor lost souls
who still see "C>" when they turn on their machines.

Sad, isn't it?

I'm having that problem too! I've been running pl 7 before I bought
my no-name 16550C card, and have reapeating characters intermittantly.

Just wanted to make sure everyone heard about Bill Gates latest announcement
concerning Windows NT. Apparently it won't ship before August 1st, will
nedd at least 16mb of RAM (more for servers), and will be priced around
$500 for the non-server version. He even said that if you don't know why
you want NT, you probably don't want NT.

Thank you Linus for saving us all from this. My 4 MB 25 MHz 386 has never

sunsite.unc.edu has a mailserver of its very own. To use it, send mail to

In response to your next question, I'm pretty sure that sunsite does indeed
have every tcp bell and ip whistle that exists. jem likes to play :-)

Let me know if you have any problems,

Now LINUX, please.  I've already abandoned OS/2, having found that it is
not (yet) a true 32-bit protected mode system (I know, 32-bits apps, but
that is not what I am taking about).

Not true.  This is apparently the specs that CMS wants you to think you
need.  The "need" in this case seems to be that on the part of CMS; THEY
need for us porgrammers to go hide somewhere and quit trying to make
better software.  Every time I hear that from them, it makes me SICK!
I have the QIC specs.  Ain't in there.

Please don't baby me.  Some of us a very good programmers that can
understand complex subjects, and even understand hardware.  So they
are long and terse.  That's only a sign of poor documentation anyway.
I know the parallel port problem is not simple.  It is difficult in
part because the original design didn't expect it to be used for this.
But then we can find tons of really bad designs in the PC architecture
that people found working solutions around.

All the more reason to open the specs.  Third party software developers
might well surprise you in how innovative they can be.


I believe a possible solution here is for the QIC group to adopt a
standard for operating over the parallel interface.  This standard
really should be one that is very universal.  It should not be
specific to tape backup units, but rather, it should be one that
will allow software on the PC, and hardware on the other side of
the interface that plugs into the PC, to have a reliable and simple
communications path.  Then on top of that (an interface circuit and
a driver on the PC) you can put any kind of connection application
you want, like a backup tape.

Then another standard should exist for how to command a tape backup
unit through the above reliable simple raw data path.  It should be
workable as a modular standard, usable for tapes supporting any of
the other QIC recording formats and data formats.

Very. I've been running the ext fs for months w/o a problem. I've heard
ext2 and xiafs are fine too. Minix is extremely reliable as well, but 
fairly braindead.

It will kill the parition is no time flat. Of course, I'd be suprised
if you could ever convince one to run on a non-dos parition anyway. If
you do manage to somehow, report it to the company who made it
immediately. It really should no better.

Many good fs do need de-fragmentors. Linux has one, and it's on
sunsite (and I'm sure it's on other places as well).

If you're running dos, you can just turn it off. No problems.

Not very accessible at all. The best way of moving a linux file to
dos is to boot linux and "cp file /dos". Shutdown, and then boot dos.
It'll be there when you get there.

I don't know - 30 meg maybe. Somewhere around there anyway. Note that
if you do the installation by hand it'll be significantly smaller then
the equivalent SLS installation (as SLS is VERY complete).

Parallel or Serial. Standard lp commands are available. The only drivers

do some of it, and GhostScript can probably do the rest.

Kermit (my favorite), Minicom, pcomm. You didn't mention X anywhere
in this, so I'll assume you don't want to run X ones (though the comm
progs for X are supposed to be much better)

MCA doesn't work. At all. Don't try it. EISA and local bus should though.
For non-X stuff, and standard VGA card should work fine. If you don't want
graphics at all, any EGA/VGA/MDA card works.

I'm having this problem. Looking at the chip tells me its a 16550C, and
the kernel tells me its a 16550A at bootup.

Incredible. I just removed sccs from sunsite, get to work, fire up my 
newsreader for the first time since Friday, and there is a nice long thread
on SCCS.

A note from a concerned citizen prompted me to take a look at the sccs
distribution on sunsite (which was where jem said above). The source code
has *no* copyright information, even though one file (sccs.c) that I looked
at had an RCS tag indicating it was from UCB 4.2. As I have never seen
and legitimate bsd source code without a copyright notice, this made me a
little nervous.

Then I looked at the README, which said this as a port of sccs to linux
be PALMC (People Against Large Multinational Corporations), and the
port was done by "Bart", who apparently has no e-mail address.

Finally, I looked at the Makefile, which mentioned System III, but also
had no copyright.

These observations and my own knowledge that SCCS was oringally written
at AT&T and was thus owned by them prompted my to remove sccs from sunsite's
archives this morning. If anyone has 

   a) A freely available version of sccs or
   b) Knowledge as to where this one came from

Please let me know so I can resolve that problem. Until I get more information,
sccs will no longer be available on sunsite.

Please direct all replies and flames to email at ewt@sunsite.unc.edu.

PS: To all potential uploaders of (C) stuff: While I support linux as strongly

   I'm having this problem. Looking at the chip tells me its a 16550C, and
   the kernel tells me its a 16550A at bootup.

Don't worry about it.  There are no real functional differences between
the NS16550A, the NS16550AF, the PC16550, and the PC16550C --- indeed, I
don't believe there is a software method for distinguishing between
them.  The only real thing that is at all important is distinguishing
between these three cases:

        *) NS8250 UART's (don't have a scratch register, don't have FIFO)
        *) NS16450/NS16550 UART's  (don't have a FIFO -- or a working FIFO)
        *) NS16550A/NS16550AF,PC16550,PC16550C (has a working FIFO).

And all Linux cares about is whether or not the chip has a working FIFO
or not --- if it does, it will print that it has a 16550A; otherwise, it
will print that it has detected a 16550 or a 16450.

Note: there are actually very few NS16550's out there --- they were only
produced for a few months before National Semiconductor realized there
was a bug in a chip, and quickly fixed it.  Most of them are in the
first generation PS/2's, which means most Linuxer's probably won't run
into them.

One thing that is confusing is that there are other chip manufacturers
other than National Semiconductor making 16550A compatible UART's.  So
just because the chip says "16550" doesn't necessarily mean that you
can't use its FIFO's --- take a look at what the kernel says.  If the
kernel detects a 16550A, you can probably trust its FIFO's.
