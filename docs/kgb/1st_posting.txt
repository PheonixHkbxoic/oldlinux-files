I scanned this newsgroup, and while I found a few people asking the
same questions I'm about to ask, there were no real answers (probably
because most asked for email responses).

I want to get a SCSI tape drive (QIC-150 or QIC-250) that supports
reading and writing 150 meg tapes. I will be exchanging between Linux
and other UNIX workstations (the tapes are the 6150, 6250 kind, approximate
dimentions are 4x6x1). It would be real nice if the same drive supported 250
meg tapes also.

Cost must be <= about $800. ARCHIVE VIPERS tend to be very expensive.
I've seen WANGTEK mentioned. Could anyone offer information, advice,
suggestions, etc?

Also, I already have a CIPHER 150 meg SCSI tape drive. Could I get this
to work with LINUX? DOS? If so, how?

I'd also like to ensure (as best as possible) that the drive also
works with Windows-NT and DOS.


Please email me at the address below. If I get enough information, I'll
post a summary.


I think we need a TAPE DRIVE FAQ. :-)

Thanks!!!

P.S. The drive will be used on a modern ADAPTEC controller

   I want to get a SCSI tape drive (QIC-150 or QIC-250) that supports
   reading and writing 150 meg tapes. I will be exchanging between Linux
   and other UNIX workstations (the tapes are the 6150, 6250 kind, approximate
   dimentions are 4x6x1). It would be real nice if the same drive supported 250

A drive which support QIC-150 tapes will also support the 6250 tapes ---
the format is the same, just the tape is longer.

I've found refurbished, or new-but-taken-out-of-PS/2 Tandburg 3660 tape
drives at PC computer trade shows for $150-$175.  They're not "new", but
most of them either haven't been used much if at all.  The one catch is
that your warranty is whatever the salvage dealer is willing to give
you.  I got a 60 day warranty with mine.  It worked perfectly the first
time I hooked it up to my Adaptec 1542B.  (Ironic, isn't it?  The
controller ended up costing me more than the tape drive!  :-)

These PC computer trade shows run approximately once a month in the
Boston area, and there are usually several salvage dealers that show up
at these shows.  If you're in the Boston area, and you want to find out
when the next one of these shows are; let me know.  The next time I get
a postcard from these folks, I'll send you email.....
