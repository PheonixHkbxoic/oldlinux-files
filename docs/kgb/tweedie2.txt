That should work, but if it doesn't, you're stuck unable to get a
virtual console.  I run xdm from the inittab on /dev/tty1, and run a
normal getty on /dev/tty2, so that if X fails I can always fall back
to a console login.  From my /etc/inittab...

tty1:xterm:/bin/doshell /dev/tty1 /usr/X386/bin/xdm 
tty2:console:/bin/getty 19200 tty2
ttys1:bbcb32:/etc/getty -m 19200,9600 ttys1

PS.  Is this in the FAQ yet?

First of all, you should be using the -p (set permissions) option to
tar; although if you say the mode bits are correct, you're probably
doing this anyway.

The problem with ownership is that when you boot from the root floppy,
you are no longer using the passwd and group files from your tarred
root partition.  So, all those users and groups who should own the
files you are restoring simply don't exist at the time of the restore.
You should copy the original /etc/passwd and /etc/group files into
/etc on the root floppy before extracting the tar archive.
