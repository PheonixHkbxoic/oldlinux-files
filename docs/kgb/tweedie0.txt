The "magic match failed" message is issued by the kernel when it tries
to mount a file system and cannot find the correct header information
for that file system on the block device.

When Linux mounts the root partition, it tries to look for all the
different possible file system types on the partition in the order
minix, extfs, dosfs.  It does this by trying to mount the different
types in that order, until one of the mounts succeeds.  The messages
you describe means that linux has mounted a DOS filing system as root
--- the two magic match failures mean that linux has failed to find a
minix or an extfs file system, and the rest of the blurb is the
standard information printed out whenever linux mounts a dos file
system.

I'm not familiar with SLS --- I started out with mcc-interim --- but I
suspect that your rawritten disk should NOT have a dos file system on
it; mounting a dos file system as root is legal, but probably not what
was intended.  Rawrite should be able to create a valid minix disk,
completely overwriting the dos information formatted onto it by the
dos format command.  Your best bet might be to download the a2 disk
again.  Then again, I might be talking garbage... Your mileage may
vary.

Good luck anyway - Who said Linux was the best thing since sliced
bread?  Sliced bread doesn't even come close!

Cheers,
