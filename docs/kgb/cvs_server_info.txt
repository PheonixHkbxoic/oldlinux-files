CVS Server Setup
==========================


creating a local repository

	export CVSROOT=/path/to/where/cvs/is
	cvs init


Creating a module

	cvs import -m "commit message here" path_to_module module_name start

	ie, for a dir called shell_scripts
	
	cd shell_scripts
	cvs import -m "importing shell scripts" shell_scripts shell_scripts start

	
Checking out that module to work on it.

	If you are importing something that already exists, you probably
want to import it, then check it out again. This will check out the
source with all the appropriate control files and whatnot. So, make sure
you cp/mv the original before you check it out again.

	mv shell_scripts shell_scripts.orig
	cvs checkout shell_scripts

	This will checkout (download) all the files currently
in that module of cvs. 

	Whee!



Remote server setup

	There are two basic methods, rsh/ssh, and pserver. For most
Open Source projects, pserver seems pretty popular, but for cases
where confidentially is needed, the ssh method is probably preferred.

 rsh/ssh

	The advantage here is the possibility to use ssh, and the 
the lack of a need to run a cvs server constantly.

	The only trick is that the client needs to exist on the server,
and be able to login it normally. This is the primary disadvantage to this
setup. 


pserver

	Pserver setup uses a different passwd file than standard logins,
so it is possible to give people login access to a cvs server without
any shell or login privilege. 

	The hard part is you create the repo, then add any user entries
to $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd in the form:

username:passwd_string:user_to_run_as

passwd_string is the crypt()'ed passwd, not the plain text passwd.

an easy way to do this is:

	 perl -e "print crypt('passwd','a_salt_string');"


Probably want to create a user for cvs particularly. 

You also need to add the cvs pserver line to /etc/inetd.conf:

2401  stream  tcp  nowait  cvs  /usr/bin/cvs cvs --allow-root=/path/to/cvsroot pserver

Generally want to setup a cvs user, and a chroot environment for running
cvs in. Start with the one for FTP, and work from there.
