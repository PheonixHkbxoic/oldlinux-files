I suggest creating a newsgroup dedicated to only bug reporting
(comp.os.linux.bugs}. This was highly successful in the alt.sys.amiga.uucp
groups. The advantages are obvious

        Bugs and soluations are seen by everyone who needs to.

        Newsgroup extraction can be automated; news posts could have a specific
        format.

        Traffic is moved away from the main newsgroup

        The newsgroup could be moderated if desired.

        Inappropriate items, or items that are really FAQs are still visible.

I would *strongly* second this motion.

Another (major) advantage to the new group - it would help to keep the
volume on the Linux-activists mail channels under control, so that
they could be more useful as channels for development discussion as
originally intended, not as help forums as they currently seem to be
heading.

Can anybody remember when the last split was voted?  I think that the
6-month limit between split votes is due to expire pretty soon.

Cheers,
 Stephen Tweedie.
