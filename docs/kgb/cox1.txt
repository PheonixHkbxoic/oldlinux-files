KA9Q uses a hosts.net file in its current directory for FTP and handles
mail in a totally non-unix way. I've mailed the maintainer of the program
with the changes to 
        a) make finger work (executes a bsd finger program)
        b) fix incoming/outgoing email
        c) fix incoming telnet ( the telunix code)
        
I've not heard from him since so I don't know if they all got through. Im
also going away for a bit so I won't be able to mail you the patches for
a while.

Some pointers:
        smtp mail is almost right, just add a bit of code to check the
username exists (with getpwnam()) and generate mailbox paths as /usr/mail/<id>
with the right owner/groups and smtp works.

        telunix has a set of problems. Firstly the program assumes sys5.2
rather than posix and regards a -1 from a nonblocking read as an error.
Add a check that makes error of -1 and errno=EAGAIN map to a 0 read and
it will work for line mode.
        The second problem is a combination of errors in the telnet processor
and options not sent. Make telnet.c simply ignore the WILL ECHO sequence
and use sendmsg to send IAC DO ECHO IAC DONT SGA at the start of an incoming
telnet to kick the machine into character mode.
        Although I tried setting the tty options to get the carriage return
mapping to work I was forced to munge all cr/lf codes about to get
returns to work properly.

Oh in addition it doesn't spawn logins like bsd telnetd instead you need
to have them sitting on pty's read - just add /dev/ttyp0 /dev/ttyp1 and
/dev/ttyp2 to your /etc/inittab
