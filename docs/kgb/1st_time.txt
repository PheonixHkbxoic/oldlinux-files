OK, I Finally got around to trying out Linux (TAMU).
First, let me say that Linux looks GREAT! Can't believe it's free. Easy
to use (well, as easy as any unix is). I'm excited by the possibilities.
I LOVE the fact I can mount my msdos partition and xfer files, and X.
Nice work!

However, I have MANY problems, some of them major. I realize I'm
behind in release version, and I will try to upgrade asap, but I'd
like to know if anyone has seen these, or if there are solutions.
Some of these problems are bigtime show stoppers for me, as I require
UUCP and bi-modem communications to work.


Minor problems first --

    1. Is there ANY way to change this tiny font being displayed? It's much
       too small.
       

    2. What's this "MINIX-fs magic match failure" message that appears on
       every startup? The whole system seems fine, including all 3 partitions
       and files systems. efsck doesn't clear it either. I suspect it's some
       dumb script trying to do something and getting a partition type wrong.
       I get a similar error if I use fsck instead of efsck.
       

    3. Are there any non-Xwindows programs to enable/disable audio CD's?
    

    4. No BRU. I like tar, but I wish I had both. I encounter systems that
       do have BRU and not TAR.
       

    5. To keep the system reliable (especially on a pwer failure reboot),
       I included an execution of efsck in my startup. Is there a way for
       rc.local to "determine" if this is needed rather than always
       doing it?
       

    6. I can't get XDM to work. It's flaky, and the few times I actually got
       the login screen to come up, it wouldn't take input.
       

    7.  It took me a while to figure out that uucp and news didn't come with
        sample files for everything that's needed. "Dialers", "newsgroups",
        and a few others were missing. Also, there was no sample entry in
        Devices for an ACU.
        
        I eventually resolved these.
        


OK, now on to the major things I REALLY could use help with. Right now,
these stop me from using the system at all.


    8.  I can't get mail to function correctly on the local system. I can
        send mail to myself, but when I send to a user that has forwarding
        on (in their mail file), the letter seems to vanish. If I set root
        up as forwarded and send mai lto it, the end-user (and root) can't
        receive it. When I send to an external site -- same thing.
        
        I can't locate it anyway (files, queues, etc.), and can't find a
        log record of it's failure.
        

    9.  mail is getting a dummy domain suffix from somewhere - I can't
        figure it out. It's something like "myorg.mydomain"
        

    10  If I set getty up on the serial port, and attempt to use kermit to
        make an outgoing interative connection, getty is still in the way
        and modem responses cause an inifinate "login" attempt loop.
        
        Trying uugetty did the same thing (and curiously, uugetty doesn't
        support standard switches).
        
        What do I do about this? How does one set up a bi-directional modem
        port? I though uugetty would be the way, but it doesn't even know
        "-r".
        

    11. There doesn't seem to be any flavor of a "mailsurr" on the system.
        Why? How does one set up a default and "SMARTER HOST" addressing?
        

    12. uucico and uuxqt core dump on me. I can't get them to run at all.
        I don't know what to do about this. Anyone else getting this?


Is there anyway to still use VC's while X windows is up? It seems to
be an exclusive choice.
        


Thanks! I hope there are answers.
