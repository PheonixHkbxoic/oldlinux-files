        Linux: Because sources are fun
        Linux: Because a PC is a terrible thing to waste
        Linux: It's not just an OS, it's an adventure
        Linux: Why ask why?
        Linux: Because the 3267th U*IX system HAS to be good
        Linux: 2 user license? get out of my face.
        Linux: All this and sources too.
        Linux: Free? Sources? Posix? Pinch me, I'm dreaming.
        Linux: Now you can format a floppy AND do something else.
        Linux: You don't understand, do you?

        I have a license for my car and dog, I DIDN'T want one for my
        *IX system.

        Linux: Comercial software gone horribly wrong


        Top 11 reasons why I use Linux:

        11. Can't claim it's "new and improved" because it hasn't been
            released yet.

        10. Having source code helps justify getting larger disk drives.

         9. Now that 3rd user can log into my system? Pinch me - I
            must be dreaming.

         8. Sounds like a Peanuts character

         7. A new release every 2 weeks really impresses the babes.
            (well; hacker babes anyway).

         6. Now I can spend my money on food instead - or maybe a tape
            drive.

         5. Who are you gonna trust? USL/Novel, SCO, OSF, or 1000+ socially
            impaired strangers scattered around the globe communicating
            solely by electronic mail?

         4. Another excuse for a cool t-shirt!

         3. I sleep better at nights knowing that the Amiga port won't
            strand millions of users who already have enough reasons
            to maime everyone at CBM.

         2. Linux? I thought you said Lexus.

         1. Sources? Free? - 'nuff said.

            

How about the Linux foundation invent an animal logo also?
