-- February 8 Erik Troan ``This is a list (and short
description)  of all of the stuff
that's been moved out of pub/Linux/Incoming on sunsite.unc.edu
in the past 10 days. If the description is wrong, please let me
(ewt@sunsite.unc.edu) know asap as this is the same description that
goes in the INDEX file.
I'm going to try to get these things out weekly to semi-weekly, but
sunsite is a mess, so it may take me a while to get on a regular schedule.

-- February 9 Linus sez: 
``Only complete newbies don't know what this is all about, but I'd better
tell you anyway: patchlevel 5 of the 0.99 kernel is now available on
nic.funet.fi (pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus) as both context diffs against
pl4 and complete source code.  I'm not even going to speculate on 1.0
right now. 

The pl5 diffs are about 90kB compressed: the major changes are to the
tcp/ip code and the serial driver, while there are various minor fixes
strewn around the system:

 - serial lines/tty changes (tytso & Fred v Kempen)
 - NFS bugfixes (Rick Sladkey)
 - tcp/ip (Ross Biro)
 - coprocessor handling changes (me)
 - harddisk driver error handling (Mika Liljeberg)
 - various minor patches (me and others)

Serial lines now implement non-blocking opens correctly and support
dial-out lines (same minor, major .eq 5).  I changed the default startup
mode to be CLOCAL so that people won't get confused by the modem line
code when not using dial-in. 

Another interesting change is the 387 error-coupling tests at bootup:
the code to check if the intel-recommended exception 16 error reporting
is present is non-obvious.  If you have had problems with coprocessor
error handling, or have a non-intel coprocessor, I'd suggest you test
this out: I'd like to hear about problems/successes. 
PS.  If you tested out the latest ALPHA-diffs (the ones that already
changed the kernel version to pl5), the changes to the final pl5 were
only cosmetic.
