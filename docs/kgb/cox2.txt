Linux already supports a single user boot mode. You stick the right 
statements EARLY into the rc file. Similarly linux runs beautifully 
without a monitor when you make tty1 a link to ttys1 (this ought to be
documented somewhere really).

I too can vouch for this happening. I've been chasing it down and I
don't think its entirely the BIOS. I've tried two very similar machines
with AMI BIOS and AMD386 chips (33Mhz and 40Mhz). One one ctrl-alt-del
is fine (the DX40), the 33Mhz 386 however locks up solid. Interestingly
enough a ctrl-alt-del from windows 3 has the same effect.

I'm beginning to think its a chipset problem - unless you all happen
to have a WD8013EB card in the machines which lock up ?
