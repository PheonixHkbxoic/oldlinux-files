Things that remain to do
------------------------

*	There's no index either (look at the file 'index' for
	an off-the-top-of-my-head list of index items).

*	Using the Linux bootp client.

*	NIS support. (I recently read that there are copyright
	problems with Sun? Or is that just rumor?)

*	Remote printing

*	Automounter (amd)

*	Add PCNFS?

*	Improve the nslookup section.

*	Mention hostcvt in the DNS setup section.
