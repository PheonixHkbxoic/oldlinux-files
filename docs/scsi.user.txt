This is the user documentation for my SCSI package.

As is, the SCSI package works with seagate ST-02 and ST-01 host adapters.  Also,
the boot image is "hard wired" to an address of C8000h, as different revisions have 
different signatures, and version 2.00 is the only one I look for right now (my other
ST-02 is version 3.00, but that one is fried and hanging on the wall with other
dead computer junk - so it's sort of .... inaccessable for these purposes).

Note that adding another host adapter to the list of those supported represents a 
minimal amount of code.  Consult the "real" docs if you're interested.

SCSI disks are scanned for from ID 0 to ID 7, excluding the host adapter ID (typically 7).
They are assigned to disk 0, 1, 2, etc in the order they are found.

SCSI disks use major number 8, 16 minor numbers per drive, so the first hard disk
on your system will be 8,0, partition one on that 8,1, second drive 8,16, etc.
This is to accomodate a future sub partitioning scheme.

These devices may be made with mknod /dev/sdX 8 X, where X is the minor number, as         
specified above.

Note that the scsi disks will coexist with "normal" drives in the same system - 
IDE, MFM, whatever. 

Files you might want : 
scsi.shar.Z  - shell archive of the sources and some diffs.  Note that makefile diffs,
	main.c diff (one call) are not there - but it basically just drops in
	to .12.

fdisk.scsi.tar.Z : patched fdisk that also deals with SCSI drives.

bootimage-0.12.seagate.Z - bootable image for seagate ST-0x SCSI hosts at address C8000.
