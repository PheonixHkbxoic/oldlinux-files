<p><hr><h3>Linux Memory Savers
<p></p>
This page has various Linux memory saver patches that I have put together. 
</h3><hr></p>

There are still lots of people out there running Linux on 386 boxes with
4MB ram and older/smaller hard disks. These patches implement options
that will allow these users to trim some excess (unused) functionality
from their kernels and reclaim some of that valuable memory for running
applications. Note that memory taken up by the kernel is hardwired to
RAM and can't be swapped to disk, thus reducing the amount of real
memory available to run user programs and the like. 

<P>
Most of these patches are against the current 1.2.x kernel, as it is
a bit smaller than the 1.3.x kernels to begin with. If you are tight 
on memory, you are best to run the latest 1.2.x kernel as opposed to
the latest 1.3.x development series.

<hr>

Here are some of the areas where you can "trim the fat".

<a href="#ram">The RAM Disk</a><br>
<a href="#hd">The "old" Disk Driver</a><br>
<a href="#mod">The Modules Code</a><br>
<a href="#ini">The Old init Code</a><br>
<a href="#ser">The Serial Driver</a><br>
<a href="#flo">The Floppy Driver</a><br>

<a href="#ksw">The Kswap Patches</a><br>
<a href="#thi">Removing IBM ThinkPad Support</a><br>
<a href="#m386">The `-m386' GCC option</a><br>

<P>
As a more drastic alternative, you can `downgrade' to a 1.0.9 kernel.
For those that can't recall, this was the last (i.e. stable) release
of the 1.0 series before starting the 1.1 development series. As a quick
test, I compiled a 1.0.9 kernel `out of the box' to see how it compared
memorywise against my trimmed 1.2.13 kernel. It beat it hands down!
For my config, the trimmed 1.2.13 kernel weighed in at 512k code and
148kB data. The stock 1.0.9 kernel with the same config weighed in
at a mere 388kB code and 168kB data. I then quickly applied by hand
some of the above list (ram / modules / init / serial / ne2k / printk)
and had it down to a lean-n-mean 384kB code and 152kB data!! That is
a 104kB saving over the <em>trimmed</em> 1.2.13 kernel. This is an
excellent kernel to run on 4MB machines. Here is a
<a href="109.diff">patch</a>
against the 1.0.9 tree that incorporates the above five from the list.
Note that some (such as the Thinkpad hack or the reduced hd driver) don't 
apply to the 1.0.9 kernels, as they weren't in there yet to begin with,
so there is nothing to `fix' so to speak.

<p><h4><a name="ram">The RAM disk</h4></p>

Patch to make the <em>ramdisk</em> a config option. Face it, you never
use it except for boot/recovery disks and the like. Available for
<a href="ramdisk.1212">v1.2.12</a>.
With this in place, the file <code>ramdisk.c</code> is not even
compiled unless you select ramdisk support.
This should be another small memory saving that will help low memory 
machines.


<p><h4><a name="hd">The "old" disk driver</h4></p>

A patch to remove all IDE support from the "old" hard disk
driver. Seeing as <code>ide.c</code> now uses
all the IDE specific features in addition to the standard ST-506 hard
disk specification, the old
disk driver may as well return to its original featureless ST-506 form.
This will be a good choice for users with MFM/RLL or ESDI drives that
can use the memory savings a lot more than the IDE features. Users that
don't wish to use the extended features of their IDE drive(s) can also 
use this patch as well. There should be no risk in using this patch,
as all it mainly does is remove code that is IDE specific. I have
tested it in a two drive IDE system and a one drive MFM system.
Just compare the compiled sizes of hd.c with my patch, hd.c without my
patch, and ide.c as seen below, for 1.3.14. (This also doesn't account
for the extra 1/2kB per IDE drive that was dynamically allocated to
to store the IDE drive information.)

<P>

</code>

<P>
The "low-fat-diet" hard disk driver is available for
<a href="hd_diff-1212">v1.2.12</a> kernels.


<p><h4><a name="mod">The Modules Code</h4></p>

A patch to 
<a href="no_modules_patch">remove all module support</a> for those that are on
low memory machines, or those that never use modules. 
This is done
by using <code>``#ifdef CONFIG_MODULES''</code> and adding it as
a <em>make config</em> option. Note that this patch is for 1.2.x kernels.
I will eventually update it for the 1.3.x kernels.

<P>
For those who were complaining about the modules stuff adding bloat,
it can be pulled out quite easily.
A big win is dumping modules.c, ksyms.c and a good chunk of scsi.c 
for loading and unloading host adaptors.
Also gone are (un)register_netdev, unregister_filesystem and
(un)register_binfmt. Note that you *can't* dump register_fiesystem,
(un)register_blkdev and (un)register_chrdev because these are also 
used by non-modules. (However, this could be easily changed...)
Of course /proc/ksyms and /proc/modules disappear as well.

<P>
The only files that didn't include <code>&lt;linux/config.h&gt;</code>
already were scsi.c
and modules.c (ironic huh?) Of course the module syscalls are still
listed in unistd.h and entry.S, but they are just dummies that 
return -ENOSYS like those in kernel/sys.c, so that running insmod on 
a non-module kernel doesn't do anything silly. Hopefully this can
go into 1.3.x someday.

<p><h4><a name="ini">The Old init Code</h4></p>

Many moons ago, when more people had heard of <em>Minix</em> than
<em>Linux</em>,  Linux did not have Poe's or MvS's init packages.
The kernel would look for "/etc/rc" and/or "/bin/sh" to start as
process number one. Even now that "/etc/init" and lately "/sbin/init"
have been in widespread use for a long time, this old code still 
remains in the kernel. This
<a href="init.patch">patch</a> against 1.2.x kernels
removes that old code, along with a 1kB static buffer that it used.
Ideally this old code should be removed from distribution kernels
as well. (Thanks to Michael A. Griffith for reminding me of this one.)

<p><h4><a name="ser">The Serial driver</h4></p>

Almost all people have only two (or four) serial ports. Yet in
<code>drivers/char/serial.c</code> there is a large table of
possible serial devices called <code>rs_table</code>. This table
has 37 entries. You can safely delete all but the ones you are
using, that being the top two, or four if you have four serial
ports installed. (Thanks to Alan Cox for mentioning this one.)

<p><h4><a name="flo">The Floppy driver</h4></p>

The average person has at either a 1.44MB 3.5" drive, and/or a 1.2MB
5.25" drive. And they usually never use any strange floppy formats.
The usual formats are 360kB, 720kB, 1.2MB and 1.44MB, and <em>none</em>
of the others are used. This
<a href="floppy.diff">patch</a>
removes the support for 2.88MB drives, and for all the 30 or so other
formats that 99% of us never use.

<p><h4><a name="ne">The ne2000 driver</h4></p>

For ne2000 users, you can make a one line change to 
<code>drivers/net/ne.c</code> that will get rid of a large table of
non-conforming cards, and its associated code. If you don't have
a "bad clone" you can just delete or comment out the line that says
<P>
<code>
#define CONFIG_NE_BAD_CLONES
</code>
<P>

<p><h4><a name="3c">The 3c503 driver</h4></p>

As you may
or may not know, the 3c503 has the ability to support PIO transfers
to the card (akin to a ne2000) instead of the standard (read faster/better)
shared memory implementation.
However, since it is slower, you shouldn't use a 3c503 in PIO mode. 
If you do, the linux driver will print a message like 
"REJUMPER FOR SHARED MEMORY" at boot, and then still
try and use it in the crippled PIO mode.

<P>
This 
<a href="3c503.mem">patch</a> for the 1.2.x series kernels
just #ifdef's out all the PIO code based on whether you have
defined CONFIG_EL2_PIO, for a 20% reduction in the driver size, as
seen below.

<P>
With PIO support:<br>
<code>
text    data    bss     dec     hex<br>
3576    44      0       3620    e24<br>
-rw-------   1 root     root         4964 Apr 13 19:50 3c503.o<br>
</code>
<P>
Without PIO support:<br>
<code>
text    data    bss     dec     hex<br>
2700    44      0       2744    ab8<br>
-rw-------   1 root     root         4005 Apr 15 15:33 3c503.o<br>
</code>

<p><h4><a name="scsi">The SCSI blacklist</h4></p>

Some old (and even some new!) SCSI devices are poorly designed so that
if they are "asked" by the SCSI host adapter as to whether they contain
multiple devices such as a multiple disk CD-ROM, they will lock-up.
The kernel keeps a <em>huge</em> list of (at present 34) devices that 
have this problem in <code>drivers/scsi/scsi.c</code>.
You can cut this <code>device_list</code> down to just the
NULL entry at the end if you don't have any of these devices, or if you
configured your kernel to only ask about LUN #1.

<p><h4><a name="pri">The printk() Ring Buffer</h4></p>

The <code>printk()</code> routine uses a 4kB static ring buffer to store
kernel messages in while waiting for <code>klogd()</code> to read them.
The only time this many unread messages pile up is at boot before 
<code>klogd()</code> is started. But you can read those by using the
Shift+Page_Up key sequence. You can go into <code>kernel/printk.c</code>
and change the <code>#define LOG_BUF_LEN 4096</code> to a smaller value
like 512, for a saving of 3.5kB. This will still leave room for over 
six full (80 character) lines of kernel messages to be buffered.

<P>
There is also a 1kB buffer ("buf") allocated to deal with the incoming
data passed in with  a printk() call. No single printk() calls in the kernel 
are so huge (or broken) as to dump a whole kB in a single call, and so you 
can cut this back to 256 bytes, which is still the equivalent of more
than three full lines of text. (You could allocate this buffer
dynamically with kmalloc(), but things will get ugly if you run out of
memory, and then try to do allocate a buffer so you can do a
<code>printk("Out of memory\n");</code>!!!) 

<p><h4><a name="ksw">The Kswap Patches</h4></p>

These are patches by
<a href="mailto:sct@dcs.ed.ac.uk">Stephen C. Tweedie</a> who has also
done a lot of work on the ext2 filesystem. These patches don't actually
save you any memory, but instead they improve the swapping performance
on low memory machines. For more details on the gains/implementations
and such, here are some of Stephen's mails that I saved. (The dates
are encoded in the URLs)

<P>
Stephen's latest version of his kswap patches can be found
<a href="ftp://ftp.presence.co.uk/pub/linux/kswap">here</a>.

<p><h4><a name="thi">Removing IBM ThinkPad Support</h4></p>

Once again IBM has made an incompatibility. They seem to have done
something funny with the last 4kB of RAM at the end of the 640kB
region. The Linux kernel won't touch this 4kB by default for fear
of upsetting the IBM ThinkPad. If you don't have an IBM ThinkPad,
you can re-claim this 4kB by simply changing the value <tt>0x9f000</tt> 
to an <tt>0xA0000</tt> in <tt>linux/arch/i386/mm/init.c</tt>. 
If you are real lazy, here is a <a href="thinkpad">patch</a> 
for the 1.2.x kernels to do that for you. (Thanks to Thomas Graichen
for pointing this one out.)

<p><h4><a name="m386">The `-m386' GCC option</h4></p>

When you compile a kernel with the `-m486' option, GCC then alignes
internal data structures on data boundaries that will be favourable
for the cache structure on an i486 CPU. This can leave small `holes'
between the end of one data structure, and the start of another, which
accounts for the slightly larger output. So if you compile linux with
`-m386' instead, then you will end up with a slightly smaller (actually
more tightly packed) kernel. You won't be able to notice any significant
performace decrease in everyday usage either.
